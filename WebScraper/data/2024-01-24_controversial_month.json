They told me that it's good that I go on these walks. I then told them, lately I've been passing out (due to insomnia and trouble sleeping at night, as well as being burnt out) and missing out on them- they said I should try my hardest to continue doing it though.Last night, I woke up at 9:46, then decided to go on a walk. The next morning I was confronted. She said because I went out I wouldn't be able to meet my girlfriend (we’re long distance and barely see each other). I think, as well as my girlfriend, that I shouldn't go unpunished.. but that I also shouldn't have someone held over my head – especially seeing as it'd be punishing her too.",

I asked her why she had never told me before and she said that it just never came up because we only talk in short spurts, and she didn’t think it would be an issue because we usually get a sitter for a night when I come home.I told her that it isn’t right and she’s wasting money selfishly, because she gets breaks during the day and after our son goes to bed, and it’s wrong to leave him when I have to work 24/7 on business trips. I told her I didn’t want her to do it again but she got upset because she didn’t think it was fair.",

My daughter pays no rent, had her college paid for by scholarships and my ex's inheritance which went completely to her.Recently my son has been wanting a new graphics card for his computer as he is an avid gamer and his current one doesn't work well with his monitor. He knows computers quite well.My daughter recently bought herself a new computer and sold her old one in partsAccording to my son my daughter's computer has two graphics cards and she isn't using one of them (the monitor is plugged in to the one she uses). The one she uses is from her old computer (5600xt) and the one she doesn't use is 4090He says because she doesn't use windows and uses Linux the other one is useless to her and would suit his needs and he can exchange it with his current graphics card (2070).I asked her to exchange it with her brother and she refused initially but when I reminded her about how it would be a gesture and how I don't charge her rent despite being an earning adult she reluctantly agreed but still lied and claimed she uses it despite a monitor never being plugged in.She said she used it as it made school easier for when she is not on campus even though she plays very few games and is usually typing text documents.However since the exchange she has been acting quite unpleasantly, not saying much and banging things when she does chores.AITA here? I get that it is hers but I feel like if it's something that came with her computer that she doesn't use, it makes sense for her to give it to my son who would actually use it to upgrade his older computer especially since she already saves a lot on rent.",

They only get up out of bed at around 11 am after I tell them to. Their only chore is to wash dishes, but they hardly do that.Today, I was fed up with not having room in the kitchen and I yelled at T to get up.

He finally managed to get my older son living with him and because the courts kept my younger son with me we now only see the other child every other weekend so the boys can spend weekends together. I filed for child support but because we make around the same, it was set at 0 with us splitting medical costs and him covering insurance.So before when both kids lived with me primarily I paid for everything for them - medical, extracurriculars, etc.  my ex paid my rent and phone bill and paid for stuff for the kids separate from me. He however decided he didn’t owe any support anymore when the custody became 50/50 even though its his job as a father to support his family.Now that my older son is with him he constantly hounds me for money that I can’t afford because I work part time now and have a baby with my new partner to take care of. I also pay for my younger son (clothes, food, haircuts, school supplies, doctors visits) and never ask him for anything for him.  He feels that because he still pays on his own decision for clothing and shoes for my younger son that I am a “deadbeat” for not providing for my older son (I do still pay for half my older son’s braces which is like 100/month and for birthday/xmas gifts and got him a backpack for school).Some things my ex keeps asking for:half of my son’s contact lens feeshalf of copays for medical proceduresmoney for his extracurriculars which are OPTIONAL and cost way too muchhalf of school field trip feesI keep telling him I don’t have the money and now he is heavily implying I don’t care about my older son and that my older son is way more expensive than my younger son so me not contributing to his expenses is basically “deadbeat” status.  The most hurtful thing he has said is that my kids stepmom provides more for my older son than I do because I won’t “step up” which is terrible and unfair because she makes way more money as it is.So am I wrong for refusing?",

You know, the (people of my great grandfather’s origin) will pronounce it SER-CHAY.”The aunt actually speaks the language.

My daughter loved this new name so much she insisted on pronouncing it as the aunt showed her.

I read it aloud for her.She said there are 8 people here includings interns and med students and herself and no one was able to read that except for the one who wrote it. So she asked for the paper. I gave it to her. She threw it in the trash and said 'it belongs there if no one can read it'.

Liz has beautiful curly hair (dyed) ginger, I don’t know much about curls but looking at references i think she might have 3b or 3c hair.Last week she came to church with pin straight hair and her natural brown color. I was totally taken aback since she never straightened her hair, not even to formal events, and had been dying her hair for years. I asked what was the occasion, thinking she just straightened it with an iron, and she told me she got it straightened with keratin.I asked her why did she destroy her hair, and she told me I knew she had been really depressed and she wanted something “she could control”. I know she has been depressed. Around two months ago she underwent a knee surgery and has been walking with a cane, and just before new year her dog had to be put down. I get getting haircuts after being sad but i thought that was ridiculous.Her hair was the most identifiable part of her,  the way she would style it was very fun and you could find her easily in a crowd. Today i tried to find her at church and told her that without her hair she was harder to find, this bothered me because now she just melts with the crowd and isn’t that special anymore. At lunch i told her i missed her old hair and felt like she had lost her fun personality with her hair.She didn’t reply but i noticed she was upset, our friend that was with us at lunch told me that was mean, I didn’t think i was but maybe i should apologize, AITA?edit: okay i get it, i’ll apologize to her tomorrowedit 2: this morning at 9 am i texted her apologizing for my reaction to her hair. I told her i was just shocked at the drastic change, that she looks beautiful and i hope her new hair is easy to maintain. She replied with two audio messages 30 minutes later, i saw the messages but was too busy so I waited until i was free to reply. At 6pm i check the chat and realize she deleted the audio messages so I explained to her that i was busy, to send them again, but Liz replied “it’s fine, it doesn’t matter anymore” so i said great.Thanks to everyone who commented, I apologized and I think maybe shes a little hurt but we’ll get over it as friends.edit 3: today Liz was not at church, I ran into her boyfriend and asked where she and her sister were (she lives alone with her 15yo sister) and he is the one that drives them. He told me that she didn’t feel like going so she stayed. I texted her asking how she was and if could come over and bring them lunch, she answered that she didn’t want anyone to come over, that she was tired from work and didn’t want visitors. So i told her that if she needed to talk to anyone to text me.Around 6pm i saw an instagram story posted by her sister of the three of them in the movies (the story was posted like 2 hours ago) so i texted her that i wanted to talk to her and is she wanted i could go to her place or we could talk on the phone, it’s 7pm and she hasn’t replied so i’ll be waiting.",

So, when I told her my family decided to go on this trip, she asked if she could come too. I told her I was pretty sure my parents would say no, so there was no point in asking. I thought that was the end of it, I was wrong. Flash forward to a week before the trip, she asked if I had asked if she could come. This caught me off guard because she doesn’t normally push stuff like this. I told her that like I said, there was no point in asking, and it felt kind of like she was taking advantage of my parents’ kindness. She said it felt like it was a slap in the face and said that I was being ridiculous because she had refused my parents financial help in the past and that it doesn’t matter where they were going, she just wanted to spend the holiday with me. It really felt like she was trying to get a free vacation out of me and my family, so I may have been a little harsh about it, but I still think I was right.

It was a great occasion to catch up with my extended family, some of whom I hadn't seen in years. After dinner, my aunt made a pot of coffee, and someone noticed that \"It's a Wonderful Life\" was playing on TV.I consider this movie a Christmas classic, and I've probably seen it a dozen times or more, but my wife had never seen it, so we sat down and watched it from start to finish. When we got to the part where George Bailey is taken around Bedford Falls by Clarence, my wife began to cry. I asked her what was wrong, and she said that it was tragic that George had all sorts of opportunities in life, to get educated, travel, etc., and personal matters keot getting in his way. I couldn't believe that this was her reaction, as she had clearly missed the entire point of the movie. George was about to jump off the bridge because he was mistaken that his life was meaningless.I turned to my wife and asked if it would be better if Mr. Potter had taken over everything, and she said that \"both options were sad.\" One of the options was clearly sadder than the other, and I didn't see any of my other relatives crying. I told my wife that she was embarrassing us with her reaction and that she should stop crying. She was ruining what was meant to be a happy and lighthearted Christmas film, and I'm convinced that she was disturbing my family as well. When we finally left, my wife had pulled herself together, and she told me in the car that I had been cruel to her. She said that the \"only one who embarrassed us was me\" and that people have \"different reactions to movies.\" I asked her if anyone laughed at the end of \"Old Yeller,\" and she kind of went silent and shook her head. She muttered under her breath \"You're such an asshole.\"I don't know what to even say to her. Christmas Day was quite awkward, and she barely said two words to me.

We have a set time everyday to call so we avoid scheduling anything during that time as much as possible.I'm flying out on Friday for a competition in which my team and I will be representing our university. During this time, I won't be able to talk to him at all for the next several days (phone policies + being busy with the competition). Thursday at our usual time is the last time we would be able to call before I leave.This is where the problem started... After I told him how I wouldn't be able to talk to him for several days and how Thursday would be the last time, he asked to call earlier in the day on Thursday (mind you, I have classes/office hours earlier so this makes things very hard, at least to talk our usual amount of time). I was confused so I asked him why. He said that a video game was coming out during the time we usually start calling and that he'd like to play it then.I started arguing with him saying he can wait an hour and a half until I have to leave to begin playing. I didn't see why he had to start playing it the literal second it came out. He argued back saying that he'd been waiting for this game for years and that he wanted to play as much as possible before he went back to work (he goes back the day I come back. In other words, he has nothing to do all day except game while I'm gone). I explained that he can play as much as he wants while I'm gone and he'll have extra time especially because we won't be talking like usual. But he's completely refusing to budge on this. He says that he offered to call earlier that day and if that doesn't work for me then we simply won't call at all.Honestly, I was very angry. He knows how much time and energy I put into this. He knows that I am extremely nervous considering it's the first time I've ever flown out for a school competition. He knows that I've never been a captain before and that this is a really huge deal to me.I accused him of prioritizing the video game over me and he just agreed to it and didn't really see the problem. He says whenever I miss a call, that I've prioritize something else over him but I don't really see how that makes sense? If he ever told me he needed me or was not okay with me not calling, I would 100% cancel to talk to him (unless it was something I literally can't get out of).He said he was done talking about this and that his decision was final and I'd have to deal with it and then he hung up on me. I messaged him back asking what the fuck his problem was and now he's mad at me for swearing.AITA?EDIT: Not sure why I'm being spam downvoted for random replies I make.

All I know is that he is playing on his own. We had no conversation about this game beforeEDIT 3: This is not a vacation, this is a competition. We have a schedule that we have to adhere to, there are rules we have to adhere to. I didn't make these rules, I'm just forced to follow them. Not doing so can result in disqualifications. For those saying it's ridiculous that I can't spare an hour a day to call during it: I am able to call once I got back to the hotel! He will be asleep during that time due to time zone differences though so it's not possible in the end. I literally can't at any other time.",

Amy is the type who's a bit scatterbrained, always misplacing her stuff. About three weeks ago, we went hiking and she left her backpack in my car. It wasn't anything fancy, just a regular old backpack.I didn't think much of it at first. But as days passed, the backpack just sat there in my car, taking up space. I figured Amy must've forgotten about it or it wasn't that important since she hadn't mentioned it. To be honest, I was getting a bit annoyed about it cluttering up my car.So, after about two weeks, I decided to clean up. The backpack didn't seem to contain anything of value – I didn't thoroughly check it, just a quick glance. It looked like some papers, a water bottle, and maybe a shirt. I thought to myself, \"Amy probably won't miss this,\" and made the decision to donate it to a local charity shop. I felt it was a good deed, giving something to someone who might actually need it.Fast forward to last week, Amy asks me about her backpack. She said it had some important work-related documents, a spare set of keys, and a flash drive with sentimental photos. I was taken aback. I told her that I had donated it, thinking it wasn't anything significant.Amy got really upset, saying that I should've asked her before doing anything with her belongings. She said it was irresponsible and thoughtless of me. I tried explaining my side, that it was just sitting there and I assumed it wasn't anything important. Plus, it's been weeks, and she never mentioned it.I feel like she's overreacting a bit. Yes, I probably should've checked with her, but also, shouldn't she be more careful with her things? So, AITA here for donating the backpack without asking her first?",

He's always had a ton of girlfriends, or just random girls he met at bars over at our place when I was younger, they were always gorgeous and i remember them always spoiling me with sweets, or doing my make up etc.Not too long ago, Liam married a woman (Meg, 36) he had met at work. It's awful, we had to move to her house, which resulted in me having move schools to one where I have no friends. She's always moaning about me. They're also expecting a baby in April, which I am dreading. Meg despises me, I'm pretty sure. She's making me follow all the rules she's created (no make up, no dressing how i want, no diets or going out), and she always talks bad about me to my dad. She's totally changed him as well, he just acts old and dresses not at all like himself - he's boring now, nothing like what he used to beThe other day, Meg and I got into an argument about my uniform. I rolled my skirt up a bit and I had make-up as well as fake nails on. She came into my room and started yelling, tell me to put my skirt down and take my make up off, I yelled back that everyone has their skirt rolled up, and that i'm not taking my make up off because most of it is minimal. Besides, Dad did take me to get lash extensions, so I can't just take them out.Liam ended up getting involved, he said to me that i shouldn't rile my step-mam up and just to 'roll the damn skirt down'. I then told him that it's not my fault he's not attractive anymore and had to settle for   Meg, and he shouldn't let her think she's my mam now.Since then, dad's been short with me for insulting him and his wife, and Meg has been even harder on me, saying that they got married because she is a decent, responsible woman and not because she looks like a doll. I've felt a bit bad about it too, because I know Meg's insecure about her looks, and doesn't like thinking about my dad's exes, who were all practically model material.",

	"body" : "My GF and I have been living together for 5 months now. It’s been a bit of a learning curve but we’re adjusting. But like every couple, we have our episodes of bickering. To preface I am a very particular person. Especially with the correct use of utensils, placement of items in the household such as food and appliances and most relevant not leaving dishes overnight. With that being said my GF and I have a set of “terms and conditions” that we mutually abide by in the relationship. One of those being “ if one of us cooks, the other washes the dishes”. Now, I actually hate doing the dishes. Before this condition was set in stone it was an unspoken tradition. Though on occasion she would cook and I would ask her to clean and vise versa. To eliminate that frustration we had made this rule.  When she makes dinner I always wash the dishes before we go to bed, while she’d rather do them in the morning which I CAN’T STAND. Growing up I was never allowed to leave dishes over night and now it has stuck with me. It’s not only unsanitary but it can attract bugs. My GF just doesn’t understand that and we bicker about it every other day. Today I had enough.  I cooked like most days, and after I  relaxed and got comfortable. With it getting late I had insisted on my GF doing the dishes since she said she would after dinner. She gives me her signature line “can’t I just do it in the mornin?” NOOOO GOD NOO WHY CANT SHE JUST  DO THEM. Like she knows it makes my skin crawl, that’s why we have that condition. But after talking about it I realized I may have been dramatic and apologized for my reaction. BUT THEN SHE HAD THE AUDACITY TO SAY, “I’ll do half tonight and the other half tomorrow” LIKE THAT DEFEATS THE PURPOSE, THERES STILL DISHES IN THE SINK OVERNIGHT RIGHT!?! She believes that I am “doing too much” and that they will get cleaned eventually. I threw a fit and asked her “how did that make any sense?” To she followed with “Don’t worry about it there is no compromising with you, it has to always be your way”. So AITA for being so insistent on when the dishes are done and arguing with my gf about it?",

I am 55M, wife 55F, son 22M, daughter 19F, daughter 18F.We weren't sure what we wanted to do. Kids weren't enthusiastic about going anywhere, but wife really wanted to do something all together. Yesterday we still didn't have any concrete plans, so I decided we would go to a large city in a nearby country to celebrate since they have a popular event happening every New Year. My wife also likes this idea. We will drive there tomorrow, celebrate New Year there, likely stay another night, and then come back home Jan 2.The problem is my son cannot come since his passport is within 6 months of expiry. Also he has a dog and it's too late to find a sitter for his dog. So he is upset we chose somewhere he can't go. But he didn't like any of the nearby suggestions my wife made before anyway. He said he just preferred we all stayed home to celebrate like always, just eating together and playing some games.So AITA for choosing this destination he cannot go to, even though he didn't want to go anywhere anyway? He can stay home as he likes and I will take my wife and daughters on the trip since they don't have passport issues or a dog. I think he is just mad because yesterday I got some items at work that I gave to my daughters and wife. He is already working and making money, so he doesn't need a gift. Gifts for daughters were only worth around $200 and for wife it is half that. He is making everything about going his way.",

	"body" : "Throw awayI (42M) have a son (15m). In March of 2022 my wife and my sons mother passed away. This was devastating for the both of us. After 6 months I met this amazing woman who is now my wife. We both had spouses who died and we connected that way. We got married 5 months dating. (I know it was fast) My wife (39F) have a son (15m) and a daughter (16m). Our family blending process has had its challenges, but overall, things have been going well. My son seemed to love having siblings and loved my wife. However things started to change once they moved in (October 2023) because our house only have 3 bedrooms and so my Son had to share with his step brother while his step sister have a room by herself. We told the kids that this is only temporary and after this school year ends we will move into a much bigger house.After my stepson moved in the room with my son, he has been displaying disrespectful behavior towards his stepmother and stepsiblings. He's often rude and hateful. If he is asked to do something my my wife he'll roll his eyes or ignore her and not do it. He has locked his stepbrother out of his room multiple times and doesn't open the door until I threaten to take his phone or games away. Yesterday he decided it would be nice to lock my wife and step siblings out of the house while I was away at work. (She forgot her keys in the house) My wife called me and I had to drive home and leave work just to unlock the door. To say I was furious was an understatement.I decided to take my sons electronics away including his phone. I told him he's not allowed to go anywhere other than to and from school until I say so. I told him he is going to apologize and he is going to mean it. I'll admit I didn't say it as nicely as I wrote it but I was just angry that I had to leave work for dumb reason.My son is upset and feels I'm being unfair. He said that he never wanted to have a new family and he's getting punished for it. He said that he can't believe I'll choose my fake family over him. I told him that that's not true and I love him with all my heart.I said that he's not allowed to treat his step siblings or my wife and Im sorry you don't but that's no reason to treat them like trash when they treat you with love and respect. I told him that his stepsiblings didn't ask for this family either and that him acting this way towards them was selfish and inconsiderate. He then told me he wish I was the once who died. When he said that my heart broke and I left his room. I've been crying myself to sleep lately because I feel like I failed as a father and that's not something I wanted to do. I tried talking to my son but all he never verbally answers me. The best I get is a nod. I talked to with his grandparents (My ex wife's parents) and they suggested family therapy and I think imma try to do that. I've talked to my wife I'm contemplating on moving houses earlier than anticipated.Edit: I'm going to apologize to my son for dismissing his feelings and apologize. I never intended on hurting my son. I will try to put me and him into therapy. I just assumed he was happy about the marriage because he seemed happy about having stepsiblings up until October. I understand I'm the asshole, I understand I'm not good person, and I understand I'm not a good father. I will do everything I can to show my Son I love him. Thanks for putting it all in perspective.Edit again: I decided the best thing I could do for me and my son would be to divorce my wife. I love her, but I love my son more. I will be talking to her tomorrow.Edit 3: I allowed my son to stay home today so we can talk and I took a day off of work. I apologized to my son for making him feel unloved and told him that I was blinded by love and was too invested in my feelings and didn't consider his. I explained to him that I loved him with all my heart and I never intended on hurting him. I explained that when His mother died I was completely heartbroken and when I met my current wife she remined me so much of her and that I fell in love. I told him I'm sorry that I hurt him and I don't want him to hate me. He apologized to me and told me that he saw mom in my current wife too and he said that he felt like I didn't love him as much anymore and felt that when His step brother moved in his room he felt like he was being replaced. This made me cry. I apologized again and told my son I'm sorry forcing him to be in a family he wasn't ready for. My son said he doesn't want me to divorce my wife but he would like it if they would move out. I told him that I'll let this move in our new house from the time being because they have no where else to go. He said okay. Now I'm waiting for my wife to get off of work so we can talk about them moving and the future of our relationship.Edit: My wife called my Son Spoiled and a Brat so I'm filing for divorce. I'm giving her 3 weeks to get out of my house. I'm letting her take the new house I BOUGHT until she can find a place on her own simply because her kids had nothing to do with this and I don't want them to be homeless. I didn't know she felt that way about my son. However, my son wasn't near when she said that. We talked to the kids and told them about the divorce. My step daughter seemed fine, but my step son got upset and said I'm abandoning him just like his father and he started crying. I told him I would still like to have a relationship with him and I still consider him my son it's just that me and his mom are divorcing. He told me to Shut the fuck up and leave him alone and now he's crying in his room. Now it's tense in the house and I might consider her leaving earlier. I never expected it to end up like this.",

We have our squabbles but apparently this one has really pushed my girlfriend over the edge.Last spring, her parents let us know they and their friends were planning a group trip to Aruba and that we would be invited to join them. It’s an all inclusive resort and my girlfriend is super excited because she’s never been to a resort this nice before. I’m indifferent because I grew up in a warm climate, so I don’t understand why people from colder areas have an obsession with booker tropical vacations. What’s wrong with going to Europe?Anyways, we were told the trip would be in April, so we told them we were in. Before we paid the deposit to lock in our spots, her parents called her to let her know one person in the group couldn’t do April. Apparently, thats an end of the year time for their job and it’s all hands on deck, so they couldn’t get the time off. My GF let me know about the change before confirming with her parents we were still in. We paid our deposit and got locked in.At the time, I told her it was fine. Here’s where I might be the AH. We were talking about the trip the other night, this is literally all she wants to talk about. I finally brought up to her that I was annoyed about the date change as March is towards the end of ski season, and I like to get in as many runs as I possibly can. Also, it’s spring break time so the resorts are going to be flooded with annoying college kids.I told her it didn’t make sense to me to change the dates because one person couldn’t go. She explained to me that it wouldn’t have been fair for them to miss the trip because they couldn’t take that time off of work. She then told me I was being selfish because I go skiing almost every weekend and sometimes even during the week, I can afford to miss a few days of skiing.I personally just don’t think she understands where I’m coming from. She doesn’t ski, so she doesn’t understand my passion for it. I’ve also traveled a lot with my family, so I don’t see the big deal of this trip. So AITAH?Update: clearly you all think I’m the AH, along with calling me a narcissist. I’m probably just going to cancel my trip since I have the insurance on it, and use the time I requested off to ski before the season ends. I’ll tell my girlfriend at some point, but I’m gonna wait.

This is where things turned amusing, as my wife is a vegetarian and has been since she was four years old, whereas I am not. This has created some \"interesting\" situations between us historically, but this one at my BIL's was the most entertaining by far!My wife, quite seriously, stated to me that I will never be able to cook or eat fish in our house ever again if we kept them as pets. Me thinking there would be some ironic/hypocritical logic behind her statement asked her to confirm her reasoning, which she stated very passionately was actually that it would be cruel to do so where our fishy pets could smell the fish being cooked and see me eating them. At that moment, quite taken aback by what my wife had just depicted, my BIL and I caught each other's eye and proceeded to wet ourselves laughing.Clearly having gone over my wife's head as to why we were in such fits of laughter, my BIL and I started to depict some of the differences between gasses and liquids, as well as the intelligence levels and emotional consciousness of fish... but kept laughing too much, both at my wife's annoyance at us as well as our laughter perpetuating each other.Numerous references were made between us two for the rest of the afternoon, including designing solutions to catch and condense the steam produced when cooking any fish to then add to the fish tank's water in order to experiment with how our fishy pets would react. We again found this highly amusing (no doubt you would would needed to have been there to have laughed about it as much as we did), but my wife did not.My wife was, and still is today, very annoyed by us laughing at her expense having realised that her scientific logic was not prevailing at that moment in time. With further silly statements, ideas and GIFS shared within our family WhatsApp group, I am still firmly in the doghouse.I get that our reactions might have been a little over the top and we may have taken it a bit too far, but considering how funny my BIL and I found it, can I not enjoy myself a little at my wife's expense rather than being subjected to her being clearly disgruntled with my behaviour.

We talked back and forth as to what workload does he have to not be able to take additional days.I calmly and softly explained to him why this short vacation was needed and it was just for him to relax and rest a bit.To make it short, he finished the conversation in an ordering and angry manner saying “I can’t.

Before the most recent argument, there have been a few other incidents in the past few months where we disagreed on gifts/donations.

Recently, I've started fronting the bill (since no one else wants to) - with the expectation for everyone to pay me back, I've made it very clear that I expect everyone to pay me back and they've paid me back in the past without any problem.Recently we went to a normally priced restaurant like we have hundreds of times, however some of the members of my group brought some friends whom I didn't know. One of these \"friends\" I didn't know was named Alex. I told everyone very clearly that I was fronting for the check and I expected to be paid back however Alex \"forgot\" (intentionally or not) to pay me back later. So I sent him a message to pay me back and I started getting called a bad person for that since the cost of eating didn't effect me at all. Alex decided to straight up say he wasn't paying for his portion and then stopped responding.So I later made it very clear I would take him to small claims court even if it exceeded the cost of the meal.AITA for asking for the money back, and then threatening legal action?",

	"title" : "AITA for refusing to throw an extra party?",
	"body" : "My son J (M25) is engaged to a woman D (F24/25). In D’s culture it’s traditional for the mother-in-law (me) to throw a party for the bride. J said to me that he’d really appreciate it if I did so and it would “make D feel like part of the family”. The issue I have with this is threefold. First of all, D’s mother is already throwing her a bridal shower. Throwing her a second one would just be repetitive. Second of all, J and I are not even part of D’s culture, and I wouldn’t feel comfortable taking part in activities like that for risk of offending or appropriating her culture. Third of all, and this is where I fear I’ll come across as an asshole, D isn’t part of the family, not until she and my son are wed. So it feels wrong to me to celebrate her as a family member when, let’s be honest, she isn’t.I laid this all out to J, who had basically no reaction at first. He just sat and listened for my reasons. Afterwards he shrugged and went “alright then”. This conversation happened a couple weeks ago, and since then he’s been avoiding me. Even when we talk things are stiff. I figured he was upset about something I said during that talk so we talked about it last night. I asked him how he felt about what I said and whether I upset him. I’m paraphrasing he essentially said that he wasn’t surprised, but just disappointed.He said that he wasn’t surprised because my husband and I never threw him parties, we never celebrated his achievements or anything and it was disappointing to hear that that extended to D as well. I was kind of struck dumb by this because yes, my husband and I are not celebratory people by nature, but we always showed him to the best of our ability that we loved him. To that end I said I’d be willing to compromise in a way, and said that after the wedding and their honeymoon I’d love to take D out to lunch or dinner with my friends and just get some girl time with her.He was very upset by now and said that that wasn’t what this is about and stormed off. Whatever civility we’ve had before is gone now. I truly feel like I’ve extended an olive branch and he’s swatting it away. AITA for this?",

	"title" : "AITA for asking my mom for the same opportunity my sisters got?",
	"body" : "I (f18) have 3 sisters, 23, and 19 year old identical twins. My mom (54) is the breadwinner of our family, she’s the cheerleading coach at a large university. All of my sisters cheered in college, but the twins for my mom currently and my eldest sister just graduated. Although my moms denies it, I believe slight nepotism is involved as there’s not a statistical way I have 3 sisters cheer there without nepotism being involved.I cheered competitively pretty much my entire life until 2 years ago. I quit because I was done dealing with the politics on the team and the bullying I received from one teammate. My mom was supportive of me quitting competitive cheer as long as I did my final 2 school season which I did.I had always been very skinny and I kept that way for cheer, but after quitting competition cheer and with my school stunts being pretty much nothing, I realized I didn’t need to stay skinny any longer. For the first time in my life, I ate how I pleased and didn’t feel the need to exercise an excess amount, and I gained around 40 lbs. None of my friends or family have commented negatively on my gain until recently which I was very thankful for.As college approaches for me, I’ve decided that I’d like to cheer again. I asked my mom if I could cheer for the team just like my sisters, and she said no. She claims that because I didn’t do it competitively she couldn’t justify it and that I’ve gotten too out of shape, and she simply couldn’t keep her job if she allowed me on the team.My eldest sister wasn’t good at cheer at all, and the twins aren’t amazing. I feel like my mom is ashamed of having a daughter with fuller hips. I called my mom out on her fat phobia, and she claims that I am fat and if I can’t handle the truth I need to lose weight. This caught me off guard because in two years of me having a more full figure she never said anything remotely like this.I don’t want to be the only one of 4 sisters who don’t cheer in college, and I don’t want to just be a fat girl in the stands compared to my sisters cheering. My mom has apologized for her comments and has tried to say it’s more because I’ve not cheered competitively in years, but I know after her outburst that day it’s because of my figure and her embarrassment of my curves.I understand it’s nepotism, but there aren’t a set number of spots and it’s just who my mom wants. My dad is on my mom's side and said I understood that when I quit cheer this would happen, and my sisters won’t really publicly pick a side, but they have begun to make sly remarks on my weight out of nowhere. My friends do believe I’m in the right but know they’re biased and would support me regardless. I have begun portion control and lost 4 lbs, but it won’t be enough to get to where I was. I now rarely speak to my mom and while I feel like I have some blame I don’t think I’m the a-hole in this situation. AITA?",

	"body" : "I’m posting this because I really was to see his point of view but I’m having trouble doing so.My boyfriend brought up earlier that one time when we were laying in bed together, I asked him to get me a glass of water from downstairs. He said he didn’t like that because it was showing my ego. From his perspective, we were both comfortable and warm in bed and I could’ve gotten up to get it myself. Why should he get up and do it when I’m perfectly capable of it? He also said I was being lazy.I explained that yes, I was comfortable in bed and that is probably why I asked him to grab me some water in that moment. But I asked because it was something I would appreciate from him, and it would make me happy. Why wouldn’t he want to do that simple gesture? I’m having trouble wrapping my head around his resistance for doing nice things for me.I told him if he asked me to do the same of course I would because I want to make him happy and I know it’s something he’d appreciate. He said he would never ask me to do that though, because he’s perfectly capable of doing it himself.Am I letting my ego show? Please help, I don’t want to be an asshole :(Edit: My own curiosity has gotten the best of me. Those who are commenting, I would love to know if you are currently in relationship. I wonder if this has any baring over one’s opinion? I’ve been getting very mixed responses and am genuinely curious.Edit 2: Someone said I should add this comment I made to give more context since here it is!“Not trying to defend myself (well, I guess by definition I am haha) but when I think about it I do feel I do things for my boyfriend to try and show I care. I’ll clean his apartment when he’s at work, make the bed for him even though it’s not something he does for himself, etc. I think this might be why I didn’t think it was the biggest deal to ask him to do a favor for me.”Edit 3 (and most likely final): A lot more people have chimed into this post than I initially expected. I’ve been trying to respond to people who have (mostly) civil.Wanted to clear a few things up: A lot of people have been mentioning I am “playing mind games” by asking if he could get me a glass of water. While I can’t know for sure if that’s what I was doing subconsciously, I promise it was not that deep lol. It was such a fleeting moment. To me I was just asking a favor, just as he has asked me in other scenarios.I didn’t demand, I asked. And he said sure. A LOT of assumptions are being made about the type of people my boyfriend and I are. If you need more info, just ask me to clarify and I’ll be upfront and honest. It’s crazy to me that people are assuming I “constantly nag” and am “purposefully manipulating” him. Same goes for my boyfriend, please don’t assume he’s a terrible person I should just ditch. After reading through the comments, I think at the end of the day we show our love in different ways. A lot of people have been saying my love language is acts of service and it made sense to me.Edit 4: Forgot to mention another assumption being made. This is my fault for not being clear in the comments. We weren’t laying in bed saying our goodnights with the lights out. We were watching TV and both occasionally getting up to go to the bathroom or something like that. Not sure if this makes a difference for people.",

Out of all the names they could have landed on, they decided to name him Luca, after my ex, Luke. Luke and I broke up several months ago and it wasn't an amicable end to the relationship. However, Luke and my friends bf (Ben) are best friends and workmates, and they used to live together before Ben moved in with his gf, so they're extremely close. Apparently close enough for Ben to suggest naming his son after him.My friend knows our relationship didn't end well, so I was pretty hurt when I found out she was honouring him by naming her son after him. She told me that Luca was a name she'd loved forever, and that Luke is someone who is a really important part of Ben's life so the name just made sense. I don't understand why they couldn't honour any other male in either of their lives, such as their fathers or brothers, or even just use Luca as a middle name, but I can't change their opinions so whatever.I don't want to be reminded of my ex every time I see my friend's baby, so instead I decide to call him Jamie whenever I'm playing with him, from his middle name, James. I even made him a blanket embroided with that nickname. I don't see a problem, because I think it's perfectly normal for people to have nicknames that are only used by one person. Even for myself, my uncle has his own nickname for me that no one else uses. But my friend got upset when she saw the blanket and heard me addressing him by that name, saying it was childish and disrespectful and it was erasing part of her son's identity.I asked her what she expected from me after naming her son after my ex, and she told me that I was being self-centred and that just because I had a bad relationship with Luke, doesn't mean she or Ben did, so I can't expect her to take into account my feelings with everything related to her son.I think that not naming her son after a person who I just ended a long term relationship with is not a farfetched request at all, and her violating that request is just an invitation for me to address her son by whatever nickname I choose.Also it's worth noting that Me and Luke where together before her and Ben were, so it's not like she had known Luke for a long period of time or had any sort of relationship or interactions with him before I started dating him.So AITA?",

He constantly gets rejected in real life and has literally no matches on any apps (he showed me, besides scammers nothing). He is really worried because he is getting older and time is running out to find someone to start a family.It is very hard for him to save money after rent and I felt that him buying a house would give him some stability and allow him to save more of his paycheck and also make him more desirable for women. For this reason, I decided to gift him a down-payment on a house so he can pay a mortgage that will be less than his rent.However this started a disagreement with my daughter because she feels she should get money now as well. Her situation however is very different. She is younger, doesn't want to get married or have kids. She is objectively very good looking and literally complains about men asking her out all the time, gets cat called everywhere she goes etc.She has a degree from Berkley, worked at Meta and then got laid off and while she is struggling a little bit since the lay off due to student loans, she is a software engineer so she will eventually be making a lot of money as it is a lucrative field, more than enough for someone who wants to be single.

I messaged the group chat and said that if dirty dishes kept being left on the side then I’d throw them away - she replied and said she was understanding that it’s frustrating but a lot of the dishes are hers and I’d be punishing her for someone else’s uncleanliness.

We have one child already, and I'm 20 weeks pregnant with a second. My husband has been very supportive of this, and because he is quite well off, I can take as much time off of work as possible.The reason for this post is the fact that while growing our family is great and all that, one of the main obstacles right now is the car my husband has.  It's big I guess, but it's only 5 seats. I was thinking that by the time our second kids come, we could have a 7-8 seater car. The size hike would be convenient for us in my opinion. I talked to my husband about it, but he's not exactly on board with the idea. He thinks his current car is big enough for 4 or even 5 people. I can see why he might not want to trade in, given that he's only had for 3-4 ish years, and he only paid it off about a year ago, but I proposed the idea of just trading in. With the car that he has, buying any full size SUV will go for about 15,000-25,000 after the trade-in value.The discussion turned into more of an argument, and one thing led to another to the point where I said that he doesn't seem to care about me or my future kids wellbeing and I left.

	"body" : "Hello AITA community, I'm in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some outside perspective. My fiancé and I usually don't have major disagreements, but this incident has left us both upset and I'm not sure if I was in the wrong.For as long as I've known him, my fiancé has had this pair of boots. They're old, really old. He's had them for ages and wears them everywhere – and I mean everywhere, from hiking trails to formal events. I've always found it a bit odd, especially at events where everyone else is dressed up or at least shows some kind of thoughtfulness to their appearance. He insists that they're high-quality boots, the kind that can be rebuilt over and over, and he's quite attached to them. He often talks about how much money he spent on them years ago and how they're meant to look aged and rugged.The thing is, to me, they just look... terrible. They're scuffed, discolored, and honestly a bit embarrassing in certain settings. So, I made a decision that I thought would be a nice surprise. I threw out the old boots and bought him a new pair, a sleek and stylish one that I thought would be more appropriate for a range of occasions. Mind you, he's only mentioned this once about the quality and how he can essentially re-use them or something like that. But he's also very frugal so I thought he just felt guilty spending which is why I decided to just step in and help him out.Well, the surprise didn't go as planned. When he found out, he was livid. He said that those old boots were special to him, that they looked as they should, etc. He accused me of not understanding the worth of well-made, lasting items. He's also quite upset about the new boots I bought, calling them \"cheap looking mall boots\" and saying they're nowhere near the quality of his old ones. I also accused him of not reading the room and noticing when his shoes are CLEARLY not appropriate and standout in the worst way possible.I feel terrible. I genuinely thought I was doing something nice for him, updating his wardrobe a bit and saving him the embarrassment of wearing those rugged old boots to nice places. But now I wonder if I've completely disregarded his feelings and attachment to those boots.So, AITA here? Was I wrong to throw away his old crusty boots and replace them with something I thought was better? I thought I was being thoughtful, but his reaction has made me doubt my actions.EDIT: It's clear the consensus is IATA. I spoke to my fiance again it is only now that he told me they were a pair of boots that were custom made to his feet sizing. I looked up the company and the prices are so absurd I almost cried. I asked him why he never ever brought up that he had a custom pair of boots! I imagine no one has something like that or at least very few people that it's something worth mentioning! I just have to admit I was wrong and that's it, I cannot even come close to affording a new pair of those same boots for him.",

I sent her the link to the one I wanted. She curtly told me no because she already had my gifts picked out. I asked her if she could buy the vacuum as a gift for my dad instead then, since a new vacuum would be perfect for our house.She became even ruder and said she was not giving my dad a vacuum for Christmas and had his gift already. She got heated, I stayed polite. I was pretty upset at the rude responses but fair enough- I bought my dad the vacuum myself as a gift.When we opened our gifts. Delia had gotten me a bunch of stuff from some holy sites she went to on a trip abroad (I’m Catholic) and some headphones. It wasn’t exactly what I’d wanted, but it was nice. I thanked her.I gave Dad the vacuum and he obviously liked it.  Delia gave Dad some custom pins. He oohed and ahhed more than he did for my gift.

To be polite, I smiled and told her I’d look into it, but that I really wanted to give this one to my mom since I already have more.

Delia made a dramatic proclamation that she’s “tired of [my] rudeness around gifts” and doesn’t want to give me any more. I think maybe I could’ve handled it better, but Delia knew what I wanted, could afford it, and instead got me something I didn’t need.

I have never gotten along with my SIL, 25F, she is always trying to put me down and is overall not the kindest. I met my husband through her when I was 20 and she's been kind of distant since then. While her and I were friends I shared a lot about my insecurities. I used to be 300 pounds and was very insecure about it. I went on a weight loss journey but she always felt the need to compete with me but she wasn't able to lose the weight. If I worked out for an hour she had worked out for 2 or, if I chose something healthy on the menu she would laugh at me. Despite us drifting this hasn't really gone away. I have lost some weight and am at a healthy weight now. It's important to note I only lost weight for health reasons and not appearance reasons, despite this, I think losing weight has made men more attracted to me(not that this is important). I am now thinner than her, she is chubby but not fat like I was.Of course she was at my wedding, she was a bridesmaid and her and I were actually getting along well and there were few issues. She was actually super supportive during the whole process. The ceremony was gorgeous and I wouldn't hesitate to call it the best day of my life. During the reception the cake came out and everyone was having it and I noticed that she wasn't. I could see her eyeing me as I ate cake. I had 2 slices and by the time I was on my second slice I could feel her eyes. I felt like she was judging me for eating cake after my weight loss. I think she is jealous because I was able to lose weight and she wasn't. I was tipsy and decided to confront her. I asked her what her problem was and why she isn't eating the cake. She seemed offended but didn't say anything. This upset me more and I lost it, I told her she thinks she's a good person when she's really not. I also accused her of being in love with my husband. She left in tears and the rest of the night was tainted from the interaction. My maid of honor texted me and told me I way overreacted and some other guests shared her sentiment.

I asked she was going to go on a diet and lose weight . Now I do admit that sounded a bit rude and bitter  from my tone but I was just concerned about her and these big companies . Everybody looked at me with shocked eyes .I quickly apologised for my tone and if she took it the wrong way but I told her I was just concerned for her because companies are becoming so strict with beauty standards and I just didn't want her to be disappointed if she go rejected and gets taken by a small companies where she won't make much money and won't be able to build herself a career .She responded by saying that I knew nothing about modeling society and how its changed over the years were now plus sized people can now model . I proceeded to tell her that I had many models even plus size models coming to me to ask for diets for them to go on to keep in shape and I told her as a dietician I definitely wouldn't mind helping her out because she was even bigger than a average plus size .She called me so mean and that I was so unsupportive of her . I told her that I was because I atleast pointed out the truth meanwhile everyone sat there knowing very well that your to overweight and still clapped hands for you. I told her if she wanted to become an actual model she would need to go on diets that even plus size models take and she can't even do that to a point were she might waste a whole lots of time instead of finding something that suits her and is a full time job.Everyone in the table said I was so jealous of her and I should apologise.

This wasn’t a matter of my wife being not attractive, just that her sister has a resume and career build on being attractive. My wife’s family is hot. My wife is gorgeous. However, her sister was a literal Victoria secret model in 2010. And that’s just not something us normal people can compete with in all honestly. And, it just kinda came up incredibly inconveniently…So my (M36) wife’s (F28) family (parents, sister, brother in law, and their newborn) stayed with us over the holidays. We switch off every year, and sometimes we even have both our family’s together which is awesome since everyone surprisingly has so much fun.This NYE, I will concede got a bit out of hand. I personally had a few too many shots and cocktails, but it was New Year’s Eve and everyone was celebrating and having a good time. I certainly wasn’t the only person slurring my words of the end of the night. Anyway, after midnight the adults were gathered around playing some sort of funny new game my wife found at target, my wife literally sitting on my lap. We had all been having a great time, my brother-in-law giving me shit and teasing me all night , me trying as best I can to keep up with his wit. The room always full of laughter. That sort of vibe.Well it all came to a crashing halt when my MIL picked up a card “hottest person in the room” and it was my turn to answer. Immediately, I  answered her sisters name but It was obvious to the whole room what an honest answer would be. I love my wife and think she’s so hot, but I don’t think it’s fair to hold her beauty In competition with a VS model. Which just happens to be her sister, sitting directly across from me. Yes, maybe I shouldn’t have been so honest but I was drunk and we’d all been saying crazy stuff and joking around all night I guess it just felt safe? My wife has barely looked at me since and won’t let me try to apologize and explain my perspective and validate that I think she is literally a goddess in my eyes. None of her family seemed to be overly bothered by it besides an awkward laugh, but everyone can feel things are tense between me and wifey.Okay be honest, AITA?",

I woke up a bit late like at 12 P.M. I got a notification on my phone about my RING camera. I checked it and a pacakged had been delivered. I hadn’t ordered anything in a while so I wasn’t sure what it was. I went downstairs and I got the package and it was a box with the word WEVERSE scattered all over it. When I checked the address it seemed to be right. I, of course, have no idea what a WEVERSE is so I opened it up. I found 3 KPop albums inside. It had a cover of what I guess to be a sun, flames and the word “HEAT”. I opened up the album because it looked cool. It has a bunch of little cardboard posters? I don’t know what to call them. It had a CD, a photo, and now that I searched it up I know they’re called photocards.Fast-forward to yesterday. My friend came over, I hadn’t told her about my little surprise package. First thing she asked me was “Have you gotten any packages?” What a strange question. I answered no. I wanted to see where this would go. She got all nervous and she honestly looked like she was about to start crying. She told me that she had ordered some stuff and had it all sent to MY house. I blew up. What right did SHE have sending stuff to MY house. I was yelling at her about it. She of course said “So you got the mail?! Why didn’t you tell me?!” Was it MY responsibility to take care of HER package that she hadn’t been keeping track off. I wouldn’t have mind if she told me about it beforehand. I know that where she lives it’s very busy and there are many thieves around. But to just not tell me about this. For all I know there could’ve been a bomb in there.She told me I was bein illogical and that I was the thief for taking her package. She then proceeded to SEARCH my WHOLE house just to find the KPop albums. Once she found them she yelled at me some more and then stormed out and left. I mean, I see why she’s mad. In her eyes I basically just stole something that belonged to her. I just don’t think she had to wait to tell me. After, she texted me saying that she was gonna contact a lawyer and sue me for “stealing” a package that was on my doorstep. She said that if I just dropped it then it wouldn’t be as bad. She also told me that if I just told her that I got her package. Problem is, it didn’t have her name on it. She’s stopped messaging me at all. I don’t think I’m overreacting, in fact I think she is.

We made the decision to wait to tell our families until Christmas 2023 as a dun Christmas surprise.When we went to see my mom, I was prepared for her to say something about it because she thinks we are rushing into things too quickly and she is a bit of a helicopter mom. When we told her, her reaction was exactly that. She did say she was happy for us but told us we should hold off on the wedding for a couple years (i.e. 2026 or later) to make sure we want to get married. We both just brushed it off and our plan is still to get married in October of 2024.We told the rest of my close family/friends and so far everyone else has been really happy for us besides my grandmother (mom's mom). My grandma reacted the same way as my mom but has told us multiple times that she is happy for us and has welcomed my fiance with open arms so I'm not too worried.Currently the problem is that every time I even mention the wedding (and sometimes when I don't) my mom has to bring up that we should wait to get married. She doesn't even listen to me when I tell her that my fiance is the love of my life/soulmate and neither my fiance or I can think of a way that we wouldn't be together.It got to the point where I was physically sick with emotion because one of the things I dreamed about was going to wedding boutiques and doing wedding stuff with my mom. Like that's what mom's usually do when their child is getting married. I also have distanced myself from really doing anything to plan for the wedding which my fiance understands but we are on a bit of a time crunch so we are a bit behind on things.I am to the point where I am currently ignoring calls/texts from my mom because I don't want to hear her thoughts about the wedding. I have also decided to tell her that if she doesn’t want to support my fiance and I getting married and will just keep commenting on it that she will be uninvited from the wedding and I don't really want her to be apart of my life anymore.AITA for deciding to tell my mom this?Edit: I forgot to add that I don't have a very strong relationship with my mom because she doesn't understand that I'm non-binary and that I don't like guys.Edit 2: I read a lot of comments about concern for marrying young and that a parent should be worried about their child marrying young. I guess part of my family (my dad's side, including myself) is used to it because a lot of the family married young on that side. I did ask my dad what he thought about it and he said as long as we have the money to pay for wedding costs go for it but if we don't then we should wait.

I hate it, it makes me feel like they want me to be a silent accessory because every time they approach me its about my appearance or its insulting my friends.

She said if I keep messing with the room temperatures than she will leave. I told her that me shutting the heat off so that I can be comfortable for awhile before going to sleep (when the heat is on) isn't a big deal and it's selfish of her to think I should be in constant discomfort.

I asked her to hand over the remote so they could use it, which upset her. She said that she wanted to watch TV and my son and his friends can wait and said they can go to his room to play. I told her to be nice and I only wanted to accommodate the guests. She handed me the remote and walked in her room. I told her she can watch TV in my room but she refused. This happend Sunday. Yesterday, I gave her the remote and apologized about her not being able to watch TV Yesterday but she said that she's okay and that she'll simply wait til Saturday until she's able to get her a new remote and that she doesn't want to get in the way of my son's play time. I told her that I didn't mean to upset her and that I only tried to accommodate her brother because he had friends over. I feel like my daughter is mad at me and I should have just told my son to play in his room. My son saying she's being petty but I'm not sure.

Our parents have been helping with cleaning their house, organizing rides to treatment, going over to cook for them, etc. I wasn’t really sure what I could do that they aren’t already but I told them if I could fill in somehow then to let me know.My sister reached out in our family chat today and mentioned they needed some groceries. Our parents are out of town so I said I could pick them up for her. She sent me a list and I said I’d drop it off this evening. It was a list of about 20-items. I didn’t pay attention to how many things were on her list until I got to the store. I was also doing my grocery shopping at the same time. Both lists wound up being WAY more than I planned on spending. I did not get about 10 items from my sister’s list that didn’t seem like essentials.When I got to her house she asked if the store was out of things. I told her the truth and she seemed miffed. After we got the groceries put away she said she didn’t understand my point because she had sent me money via an app to cover the groceries. I did not know this until she said something about it.She asked if I could go back since I had the money and started guilt tripping me about their situation. I still needed to get home to put my own groceries away, so I told her I could just send her half of her money back and she can get it delivered or something.A while later she texted me and said “they” were hurt (I don’t think this is true because her husband didn’t say anything while I was there) and she said she wouldn’t be asking me for help anymore. I said she’s being demanding and people have been more than kind to her, so she should be thankful, not critical. We argued back and forth and she insists I am in the wrong.AITA?",

	"body" : "Me and my fiance are having a destination wedding in Bali next week. We got engaged at the start of 2022 and started wedding planning almost immediately. We lived in Melbourne and all of our closest friends and family were people from there. At the end of 2022 my fiance got an unexpected job offer in Perth that was really good money so we moved over. By the time we settled, we had already booked our dream venue and sorted guest accomodation.We didn't know many people in Perth so the people we became friends with were mostly my fiance's colleagues and their partners. I became especially close with three ladies, Jane, Melisa, and Kate. In the meantime, I received notice from a few of my invited guests that they would not be able to make it, so the cards fell perfectly for me to invite my three friends and their partners. They were all really looking forward to it and told me they would attend.Guest accomodation needed to be confirmed 6 weeks in advance, and final numbers for the actual ceremony/reception 4 weeks in advance.Around 12 weeks before the wedding I found out that Kate was pregnant. She had told me previously she would come, but she hadn't formally RSVPd while Jane and Melisa had. I asked her if she was still attending and she told me that she was still suffering from morning sickness despite being halfway through her pregnancy, so she would let me know closer to our wedding date to see if she was feeling better by then.In the meantime, my fiance had become really close to one of his colleagues, John, and wanted to invite him and his partner. We didn't have anymore space at the guest accom but they were happy to sort out their own accom so they could attend.About a week before the RSVP date Kate was supposed to fly back home to spend the holidays with her family. However, her sickness was still really bad so she opted to stay and spend the holidays here instead. That was a much shorter flight then it would be to Bali so if she couldn't handle that, I doubted she would be able to attend our wedding. So I made the decision to offer John and his partner their guest accom so they wouldn't have to pay for their own.I told Kate what I was going to do and wished her all the best with her health and her pregnancy, and told her that if she was feeling better closer to the day she could still attend the wedding, and that we could even cut the RSVP time to two weeks before the date, but they would have to sort their own accom. She was very upset and told me how rude it was to make the decision for her before the RSVP date, and that even if she couldn't make it her partner would have gone.I get where she is coming from, but it was quite obvious that she wouldn't have been well enough to come, and she all but confirmed that in our last conversation. My fiance isn't that close to her partner so it makes more sense for him to have John there instead if Kate couldn't come, since he was much closer to him. So AITA?",

	"body" : "I (36f) am thinking of adopting a pet (a dog or a cat) even though my husband (42M) doesn’t want one. I’ve been thinking about this for awhile, like the last 15 years.Context: en I was growing up my family had a cat, and then when I was a little older we got a dog. And I loved them dearly. I’ve always wanted to adopt a dog or cat on my own, but wasn’t really ready for the responsibility during college. And then after graduating I moved out of the US for a few years so I didn’t adopt while abroad.Luckily during this time I was living with Roommates who usually did have pets and I loved it - while not mine, being around animals was always so much fun.Anyways I also met my (now) husband while I was abroad, and I was always open with him about wanting to have a pet. My husband does not share that feeling. He did not grow up with pets, and while he’s lived with pets and is not allergic. This is starting to become an issue now. We’ve been together for 11 years, married for 7 and have 2 young kids. When we  moved back to the US (like 9 years ago) we had a really small apartment in a big city. We got engaged (around the same time) and he said he’d be okay getting a pet once we had a bigger place. Well after a few years we got a bigger place with a yard and a fence. So I started talking about getting a pet. He said he’d prefer a dog to a cat, but that getting one would be irresponsible as we were both working full time in the office and wouldn’t be spend enough time with the dog who’d be home all day alone. Fair. I waited. Then we both started to have more flexible schedules and I got a remote job that let me work from home. I ask again about getting a dog, and he said ‘okay, you can get a dog, but just know if you do my quality of life will be extremely negatively impacted if you do.’So at the time I was like - a little dramatic maybe, but I’m not going to do something that would cause you so much harm. But kind of always felt like the ball was in my court. That was about 5 years ago.Since then we’ve had our two kids (4&1) and we moved out of the city to a really outdoorsy place with loads of trails. I’ve taken a new higher paying WFH role that way less of a demand on my schedule with a bump in pay and I’m thinking of adopting a pet again. I brought it up with my husband recently and he immediately said absolutely not. No discussion. Just pure annoyance at the thought.But he now travels a lot for work while I’m with the kids (when they’re not at daycare) by myself a lot of the week. I’m at a place where I can take pretty much all the responsibility on.Plus I feel like we had come to an agreement when we we got engaged about getting a pet but the goalposts kept changing and now we’re here.I guess I’m finding I care less about how his quality of life will be impacted and more about my own wants. And that’s what it is - a want, I don’t need a pet but I’ve waited a long time and feel like I’m done waiting.",

I agreed, and we were getting drunker and drunker until I finally was starting to not remember certain pieces of the evening. Well, at the end of the game, I remember Dave's wife calling me an Uber home. She forbade any of us from driving in our condition.I got home and it was a struggle to even stand up.

I told her that she was being way too rough on me and reminded her that it could be worse. I could have driven myself home, but she seemed to give me no credit at all for that. At this point, I was feeling sick to my stomach, and I vomited several times in the toilet. She blamed me for keeping her awake listening to me throwing up, but I reminded her that I left the door closed and that she has a whit noise machine on her nightstand.

John messaged my husband and their friends a few months ago to let them know that he and Maria would be visiting for the holidays and thinking about moving here, so we planned to have a gift exchange with my friends and my husband's friends (including John and Maria).We did all this on Christmas day, but about a week before Christmas we attended a welcome home party for John, where I met Maria for the first time. I had a neutral feeling towards her. I don't dislike her, I just think we are very different people and have nothing to talk about or bond over. She did seem to think she was better than everyone though (at one point someone made a comment about her engagement ring and John said that it didn't contain diamonds/stones that were mined because Maria wanted something that was more sustainable and better for the environment??? which seemed a bit braggy).The day of the gift exchange we all opened the secret Santa gifts first, and then we opened our gifts from our partners. When it was Maria's turn, she opened John's gift which was a few books wrapped in some newspaper and string, and a journal. I didn't really think much of it at first but then as she was looking all of the books I noticed that a lot of them had bent spines and covers, and looked to be old/used which was a bit off-putting since I know John makes good money.When one of my friends took her turn after Maria, I joked: \"I hope your gift isn't also  someone else's sloppy-second hand-me-downs!\" My joke kinda bombed and everyone went quiet and looked at me and Maria. Maria kinda tried to hide the books, but John spoke up and said that he only bought used books because Maria only buys used books and again brought up how it's supposedly better for the environment and more \"sustainable\". At this point, I kinda doubled down because I was embarrassed that everyone was looking at me like I had just murdered a puppy, but the mood quickly soured and John and Maria left shortly after that without even waiting for the rest of us to open our gifts.Now everyone is upset with me and saying that I was being rude and unwelcoming and that Maria is really nice and didn't deserve that. My husband wants me to apologize but I'm not sure if I should since I obviously didn't and couldn't have known that Maria wanted used items and it was supposed to be a funny joke.EDIT: Okay, I get it.

Therefore, I've required Will to visit a barber each month and to shave regularly if he still wants to get an allowance each month, I've also told him that he needs to buy new, more formal attire for occasions when that kind of dress will be inappropriate. May has been told she can't wear make up at school, nor can she use it too heavily whilst at home. I've made her aware that clothes that are too revealing have to be put away for when she's younger, and that I'll take her shopping for new clothes to replace themI've also required them to set themselves a goal for the future, as their only aspiration right now is to say that they are going to become models. They have to be either studying towards a career or getting an apprenticeship. This will apply to May once she does her GCSEs.Nowell agrees with all these rules, but my step kids have been saying that they are too restrictive and acting out against them. May will regularly argue with me about the dress code and the make up, and Will always backs her up. One of my mom friends said that it's an asshole move to enforce rules on them as they are almost 18 anyway.",

My wife is 18 weeks pregnant and understandably needs to use the bathroom frequently at night, and she’s opted to use ours instead of the guest one because ours is closer and she’s able to fall back to sleep quicker after.But I’ve been having trouble sleeping because of the noise of her using our bedroom’s bathroom, so I asked her if she could use the guest bathroom instead of ours. She got upset at me for even asking and told me it’s too far to walk and it would disrupt her sleep even more. She asked me why I would want to make her life harder at the minute, but I told her I didn’t really think it was a huge ask. We  went back and forth about it and eventually she just said she’s going to use our bathroom and she doesn’t care if my sleep gets interrupted because of it. I told her that was fine but I’m going to sleep in the guest room instead so I can actually sleep without being woken up multiple times. I just think it’s a pretty small thing to ask of her and I don’t see why both our sleep should be interrupted because of her.",

	"body" : "For Christmas this year, my dad gave me a yearly subscription to my local newspaper.  This is an award-winning publication, and it often features really interesting stories that I hadn't read because they were behind a paywall.  I was very pleased to have received the gift.  The thing is, I work full-time and need to start my day early, so I don't really have the time to read the paper deeply during the work week.  It's on Saturdays and Sundays that I can dedicate as much time as I want to it.Well, earlier this morning, my wife and I were sitting in our living room, and she was in the mood to talk over our morning coffee.  Normally, this is fine, though she does tend to ramble on and on about stuff I don't always care about, but today it was getting pretty annoying.  Furthermore, she seemed oblivious that my one or two-word answers to her questions meant that I was trying to read and didn't really want to talk in that moment.  Finally, during one of her interruptions, I turned to her and said \"Can't you see that I'm trying to read the paper?\"She became offended and sort of got a surprised look on her face, but that quickly turned to anger.  She tried to guilt-trip me and tell me that \"we never catch up anymore,\" but I reminded her that I am home every night after work, even though some days I work late/get caught in traffic.  At one time, I worked a job that required extensive travel, where I would be gone for weeks at a time, so I don't think she has any room to complain about my current work situation.  Nonetheless, she wanted to make this difficult by refusing to let me read.At this point, my wife is still upset with me, and I don't know what to do.  I'm considering locking myself in an empty room for a few hours because this seems to be the only way she won't disturb me, but even then I could see how she would knock on the door every 10-15 minutes.  I just need her to understand that what she's doing is making my Christmas gift essentially worthless, but she doesn't seem to have any respect for my father's money at all.  I wish she would apologize, but she clearly believes that I'm the one in the wrong.  AITA?",

He’s been very mean making comments about how this is the fifth foreigner she’s been engaged to etc.He asked my sister if she planned on leaving at the time that she told CBP she was leaving, and the time her passport says she must leave.She said no.

Her fiance came and picked her up, and they’ve lived together since.My husband and I talked about it and he claims that her doing this casts a lot of suspicion on to our relationship and risks my naturalization.

A screaming fight breaks out between brother and parent 1. Things end with him not feeling safe in his own home and looking for a way out (same for parent 1). If he goes to parent 2's house he gets in a different cycle of bs only to inevitably go back to parent 1. I am the only other person my brother has left to turn to.

I probably should've taken no for an answer but I felt backed into a corner.My brother seems super calm with us and of course asks if staying long term and taking up the one empty room we have would be ok.

After her date she came home overly excited and all she could talk about was Sam.  I told her that quite frankly I'm surprised this he wanted to go out with her and I question his motives. She asked me why I would say that and I was honest with her, most boys at her age are immature and aren't really looking for anything long term, they just want to take advantage or are going through a phase or are answering a \"dare\" from a friend to date the nerd, etc.She blew up at me after that and accused me of calling her a nerd and saying that I think she's ugly and not worthy of a boyfriend. I told her that's nonsense, that's not what I meant. I said I'm just trying to set expectations, not to expect much at her age, I don't want her to be disappointed and come crying to me about how this boy broke up with her.

	"body" : "Every year my (19F) mom goes all out for Christmas. I mean, it’s extreme. We have three trees and our whole house is filled with Christmas stuff. She works in a very demanding industry (music) and December is the only time of the year that is really “slow” with her office being closed the last two weeks of the year, so she goes nuts baking and decorating and basically pretending to be a 50s housewife since it’s the only time she really can.We did have nice birthdays and when we got older she would take us to musical festivals, but they were always genres I really didn’t like, but I guess it was fun going backstage.Every year we also do a “Christmas craft” on Christmas Eve. We have done it since me and my brother (16M) were little. Things like doing gingerbread houses or making ornaments.This year is my first year away at college. I still live in the same city as my parents, but I wanted some independence so I decided to live near campus. My parents supported this and do cover my tuition and rent. My friends were not going home for Christmas so they decided to throw a party on Christmas Eve. I told my mom I wanted to go to the party instead of coming over Christmas Eve. She sounded bummed, but I told her I was getting too old for her Christmas obsession anyway and wanted to do my own thing. I went to the party and had a ton of fun with my friends.I went to my parents house for Christmas day. I admit I was a bit later than I said I would be because I was hung over, but I still went. I asked my family what they ended up doing for the Christmas Eve craft and I found out they made wreaths out of a bunch of my mom’s ornaments as well as vintage ones she went around to thrift shops to find. I was upset. My mom keeps the craft a surprise and if I had known it would be a special one I may have shown up! I asked my mom why she didn’t tell me and she said “You know it's always a surprise.” Since she had already bought the supplies for me to make one before I decided to go to the party, my mom ended up making two. I asked her if I could have one of the ones she made and I would keep it up in my apartment all year. She said no because she “likes hers and wants to keep them.”I also noticed she didn’t put up my Christmas stocking with everyone else's. I had the gifts I would normally get, but the stocking was put away. I asked why and she said “I thought you were too old for my Christmas obsession.”I got upset and told her all this Christmas shit annoys everyone and she is being petty. My brother and dad said not to speak for them because they like doing the Christmas craft every year with my mom and like all her decorations. I told my brother that maybe once he grew up some he would also want some independence and not want to waste his Christmas Eve gluing shit.Christmas was awkward of course, and I ended up leaving before NYE. My brother still says I’m being an asshole, but I think he’s just sucking up to mom, so AITA?",

My long term boyfriend (M32) and I live together in Southern Connecticut, about an hour drive from the airport during off-peak hours.My flight out of JFK was at 6 am Saturday morning, and I wanted to get there a few hours early, so ideally leaving our house around 3 am. I had made it known from the beginning that I would appreciate if my bf would drive me to the airport. This was just a natural expectation I had, as I’ve always had family members drop me off or pick me up at airports my whole life. It was just what you do. My bf however considered this to be a huge ask. On his side of the family, there is a very high level of caution when it comes to driving, and that a drive to JFK is something you just don’t do, it’s expected that you just take public transportation or call a car service. My bf himself also has a decent amount of anxiety when it comes to driving. My point was that, we would be driving at a very quiet hour, it would give us some extra time together before I leave, and also it’s just not that bad of a drive! He said ok, and that he would drive me, then on the evening of said he didn’t think he could handle it and called me an Uber.During my week away, my bf had considered that maybe he was overreacting about the drive (I had told him how empty the highway was during my Uber trip), and said that he would pick my up at JFK when I came home. As the day closer, I could tell he was getting more hesitant about the drive again, and I was getting anxious that he would back out again. He kept hinting at not wanting to do it and said he had begun to feel back pain after a night at the casino with friends. Fast forward to the evening of my flight back East and I get the call that my bf will no longer be picking me up at JFK.I was with my family in this moment and was visibly upset and disappointed. As I said, everyone in my family just drives each other to the airport so they were genuinely confused as to why I hadn’t been driven to the airport to begin with and I won’t be getting picked up a the airport on my way back. My sister was so upset that I was upset and decided to talk to my boyfriend herself and convinced him to pick me up.So my bf did end up picking me up at JFK after my flight back. He was however very stressed and continued to express that he and all of his family and friends thought it was absolutely crazy that I expected him to drive the hour from southern CT to JFK to pick me up.Am I the asshole for expecting rides to and from JFK from my bf?",

Now, on to the story.So, my cousin got married a bit over a year ago. For the first dance, the band played a song that has a title (for the sake of simplicity, we'll call the song \"Zoe\") that rhymes with my cousin's name (who we'll call Chloe), so they used her name in place of the song's actual title. I don't want to say the actual names, since I can't think of any other names that rhyme with the two, and I don't want anyone figuring out who this is about on the off-chance someone else here was at that wedding.Anyway, as soon as the band said they were replacing \"Zoe\" with \"Chloe\", I had to put on my poker face because I knew the song was about something...kinda bad. In short, it's about alcoholism and committing crime. To the casual listener, it's hard to notice due to the upbeat nature of the song, it's when you actually look at the lyrics you realise what it's about. (I will not be confirming or denying if anyone figures out the song, so don't ask).Anyway, I didn't say anything at the wedding, because I know damn well what a bad idea it is to ruin a bride's big day.

The only issue is, they get super touchy with each other. Even in front of other people. I’m personally really grossed out by PDA and touchiness in public and they both know that too but sometimes they have issues with it. Yesterday we hung out and got lunch together and of course the whole time they were holding hands. Then when they finished my sister leaned her head against him. Then when we walked outside he literally KISSED HER FOREHEAD in front of me. It just felt so gross and disgusting to watch I actually gagged in my mouth a little bit.Then even at home he kissed her forehead more or she leaned her head on his shoulder and I just had enough of it so I left. Later that day I texted my sister trying to set a boundary, asking if they could keep the PDA and touching to a minimum while I was with them since it makes me really uncomfortable to watch. She laugh reacted the message and basically ignored everything I said and asked what PDA. I mentioned the hand holding and the cuddling and the kiss outside the restaurant. She acted confused and said it wasn’t PDA to cuddle with her husband in her own house. I said when I’m there it is definitely public and it makes me feel like I have to chaperone them or else they’re gonna get handsy or something. She said I was being stupid and that she wasn’t going to not hold hands with her husband just to make me comfortable in front of them. So not only is she doing all of this but she’s ignoring my boundary now.I said fine I just won’t come over anymore, expecting her to realize she could lose our relationship over this. She sent a shrug emoji and said “then don’t come over”. Now I feel ignored on top of everything. I talked to my parents hoping they could talk to her or help.

He had always been a very quiet person, to the point where he would barely talk to you, but I figured he was just being bashful. We celebrated with a graduation party held at his Dad's place, and I remember thinking that things were looking up for him.Well, at Christmas dinner, my father-in-law revealed to me that he works a low-level retail job at Walmart because he has \"crippling social anxiety\" and no employer will hire him, since he refuses to talk during interviews. I couldn't believe it. Computer science is a very in-demand degree, so you have to really try not to get a job in that field. I suggested that perhaps he should learn how to speak, since he's 22 years old, and laughed, but his father grew very defensive and told me that his son had \"been through hell\" and that my comments were rude.In hindsight, I admit that I probably should not have responded, but I felt incredibly insulted when my FIL called me rude.  I told him that my BIL's problems were entirely self-inflicted and then joked \"He didn't need a college degree to work at Walmart. Pretty sure he could've been a dropout to do that.\" At this point, the entire table was looking at me, and my wife even kicked me under the table. I had only stated the facts, and if his father knew that he utterly refused to talk to people, then it was a complete waste of money to send him to college. I'm sure he secretly regrets doing so, but can't bring himself to admit it.My mother suggested that we drop that topic and move onto something else, which I was more than happy to do. The mistreatment that I had received merely for expressing an opinion really soured my mood and left a bad taste in my mouth. It was as though everyone there felt that they could gang up on and discredit me, even when I knew in my heart that what I had said was correct. I've been trying to get my wife to see my point of view since yesterday, but every time I try giving her pointers on what her brother should do to improve his chances of getting hired, I get dismissed. I'm sick and tired of everyone treating me as if I'm some sort of illogical nut. I work a six-figure job, so I know what I'm talking about. I just find her whole family exhausting sometimes. AITA?",

I’ve pushed him many times to try and get a family doctor, but he’s “always too busy”. I’ve contacted doctor offices to ask if they were taking patients and tried to do it on his behalf, but I couldn’t.

Both of us are now no longer practicing but our parents and majority of the extended family are still devout Christians. This explains why Julian married his now Ex wife, Nora (27F) when they were 19 especially since she was also a very conservative Christian woman. Needless to say it was mostly due to both of their  parents pressure for them to marry at such a young age. They ended about 2 years ago and left on good terms. They both work at the same company but the office is quite large and they work in different departments so it’s not a problem.About a month ago, Julian confessed that he was bi and had known since he was 14. Apparently he experimented in high school secretly but was too scared to let anyone know. He said he was going through a lot at the time and could not handle the stress of figuring out himself and so he just repressed it and basically gaslit himself into thinking he was straight. It wasn’t until recently that he met someone (his now bf) that he finally took the time to work through his identity and be happy with himself.I love my brother no matter what and will always be there for him and this does not change anything between us. Our family taking this news badly was to be expected but apparently our parents let it spill to Nora’s parents (they are still friends btw) and she found out from there. She reacted horribly. She said she felt violated and disgusted that a “sinner” and “homosexual” had been intimate with her and that if she had know they would never have been married. She ended up outing him to her co-workers and in about 24h the entire office knew.This past weekend, Julian called me crying about this issue and looked to vent about it. I let him know that she was 100% wrong for outing her but I thought that even though what she said about him was unkind she had a right to feel that way. Julian was upset by this, hung up saying “thought out of everyone in the family you would be the one to stand by me” and hasn’t spoken to me since.

On Friday morning, I took responsibility for the misunderstanding but still asked to go because they'd offered on Tuesday, plans didn't conflict, and seeing my girlfriend meant a lot to me (I rarely got to, and this was my last chance for a while). When they refused without an explanation, I was frustrated and videoed to record what they were saying (in case they denied it later).Summary:I understand that my parents have the legal right to prevent me from driving, whenever they want. However, I think it was inconsiderate and unfair of them to deny me this time, as they wouldn't provide a reason and they didn't care that my girlfriend's family had to go out of their way for nothing. I didn't get to see my girlfriend, and I'm writing this from my college dorm. So, AITA?EDIT:Many people are concerned about me videoing, which I appreciate the feedback on. For more context, my parents have recorded me during past arguments; I didn't realize this was a big deal. Also, they have done hurtful things to me, pretending it never happened, so I wanted evidence.",

	"body" : "For context, I (36M) am currently in my second year of law school in the UK. I just recently finished up exams, so for the past few weeks, I have obviously been working my arse off and was under quite a lot of stress.I’m living at my brother (42M) and his wife’s (41F) house, with their 4 year old daughter (we’ll call her Emily). My brother and his wife both work full time jobs, so it can be a struggle for them to find time in the day to spend with Emily. Up until November, they’d had a full-time nanny/caretaker for her, but the caretaker recently had a child herself, and is currently on some sort of maternity-leave.My brother decided to reach out to our cousin (17F. We’ll call her Hannah), who lives in America— to see if she would be interested in coming to nanny Emily for the next few months, and in exchange for this she would be given free food, a room to sleep in, and get to experience life in a different country. She agreed, and has now been living here caring for Emily since the end of November.Hannah is very mature for her age, and when I have free time, we often cook, talk, and spend time together. We’ve grown quite close. Recently however, Hannah has not been as talkative and outgoing when speaking to me. Rather than spending her free time hanging out with me like she usually does, she’s been locking herself in her room more, and withdrawing herself from everyone.I finally confronted her a few days ago and asked her if something was wrong, to which she only said that she was tired? I didn’t really believe her, so I continued to keep asking her for the next few days. Yesterday though, she changed her answer about being “tired” and told me that she’s been feeling stressed recently. I asked her why she was stressed, as her schedule is easy (just feeding and spending time with Emily), so she doesn’t have any reason to feel stressed. She couldn’t give me a straight answer though, and just kept saying that she didn’t know why she was feeling so stressed, which literally makes no sense?? She even said that she “couldn’t fall asleep” anymore because she was constantly feeling anxious.I told her that she’s obviously never felt real stress then, and that she needs to grow up. She’s obviously never experienced ACTUAL anxiety, and I told her that if she wants to experience it, then she should try attending law school and it would humble her real quickly.Today, Hannah’s mum called me and told me that Hannah had called her last night, distraught, and is now begging to go home to America. She accused me of bullying her daughter, and said that what I had told Hannah yesterday was too far, which is fucking ridiculous. She’s mad that I told Hannah that she has no reason to be stressed?Hannah is flying back to the states in a few days now, and my brother is upset with me because he has to hire a nanny now. Frankly, I don’t see how what I said was too far, and it’s upsetting to me that everyone is turning against me for something so minuscule. AITA???",

There's just one discussion of ours that keeps lingering in my mind and coming back in arguments.Kasper smoked (we live in the Netherlands, so you know what type of smoking). I Don't smoke, never have, and i don't want to be with someone that smokes. From our second date I've let him know that i don't like it, but i couldn't do anything about it as we weren't even official yet. A few months into our relationship i told him that i don't  want him to smoke regularly, as it's unhealthy, and something bad always happens. It was going back and forth, i did some research and noticed it was not allowed in our religion either. After me stating that it's my preference and him stating that it's a part of him, i said that i just don't wanna be with someone that needs to smoke to have more fun. After some discussing, he agreed.He broke our agreement, as he kept smoking. After an argument he promised to fully stop smoking. About a month later, that dumb*ss sent me a video of him, petting a cat, and forgetting that he had a big roll of  in his hand. I found out that he has been lying to me all the time about this and he had been smoking. Long story short, after a lot of making up, he has now stopped completely (i believe).Now for the issue, he doesn't like the way i dress. I have a certain style, and it's really not that bad i believe. I don't wear crop tops with mini skirts all the time or go out with inappropriate chlothes. He doesn't like me showing any skin or wearing tight chlothes like leggings. F.e. i was wearing a hoodie and flarepants, and he thought it was too much (the pants).Thing is, on our first date, he told me my outfit was perfect, not too revealing but also not too covered up (in his words). It was summer and i was wearing flare pants and a tank top. He also asked me at the start of our relationship, if i would want to cover up more if we were meeting his family. He said you can dress how you want to dress normally, but his family is a little conservative so for a good impression, dress a little modestly. I agreed and understood because my family is the same way. When he asked me to be his girlfriend i was wearing a bright, tight red dress.For all these reasons, i think he gave me the impression that he was okay with how i dress. I didn't give him that impression with smoking though. He thinks i should make a sacrifice too, but I think this is not necessary as I'm not even really wearing skimpy clothes ( in my opinion). Or am i maybe the asshole because i stopped him from smoking, but i don't make a sacrifice in return?",

I've told him I don't like hearing in depth stories about his ex and if anything it makes me feel iffy about him. He has definitely worked on this since we had that talk until today. We stopped by my moms house as we passed by her street today. She was baby sitting my 5m ond niece and my boyfriend met her for the first time.  I genuinely feel like my niece is the cutest baby alive and he knows I ADORE HER. I talk about her all the time, buy her cute things when I go to the store etc. As we got in the car to leave I asked \"so what did you think of my baby.\" He laughed. I expected a response like \"She's cute but our babies would be cuter\" or something else cheesy. I asked \"what's so funny?\" He responded \"oh its nothing. It doesn't involve us at all?\" I looked at him in confusion for about 5 seconds when he says \"that's the ugliest baby I ever seen.\" That was about 30 minutes ago. I gave him the silent treatment the whole ride home and told him I am going to sleep at home tonight instead of at his place. He tried cheering me up by kissing me, telling me jokes, etc. He apologized several times but I don't know how to move forward. Am I wrong for being upset? What would you do in my situation? For clarity,  yes I am upset that he called her ugly because the baby is FAR from ugly. The actual issue is that he actually said it despite knowing how rude comments like that are.",

Neither of the two father's of her children are in the picture, one is in prison and the other has sadly passed away. So she shares the holidays with her extended in laws and this was their year.When my step mum found out Sophie was going to be alone, she extended an invite to Sophie as well. She was worried Sophie would feel alone in her house with the 4 children making noise. Sophie gladly accepted and was excited to attend. Sophie and my step mum get on really well, they have done since I introduced Sophie to them. They have gotten closer since we announced that Sophie is pregnant. Dad isn't Sophie's biggest fan. He wasn't happy I brought a white woman home.On Christmas Day, just as we were about to leave Sophie's my dad called and told me that Sophie was no longer invited. He told me that I should still come as my son and daughter (both teens) were about to arrive and I should come and see them. I told him that if Sophie wasn't welcomed and then neither was I.  He tried arguing that I should still go for the sake of my kids and I told him no and hung up. Ever since my dad has been sending me messages saying that I ruined Christmas and I let down my kids yet again. I had messaged them (they don't answer calls) to let them know what had happened and they chose to go to my dad's because that's where their presents were. Sophie is feeling bad that it's because of her that my dad is angry. Step mum has messaged her telling Sophie it's not her fault but Sophie still feels like it's her fault.

I'm taking them both out to the football this evening, which is our tradition. My daughter is a keen footballer while my son supports the team we're going to watch. I used to not be very involved in their lives until 5 years ago. I now see them regularly and am actively involved. They just don't answer calls, even from their mother. Neither of them like talking on the phone and would rather text. Video calls happen occasionally.Edit: I'm not able to post comments due to some mode being active. To answer some questions, Sophie and I have been together for 18 months. The pregnancy was unplanned, a combination of a birth control not working, and a condom split. We were being careful as we'd both said we were done having anymore children. Id been having problems getting my GP to refer me for a vasectomy,  im now on the waiting list.

Normally I wouldn't make a post for a minor awkward moment that only happened once.However, it has now happened a second time, a couple weeks after the first incident. Same situation, except this time after Liam was done he told me I needed to knock on the door before entering, and asked me what sort of place I was raised in where I wasn't taught to knock first before trying the handle.The reason I am not in a habit of knocking is because I assume that if the door has a working lock, then people will use it, and so attempting to open the door is the test of whether or not someone is currently using the bathroom.I've started knocking now, but it seems entirely pointless given the fact that the bathroom door has a lock that has worked perfectly every time I've used it (so, every time I need to use the bathroom). If I can remember to lock the damn door before unzipping my pants I don't see any reason why Liam can't either. It's not a finicky or complex lock either, it's a knob you turn 90 degrees. Knocking shouldn't be necessary if the door has a functional lock like that, but according to Liam I should knock every time regardless, and the fact I don't is cause for shouting. AITA?Edit for clarity (please read!): The door is always closed whether or not anyone is in the bathroom because the hallway is too narrow to easily walk around it when it's ajar.

As you may know, even when it’s winter, Florida doesn’t really get cold. My girlfriend wanted to go into a Starbucks to get a drink, and I also wanted one, so I left the window open so Marvel could get some fresh air and wouldn’t get too hot. However, I maybe left it a little too open because when we returned 10 minutes later, our cat was gone. My girlfriend started freaking out, asking why I left the window open, and she thought I closed it. She started panicking and I apologized profusely. I told her it was 76 degrees outside and I didn’t want the cat to overheat. She walked away and started looking under the car, in trash cans, wherever she could. We asked three nearby stores in front of our car, including Starbucks, if we could see their CCTV to see which direction Marvel went. They either said they didn’t have any facing the parking lot, or they would not allow us to see it. We thought about calling the police, but she said they would be no use. We drove around for the rest of the day and couldn’t find him. We had him for 3 months, and my girlfriend was the one who adopted him, and I completely understand why she is devastated. She spent the night in tears, and I felt awful. When we woke up at our hotel, getting ready to depart our now ruined vacation, she told me that she was very seriously thinking about leaving me.

I sort of laughed to myself, but she got up and walked over to my father-in-law and barely acknowledged me for the rest of the evening. I found it incredibly childish that she decided to punish me for her obvious mental inadequacies.When I tried bringing up the subject later, she still somehow tried to pin the blame on me, even though she kept deciding to forget this information time and again. I told her that it's annoying for me to keep answering the same questions over and over again, but she totally refused to see my point. She just kept going on and on about how I had \"belittled\" her and how I needed to apologize. If anyone is due an apology, it's me, and I can't help but find the absurdity of her position humorous. Today, she barely kissed me before heading off to work, and it's pretty clear that she is unable to admit that she's in the wrong, even for one second. She didn't used to be this big of an egomaniac, and I'm starting to question what I can do to help her learn appropriate behavior. I'm feeling pretty defeated. AITA?",

I am not upset about the 30 dollars i was upset on how it was handled(verbal assault).

I adore them, I have a good relationship with the younger two, the eldest (Damon) is still rather awkward around me. I'd say that I am their main carer, as Mar is paid enough at work to allow me to stay at home and focus on my art, and their mother, Christine, is always busy with shifts at her two jobs. It's gotten to the point that the youngest, Alma (F2), calls me 'daddy.'I have very solid beliefs, such as the belief that meat is unethical. I don't want anyone to bring meat into my house, when I got into a relationship with Mar, he became vegetarian. As a result, when the kids are here, the meals I cook for them contain no meat. Damon had no problem with it up until now, he complains at every given opportunity about the lack of meat. I've explained to him that eating meat is non-negotiable, he can eat it at his mother's. His father backed me up. I've tried to compromise by buying him 'beyond meat', but he still insists on actual meat.Another thing is that my husband is very affectionate to me and the kids, although Damon being 15 is embarrassed by that. The younger two always climb onto our laps for hugs, and Alma always wants to be carried around on my hip.I don't speak to Christine much, we're not on very good terms as she has been homophobic to me in the past and critical of my former job, so I was surprised when she wanted to speak to me when I dropped her kids off at her home. She demanded that I don't 'push' vegetarianism on her kids, to allow them to eat meat in our home, to which I told her that I don't dictate what food she cooks in her house, so she shouldn't do so to me. She also stated she was uncomfortable with Alma calling me 'daddy' and the affection I show to her kids.Asides from being vegetarian, I tried to respect her wishes and discourage Alma from calling me 'daddy' and I stopped letting her and river climb onto my lap or hug me. That didn't work out very well and I was left to deal with 2 confused and upset little kids to comfort, therefore I decided to go against their mother's wishes and let them carry on doing what they're used to. I feel conflicted because their mother's wishes have been disrespected, but at the same time, I'm just doing what's best for the kids, not what's best for her.edit ; idk why everyone assumes Damon is outright banned from meat, he does eat meat when he goes out with his father or his friends. shit, I even pay for it when he goes out to eat. the smell of meat nauseates me for a variety of reasons2nd edit : whoever the fuck is sending me messages making fun of my dead child, you are bottom feeders.",

When they walk in her direction, she physically jolts. When they are walking around the house, she focuses on them the entire time to make sure they don't go near her.I love cats and want to get one. She has known about this since early in our relationship. The most my girlfriend will compromise is she said the cat has to be restricted to one room or a balcony. To me this is inhumane and unreasonable.My view is that my girlfriend's fear of cats is irrational and she needs to confront it and work on it. I'm not saying she has to like them, but her fear is extreme and irrational and she needs to get to the point where she can go about her day without being terrified of them.I'm going to get a cat anyway and ask her to work on her fear.

He was very shocked and said stuff like “you know I don’t like him”, “you ruined my birthday”, “why did you do this to me”Then he actually left the party and went home. I tried calling him multiple times but he didn’t pick up. The party was pretty much ruined then.

Both my parents and my wife’s mother are very conservative Christians, and they look forward to our messages every year. While they’re all very good people, they have some odd, very antiquated takes on fashion that really don’t mesh well with my daughter’s “live and let live” attitude. Also, we have been lying to our parents for years now and telling them that Eri remains a devout Christian, although she is now an atheist and she’s left the church way back when she was 19. I and my wife still pray that our daughter will come back to God soon.So anyway, this year Eri came back home on the 20th, for Christmas celebrations (she left on the 22nd to visit her boyfriend in Boston) and to record our yearly video msg. For all our previous msgs, my daughter had dressed up in non-descript attire and she basically looked the way her grandparents wanted her to look. Nice and simple. But when she came home this year, I was somewhat disappointed to see that she had dyed her hair auburn/brownish (her natural hair color is black), and she had on a leather jacket that was opened up, pretty low-cut at the chest. Also, she had on some mascara. Her grandparents are so old-fashioned that although this kind of stuff is just normal for 2023, they wouldn’t have approved of it. The end result is that Eri sat out from our video, and although the night was supposed to be festive and celebratory, she just spent it pouting like a little girl. She refused to hug me and her mother and outright told us that she’s glad that she’s spending the holidays on the opposite coast of the country with her boyfriend. I got petty and I just told her that her mother and I are glad too.Are my wife and I the assholes for not wanting to upset our parents? Take into account that my wife’s mother is 94 and my mom is 98 and dad turned 100 this November. Those were some different times back then, when they grew up.EDIT: I don't know what it was like for my mother-in-law, but I feel like, at least for my parents, their conservatism can be understood if you knew what my great-grandparents were like. The stories mom and dad have of them.....my wife and I, as well as our siblings, have tried our best to break this tradition of overbearing-ness and uptight-ness, although we all voluntarily carry on the tradition of our faith in God (well, all of us, except for Eri).",

The older kids got a board game and the little ones were given stuffed toys. A little bit after MILs step-children showed up with one of their grown kids and a huge dog. MIL immediately started fussing over the dog calling it grammies boy and saying how handsome it was. Then she asks hubby to grab a bag from under the tree. It was full of gifts for the dog and MIL had us all sit around while she helped the DOG open its gifts. The DOG got a total of six gifts including treats, toys, and a bandana. Looking around MILs house this dog's face has pretty much taken over. She's got it on everything including ornaments, mugs, calender, a blanket... She's got more pictures of the dog than her actual children or grandkids.On top of that, she offered her family recipes to the daughter of her step-child right in front of us. She said she'd pass down her Christmas baked goods for her to make because she trusts her since she's such a good baker. Then started bragging to us about the things this woman has made. Hubby and his siblings grew up on these recipes. The step-kids didn't. Plus seems like she might have skipped a generation there.When everyone was leaving she gave her actual grandkids a quick hug and love you each then fussed over the dog a bunch telling him she loved him then she hugs the step-kids daughter and says \"love you so much, my sweet girl\"!!!WIBTA if I said something? It all just seems so disrespectfulETA: The step-kids did not grow up with MIL or her family which is why we aren't close with them. They hated MIL and their bio dad until shortly before his death then suddenly formed a relationship that got them willed the house hubby grew up in to \"make up for lost time\". Ever since FIL passed MIL has been absolutely taken with step-kids and constantly brags about them and their families to her kids. It's hard to get a word in on any other topic. She make it clear to her kids who she likes best and now is doing the same to grandkids. It just seems very manipulative. And yes we have asked for the recipes and were told \"someone\" will get the honor before she dies. It's family tradition that MIL would bake a goody tin for each household every Christmas and it's always been one person to have the recipe. Apparently she intends that tradition to continue with step-grandchild and mentioned it in front of us unprompted once again letting her kids know they've fallen out of favor.ETA2: I honestly didn't think it needed to be said but I'm not jealous of the dog.  I'm just seeing the same manipulation she uses on hubby and his siblings now directed toward my kids. If you aren't in her favor she has no use for you and let's you know it. It just seems doubly disrespectful that she's using a dog as the shining example to get grammies love.

Recently I have noticed my sister displaying symptoms of autism that my parents maybe haven't picked up on. She has severe noise sensitivity and when there are loud noises she often covers her ears and in some cases cries. Another thing is she is extremely picky about the way clothes fit and is they have ruffles or are too tight she won't were them because she doesn't like the feeling, she is also sensitive to certain textures such as polystyrene as well as her not understanding when me or my dad make a sarcastic joke she takes it seriously and doesn't understand sarcasm. My best friend (M17) also had autism which is diagnosed not highly affecting but he also has these symptoms. I did some research and all these are symptoms of mild autism. I brought this up with my sister asking her what she thought and she wasn't sure, the subject slipped out in conversation with my dad and now my parents are mad telling me that it's not my business and I should not have told her this as she is now confused and upset (maybe she was a bit confused but she didn't seem upset).

Meanwhile, my husband (33M), a software engineer, has been working from home for the past three years. But here's the thing: his work habits are a bit... unusual, and I'm starting to feel overwhelmed.During the day, I often see him pacing around the house, deeply engrossed in his thoughts, sometimes even muttering to himself. When he's not pacing, he's in his office, shooting hoops with this mini basketball net. But it's not the relaxed, fun break you'd imagine. He looks tense, almost as if he's forcing himself to take these breaks, not really enjoying them.Yesterday, after a particularly tough day (the baby was extra clingy and the 5-year-old had a meltdown over a lost toy), I reached my limit. I asked my husband if he could pitch in more during his workday. \"Maybe hold the baby while I make lunch, or play with our eldest so I can catch a break,\" I suggested, pointing out that his breaks could be opportunities to lend a hand.His response threw me off. He explained that his job isn't like a typical 9-5 gig. Those moments of pacing and playing basketball are him working through software problems in his head. He insisted that even though he's physically present, he's still on the clock, mentally working out bugs or feature designs.I get that his job is demanding and mentally taxing, but I can't shake off the feeling of frustration. Here I am, juggling two kids and a home, while he's right there, seemingly available yet mentally elsewhere.We ended up having a bit of an argument where I expressed how exhausting my days are, and he reiterated his need for mental focus during work hours. He does help out in the evenings and weekends, but weekdays are pretty much all on me.So, AITA for expecting him to contribute more during his work hours, despite understanding the mental demands of his job? I'm trying to be empathetic, but with a baby that needs constant care and a 5-year-old who's a bundle of energy, I feel like I'm barely keeping my head above water.",

He seems cool. While they play games (on speaker), I frequently engage in conversation with the two of them while they are playing, although I do not play games with them.He has not said anything explicitly wrong on the stream that I've heard.Here is my issue. I am from southern-Ontario Canada. He is from some American USA place. The subject of racism came up, and the unacceptability of white people's tolerance of racism (we are all white). In the process of the conversation, he revealed that one of his best friends IRL from childhood is a virulent racist, and uses the N-word regularly, in a hateful and derogatory way against Black people. But he still regularly communicates and hangs out with this person (one assumes, in whites-only social engagements). I find this to be totally unacceptable.To me, this would be a deal-breaker. If someone I was associated with would use the N-word or say something abusively racist, I would break that link.... Like I would immediately walk out of a restaurant and leave him behind, level of disconnect.So although \"Seth\" seems like a nice enough guy, I'm worried he's one degree of separation from basically a neo-nazi. In my home we do not believe white people are inherently superior... Both my wife and I are strongly anti-fascist and anti-nazi, and neither of us would tolerate friends that have that persuasion. But \"Seth\" is not like that, except he is friend-of-a-friend from that attitude, and although he says he does not \"agree,\" he clearly sees no problem with it.Would I be the asshole if I insisted she not talk to Seth while I am present? We live in a small home, and this would basically have the effect of totally cutting her off from an online friend. And I want her to socialize and have friends. But what kind of an influence is this...edit I say both \"wife\" and \"girlfriend,\" we aren't legally married but we have been living together for ten years.

I noticed they all had a tight tubular \"mask\" on over their nose and mouth, like a thick sock. It looked pretty uncomfortable for them.My uncle explained that the owners had put \"spit masks\" / \"spit socks\" on all the alpacas before our arrival and it was a common thing, and something he requested all clients to do before an alpaca shearing.The goal is to deter them from spitting (since the spit will backfire) and to make sure you don't get spit on.Well, I didn't think that was a very good justification for something like that. It looked stifling and uncomfortable for them, and the only benefit is avoiding spit?During a break I checked on my phone and it said the only big problem with alpaca spit is that it can stink, it's not like it's harmful or anything. And they seemed well-behaved anyways. I was willing to risk a bit of spit to make the alpacas more comfortable.So while my uncle was shearing, I removed the spit-mask from a couple of alpacas without him noticing. When he noticed, he got really angry and said \"put those back on, what are you doing, do you want to be spit on?\"I said I wasn't too worried about it and I wanted what was best for the alpacas. He said \"you have no clue what you're talking about, put them back on now.\"I didn't see what the big deal was and said if anything it'd be me that got spat on from it, not him. He said \"I'm the one who has to drive you home, do you have any idea what that will be like if it spits on you?\"I didn't do it again but I feel like he was overreacting and it was sort of contentious the rest of the time. We didn't talk much on the ride home and I get the feeling he won't be inviting me to further farm days.It feels petty to me for him to be so worked up about me risking getting spit on (probably not even him) as if I couldn't clean up before driving home, I don't see what the big deal is.

She is German, new in town and doesn’t have many friends and I am moving to Germany in spring, so we have hung out a bit. I told her about my NYE party and invited her to come. She said it sounded fun and that she would be there. We didn't discuss timings etc. That night she left at about 1am, she had eaten a couple of mushrooms (legal here) and had a couple of beers. The party continued until 5am and got wild. I realised she would not like the vibe of my big NYE, so I just dropped it.We met up on 28th December and neither of us mentioned NYE. I thought that was the end of it and she had already made other plans. She wrote me 3 general chatty messages (not asking for specific details about the party) on 29th and 31st December and I didn't reply.My party was great. We ate at my house, started the party here and went into town for the fireworks as planned. We saw her there, I hugged her and everything was fine. Yesterday she went to the sports club. I wasn’t there. She heard about my party from our mutual friends. In the evening she wrote me this message:\"I heard a bit about your NYE today and I'm hurt by how you treated me. I think you owe me an apology.When you invited me to join you and I said yes, I (obviously) thought I had plans for NYE. I only realised that I was no longer welcome at about 5pm. You should have told me you had changed your mind in time for me to make other plans. My German friends had already left for City A and it was too late for me to go to City B (the place she lived until August). I couldn't even join my housemates because they went somewhere that needed tickets and there were no more tickets left. I ended up spending the night with complete strangers. They were lovely and I had fun, but I'm hurt that strangers were nicer to me than you because (until then) I thought we were friends.It would not have taken you much time to tell me I should make other plans.

I hope that when you're in Germany, a long way from home and struggling to communicate and make new friends, that they are kinder to you than you were to me.\"I haven't replied. I think the message is way too much. She should have realised plans had changed when I didn't tell her the details, confirm with her if she was coming or even mention it to her on 28th.

She has a beautiful smile though, and she is a lovely and bubbly person, and a joy to be around. We both work on a holiday resort, and we live in a work allocated accommodation. Recently a new guy joined. He is very attractive. Perfect teeth, perfect skin, tall, mixed race, and built like a superhero. He’s a pretty cool guy, but you can tell he’s always been good looking because he’s pretty smug. But he isn’t like totally unbearable.This new guy has been put in the room next door to Anna.  And she understandably has a huge crush on him. He has been friendly with her, and they talk fairly often. She gives him rides to the gym and around town. But there are a few issues. One, the guy has a girlfriend, and she unsurprisingly also looks like a movie star. He talks about her quite often and he obviously likes her. Second issue is Anna reads into their every interaction way too much, and her friends hype her up. “Omg he hugged me and called me a legend when I offered to drive him to the gym” “omg he responded to my dm” etc etc.Her friends hype her up and tell her to go for it and are putting it in her head he might like her, even though, he definitely doesn’t but I tried to just ignore it. I tried to warn him about what was going on and while talking to him about Anna yesterday, he said “she’s such a lovely girl, it’s a shame she a dog”. And he then went onto say “I don’t think there is a single thing attractive about her”. That sort of spelt things out loud and clear.Earlier her friends were again hyping her up after he responded to another dm of hers, and she said she was going to ask him out (keep in mind she KNOWS he has a gf) and I felt so awful I had to stop it.  I told her she has no hope, ever, that he has a girlfriend who he realistically is never going to leave for her, and that her friends should be ashamed of themselves for feeding her delusions. I then said that he barely sees her as a friend and she should get real and drop her obsession before she gets hurt or humiliated. Anna teared up and ran out of the room, and one of her friends went after her. The rest of her friends started berating me and then also followed her.Thing is she was literally about to do it right there and I snapped into action. I feel I worded it harsher than I had to and am wondering if I should have just let her get rejected. AITA?",

I didn’t know her work online before we were introduced to each other, I respect that’s how she makes a living but I have no interest in becoming a public figure myself.There have been some occasions when we were out together and people came to her and ask for a picture; sometimes they ask for a selfie or ask me to take the picture for them, and I do it, sure. But yesterday we were out in a bar and I could see a woman at the next table next was staring at us, until she stated taking pictures of my gf and I with her phone. I was bothered because she didn’t even ask and I didn’t want to have my picture taken.So I turned around and asked her to please stop taking our picture. She was a bit embarrassed and said she wasn’t sure if my girlfriend was the person she was thinking, my girlfriend confirmed it and had a quick chat and a took a selfie with this woman. Later, my girlfriend told me in private that I shouldn’t have said anything because this wasn’t about me, and if I act rude with her fans or whatever, it reflects badly on her.I don’t understand how was I rude (I asked that lady politely), and I think I do have a say in the matter since I was sitting by her side and for all I know it was also my picture being taken.

	"body" : "My boyfriend (19M) and I (19F) were out with two of my own friends for an anime convention earlier on. Me, my friend and her boyfriend were all dressed in cosplay for the event as we enjoyed to cosplay during our free time together. After the event, my friend had suggested to take a simple photoshoot as it had been awhile since we’ve cosplayed together as a group. I agreed to it and my boyfriend was also okay with the idea so we headed out to a proper venue for a photoshoot.During the photoshoot , my friend’s boyfriend was trying out different ways to take our pictures. One of which was trying out the “Panorama” feature on his phone. I agreed to be the one he tries this method on and when we took a look at the results, we all bursted into a fit of laughter. It was genuinely a silly and innocent joke and I was in on laughing at how ridiculous I looked. The panorama had warped my image into looking like a default Roblox character.My boyfriend then asked if he could have the picture for himself on his phone. Initially, I thought it would be something he kept to himself as some sort of silly inside joke, so I agreed for it to be sent. I would have never agreed to it if what happened next didn’t occur at all.When it was my friend’s boyfriend turn to take pictures, I was standing next to my boyfriend when I saw my picture in a private chat with one of his own friends. At that time, I didn’t think to tell him what he did because I felt that it was funny, but after much thought, I did not like that he had shared images of me without my knowledge.After the day had ended, I decided to approach him with the situation and told him that I did not like how he was willing to act on sending pictures of me to his friends without my consent to which he responded with “I just thought it was funny”. I explained to him that I felt that it was not fair of him to be doing that as he himself had expressed how he would prefer if I consulted him on the pictures I post or send to others. I then asked him if he liked that I was passed around since he likes to do anything he pleases with my photos. He was taken aback and asked where the relation was and I explained to him again why I felt like he was breaching my trust for him.He apologised and said he wouldn’t do it again, but mentioned that I also did something like this a few days ago when I texted my friend that he was crying over a bad haircut he had. I had told him my intentions sending that message was not to ridicule him but to ask for advice instead as I was unsure on how to console him at that situation. He still believes what I did was as bad as what he did today and I can’t help but get hurt about it. AITAH?Edit: hey guys, I’ve realised what my mistakes were with regards to the situation and I’ve brought it up to my boyfriend with how I reacted. He mentions that none of it was with ill intentions and that he just wanted to share fond memories with his close friends about his own girlfriend. He understands about how he didn’t respect the boundaries set prior to the situation and he apologised for his actions. I’ve also told him how my behaviour was impulsive and I did not mean to warrant distaste for my perspectives of the situation. I apologised for my mistakes and I shared that I would love to communicate things better with him in the future.",

I am now studying creative media production in college and have been since September. I have 4 tutors on my course, one of which is an audio teacher who is hard of hearing. Yep, you read that right. A practically deaf audio teacher. You couldn't write this.Now my timetable is structured OK apart from one day, Monday. On this day I have a 3 hour session in the morning with a graphic design teacher who's lovely and energetic and gets everyone going on a Monday morning, I then have a 90 minute break until a one hour session with said deaf audio teacher. Now I went to this session every time I had it before Christmas, and I realised that this teacher doesn't actually teach anything new within the session, and given that when we ask him questions, he always comes right up to us given his lack of hearing, so it's altogether a really awkward session.Furthermore, the session is timed horribly as the end of the session is precisely when my bus back home leaves, so I have to wait a further hour or spend an extra £2.90 for a SINGLE to a place where I have to catch another bus which is always delayed due to school ending at the same time. So in the end, I decided the session is not worth going to. Not in the mind of the lecturer. He thinks that the hour is incredibly valuable (despite the fact that I can also do the work at home), and that if I persist in missing this particularly shitty 1-hour session, he will call my parents and tell them I have been missing loads of college which isn't the case as I attend all his other sessions (no matter how painful they are).

	"body" : "This was about a week ago. My husband and I are expecting our first baby in May. We have never been traditional and I don’t like big parties. Selfishly, I feel like we need to have the baby shower because babies need a lot and it’s all very expensive.Since we started talking about a baby shower, I had said I wanted it to be coed. I wanted my husband there with me because I’m uncomfortable being the center of attention and we made the baby together, there was no immaculate conception lol. We immediately got push back from older family members like my grandfather but that was somewhat expected. My mother, mother in law, sister, and sister in law are planning it and I am not involved in the planning. They are paying for it and dealing with the whole thing. Important other background- my husbands family is Italian and Sicilian and traditional Italian Catholic.I made a list of folks to invite to the baby shower that included family members and I tried to be as judicious as possible. A majority of those on the list were family (large Italian side) and the other majority were friends (primarily women and their SOs who are also friends). I immediately told my husband to back me up with the coed baby shower and address it with his mother which he did.Here’s where I might be the asshole. The four hosts got together to talk about planning and my sister texted me when they were all together and said “Can you just clarify why you want a coed baby shower?” I thought I had been clear, I thought my husband had been clear, and also at the very basic level- because that’s what the pregnant lady wants.I went off a bit. Told my sister I was very upset that this was even coming up because we had already told everyone involved that we wanted a coed baby shower. Said I would call to clarify if I needed to. I was extremely heightened and frustrated and upset that this was even a topic of conversation so when my sister called me to try to calm me down the first thing I said to her was that we should not be on the phone because I was not happy. She proceeded to tell me to calm down and that there was nothing wrong and that they were just trying to do a nice thing and that the list was getting long and it was going to be expensive. I essentially said I didn’t care, that we had never been traditional, and that this was a boon for my mother and mother in law because we had not involved them in planning the wedding (I hope for obvious reasons now) and I had not had a bridal shower. So I was trying to be nice and say here plan this for your grandchild and invite whoever you want as long as it’s coed.I ended up hanging up on my sister mid rant and texted her compromising and saying if the list was getting long then don’t invite the male family members. My husband told me I should have stuck to my guns but they are paying for it and I want to be conscientious of that at least.So Reddit, AITA for blowing up about a coed baby shower guest list?EDIT: I hear y’all and I did apologize to my mom and my sister. I have been dealing with perinatal depression and anxiety so it’s been hard to even address stuff with the pregnancy. I think I was already uncomfortable and felt cornered.

It's not an occasional issue - it's constant. And he just leaves it, shit smears collecting for months at a time. There's a separate toilet closer to my bedroom which I use exclusively now because that toilet is so gross (which I clean regularly). I refuse to clean his shit so that toilet just gets left to fester. The only shower is in the shared bathroom so just not going in there is not an option.I've spoken to him a few times about this but it seems like we have misunderstood each other as we just had another sit down conversation about it and I had to fully spell it out - after you poop, have a look to see if there's poop on the bowl and if so, wipe it up. He looked at me like I was crazy and said I was being ridiculous.Things got pretty tense and he demanded that I explain to him exactly what I expected of him - did I expect him to clean the entire bowl? Even down to the water line? Even if his hand would get wet? (I actually had to explain that I use the brush in this case). Do I expect him to wipe up every single speck of shit, every single time?I said I was willing to compromise - perhaps instead of every single time he could just commit to cleaning the toilet once per week instead. He insisted that no amount of compromise would leave him feeling better about it because he doesn't believe he should have to do it, so he would just do it exactly the way I want, but that he would move out at the end of the lease. This is probably for the best after this exchange, but the whole thing has left me absolutely reeling and wondering if my expectations are unrealistic. AITA?",

But if she chooses not to help out, then she should not expect me to do half the chores around the house. She says that her money is her money and my money is our money. So what does she want to do with her money you may ask? Spend it all on herself. Despite that, she wants me to come back home from work and still help her out with the house work.I explained to her that if we both go to work for 8 hrs, and there’s an hour drive there and back from work(2 hrs) then I’ve put in 10 hrs of work into this relationship since I’m paying 100% of the bills. Whereas even if she puts in 8 hrs of work, and 2 hrs of travelling time, she has put in 0 hrs of work into the relationship since that’s all money she’s making to spend on herself. And I also said that if there’s a lot of chores that need to be done, let’s say 4 hrs of chores total, now If you want to split that up, that’s 2 hrs of house work for me and 2 hrs for her. Meaning ive put in 12 hrs of work into the relationship, whereas she’s only put in 2.I just want to put a disclaimer that we were talking about daily chores as in cooking, and cleaning, and other stuff. I still don’t mind doing the traditionally manly chores like throwing out the trash, fixing things, building things, etc.It just seems very selfish to me that she wants to spend all of her money on herself and expects me to spend all of mine on the bills and her, then she wants me to do other daily house work too. I’ve also given her the choice for her to help out financially and then I can do 50% of the house work so she has that option, but she isn’t satisfied and wants the best of both worlds.

	"title" : "AITA For wanting to live in my boyfriend's house rent-free?",
	"body" : "obligatory throwaway account and english is not my first language.Fellow redditors, i'd like to hear your opinions on this issue.My boyfriend (M27) and I (F25) have been together for 3 years. I graduated from college recently and got a job, and my bf and I decided it was time to move in together. I currently live with my parents.After we discussed this, my bf informed me that I had to pay rent to live in his place. His house was a gift from his mother on his 18th birthday, so his only expenses are related to bills.I refused to have to pay rent, since the place is not rented or anything. I'd like to contribute with half the bills, house insurance and other expenses related to the house, but not rent.I suggested that he could rent the extra room if he wants to have the extra cash, but personally I would not be paying. My boyfriend thinks it's unreasonable for me to be living in someone's house rent-free, and doesn't want to rent the extra room due to privacy.Am I being an entitled asshole for wanting to live with him without paying rent?EDIT: just for clarification, he wanted me to pay rent plus half of the bills and house related expenses.UPDATE: since posting this, I've evaluated the pros and cons of moving in together, and decided that it's best for me to stay where I am until I'm more stable financially. Right now my main goal is to save as much money as possible, and living together would mean that 2/3 of my salary would be gone (not to account for unexpected expenses, like a new roof or a boiler as someone mentioned).I talked to my boyfriend about it, and told him I could not help him out with expenses in the way he thought was fair, so it was best to wait until I could. He was a little bit upset that I wasn't willing to put in any effort or sacrifice into our relationship, but I think he'll understand where I'm coming from eventually.Anyway, thank you all for your comments, it helped me a lot.",

I don’t have a lot to give but their stepdad left some lovely jewelry and a small rental property for me. I thought of splitting the jewelry between my girls but Ava would get the property and more money.Ava and her husband are already in such a well off financial situation while Jane and her husband are just doing OK.

Which meant her would leave early on Friday and come back late on Monday. Because of this I’ve been doing all the housework and cleaning etc.I should also mention that my mom has some health problems and that it’s either me or one of my siblings dropping her off at doctors appointments or picking up meds. Anyways fast forward to Monday and my boyfriend says he’s gonna stay with his family for one more day and come back around the evening on Tuesday. (which is today) I said sure no problem and went on with my day.Fast forward again to today at around noon he texts me and asks if I can cook dinner since he hasn’t had anything other then snacks and wanted something to eat when he gets home. I say okay again BUT I ended up forgetting. I know that it was kinda shitty of me but my day was kind of busy since I picked up my mom’s meds, cleaned most of the house and did groceries. By the time i was finished I was burnt out and ordered some food.So obviously when my boyfriend got home at around 6pm he was hungry and asked what I cooked, and that’s where I realized I messed up. I told him I completely forgot but there was some leftover food in the fridge from when I ordered it or I can make something quick. He didnt like these ideas and went on a little rant before going upstairs.I’m currently in the living room and I’m kinda wondering if it was an AH move to do or was I justified for forgetting.

	"body" : "I usually walked my dog to a park in my neighborhood in the evening. My dog is almost 6 years old. I have had her for a year now. She is a good rescued dog (Greyhound X) who is an owner pleaser and aloof to others (dogs and human), never want to be close to any of them. She is responsive to commands almost all the time. Evening walks have always been fine. Apart from one time, she was attacked by a territorial Mastif, but lucky she came out of it unscathed. Because she is reliably responsive, so I often walk her without lead when there's no one around. Whenever I see pedestrians, I always call her and she would come so that I can leach her.Until one evening, there was a middle-aged guy in an SUV who stopped his car and watched me playing fetch with her in the park. As soon as I noticed him, I changed the route on my way back. Yet, he followed us and slowly drove passed with window down. Then he drove back to told me while in his car that he has been patrolling the area because his dog was attcked by a white dog the other day. That dog was in critical condition with hefty vet's bill. He said I should put her on a lead. I showed my sympathy to him and his dog and I assured him that said that my dog is not aggressive kind and if anything she would just ran away. He drove off.Yesterday evening, my partner and I met a middle aged female pedestrian while we were out on another evening walk. She saw us called our dog back and leached her. When she's about to pass us, she said her dog was attacked by a white furry dog with face a bit like a Pug. Her dog is now fighting infections from an injury on her back leg. I told her I knew about the incident from a guy who I assumed to be her husband. Again, we showed our sympathies and said our dog was attacked in the same park, too. She told us to be careful and reminded us to put her on a lead. We said that she's not an aggressive dog and would run pass her like she's not even there.This evening, same walk to the same park. My dog ran up to the park before me. When I got to the park I noticed there was a lady walking in there. I didn't see anything suspicious as my dog was on the other side of the park and sort of waited for me to start playing fetch with her. I didn't want to go to that side of the park, so I called her over. As soon as she came back to me, the lady started shouting to me \"You should put her on the lead!\" I said \"No, she's alright!\" She repeated \"you really should put her on a lead.\" So I replied \"are you being a good citizen?\" She walked on, stopped at the edge of the park and looked at me playing fetch with my dog. I noticed that, so I walked toward her and asked \"is there a problem?\" She said \"you know by law you have to put your dog on a lead at all time.\" \"which law?\" I asked. She replied \"it's the shire's.\" I remember her from yesterday, so when we established that she's the same person, I said \"I know you are upset about your dog, but my dog isn't the one who attacked yours.\" She said \"your dog maybe good, but you never know. What if there were children in the park who don't know?\" It was nearly 7 pm and there was noone apart from her. I said \"you are clearly upset and this has nothing to do with it.\" She then said that she would report this to the Shire and request them to patrol the park. Let's end it here.Please judge me with your best ability. Am I the arsehole?",

I thanked her and said, \"Oh its risotto!\" as in i was surprised since she said she was making soup. She said, \"No its chicken soup.\" I then asked her where the broth was to make it soup, as the reason i was asking for soup was because i didnt want anything thick. She then starts getting upset because I was calling it risotto and not soup. My wife gets very hurt when I say anything about her food.

We've been together for two years, but this is the first time we've celebrated together. We both decided to exchange lists and we each got a couple things from the list to keep up with the \"surprise\" of it all.My girlfriend's list was very descriptive. A couple of the items were \"Nars foundation\" with her color, \"Lush bath bombs\", and \"Puma running shoes\". Just to name a few. I was happy to get her these things, but I didn't, and still don't, get the obsession with the brands.For Christmas, I did most of the shopping at Target for everyone, not just her. They didn't have a lot of the specific brands she wanted, but I got her what I found and what I thought she would like. I got her a bottle of foundation in her color, it was from the brand wet and wild. I got her a big bag of Dr. Teals bath bombs, which I know are a good brand since I use the salts often. I also got her a pair of running shoes. I can't remember the brand name, but they looked fine to me and we're in her size. I also got her a couple other things, but I just listed these to save time.On Christmas day, she seemed a bit confused opening the presents, but thanked me nonetheless. Later that night, she asked if I had trouble reading her handwriting or if I was confused about the list. I picked up on her talking about the brands and I just told her I don't think we should buy brands just for the name, rather the quality and price of their products. Since these products are cheaper, and she got more bang for her buck, like with the bath bombs, I didn't see an issue. The price I paid for a whole bag would have only gotten me one from the company she wanted me to buy from. She got a bit cold after that and said next year we just shouldn't do lists since I don't want to gift her what she wanted. We argued for a bit more, and more or less dropped the issue after a couple days. However, I'm still getting a comment or two from her and now I'm wondering if I was in the wrong.",

Right from the time he could talk, my mom started giving him whatever he wanted whenever he threw a tantrum. I put up with it at first, hoping the tantrums would stop, but things just got worse over time.No matter how much I tried to tell my parents, especially my mom, to stop babying him, it felt like they weren't listening. I even suggested she let him learn to eat with a spoon on his own when he was 4, but now, at 8, he still makes a huge mess when he eats – standing up, watching TV, and leaving rice all over the place. My mom complains, but nothing really changes.In 2019, my mom had another baby, my youngest brother, who's now 4. I tried my best to make sure he didn't end up like his older brother – While I wasn't perfect at teaching,  my youngest sibling is way more disciplined. He knows how to eat nicely, say sorry when he messes up, and take care of himself, unlike his older brother who still needs a lot of help.Now, let me tell you about this recent incident. My (8) M brother was building a pillow fort, taking up all the pillows, and I was cool with that – he's still a kid. But my youngest brother just wanted one pillow to lay on while watching something on my phone. I knocked on my bedroom door to grab something, and my brother got mad, saying, \"I’m not letting you in because I’m punishing you.\"Before all that happened, earlier I tried to explain that our youngest brother just wanted to play, but he wouldn't listen. He kept shouting, so I took our youngest brother out of the room. Later, I asked my brother to open the door, promising to take only one pillow. Instead, he threw a huge tantrum, yelling that I was \"destroying it.\" I promised to find another way to get the pillow without ruining his fort, but he kept shouting.Then, my mom showed up without even asking what happened, she started yelling at me to stop. So, I just focused on feeding my youngest brother his dinner that they brought. But instead of figuring out what went down, my mom told me to apologize. I found it ridiculous, and I laughed silently, wondering why I should say sorry when I didn't do anything wrong.My mom got even more upset, shouting, \"Just say you're sorry! How hard is that? Be reasonable.\" Feeling the pressure, I said sorry in a sarcastic way. She wasn't buying it and insisted on a real apology.

My parents invited me and my bf to spend the holidays over at their place, and we both agreed to go. My bf speaks his native language and English. My parents speak the language of our country and my dad speaks very fluent English while my mother’s English is not so great.While going to my parents’ place, I received messages from my high school friends to meet up. There’s four of us and we are a very close friend group from high school. We haven’t seen each other since onset of COVID since one of my friends was living in another city and we couldn’t all gather together. They wanted to get together while I am around my hometown and go grab dinner on one day. It was a day that I was free with nothing planned with my family/bf.Here is where I may have been an asshole. I was so eager to see my friends that I immediately said yes without consulting anyone. I checked with my parents and they were ok with cooking and taking care of my bf while I am away for a few hours to grab dinner with my friends. I then asked my bf, completely assuming that he’d be ok with it, but he immediately got very upset. He said that I was the one who brought him to my hometown to my parents’ place and it is rude for me to just ditch him to go meet up with my friends. He said that I should either not go, bring him along to the meet up, or he will head back to our home by himself. He said that I should prioritize important relationships (such as ours) over friends that I haven’t seen for years.In his culture, it is normal to bring significant others to see family/friends. But in my country, it is not common to see even the wife/husband of your friend. For example, in weddings, usually only the friends of the bride/groom is invited and not their spouses unless the spouse is also a friend. In this instance, where there is already an established circle of friends, it would be kind of rude to try and introduce someone new, even a bf, and I don’t want to trespass the boundaries of my friends. They also don’t speak English so communication would be a problem too.I tried to come up with compromises, like my parents having dinner with my bf (since they can communicate and we have visited before and they have a pretty good relationship) or we hangout around my meet up place and i can book a restaurant for him just for the time I am gone. But he doesn’t want that and he wants me to cancel the meeting or bring him along. I do feel bad about leaving him for the couple of hours and I understand that in his culture you would normally bring your SO to your friend gatherings.So i want to know if I am an asshole for not accommodating to what is normal in his culture and making him be alone to go see my friends for one night.EDIT: the part about bringing SO to see friends was worded badly and confused a lot of people so I edited it to make it more clear.",

Our condos are both 460 sq ft, so I don’t see how it would take several hours to clean a space just slightly bigger than an extended stay hotel room.Ever since then, she’s made it a point to be as obnoxious as possible at all hours of the day/night. I work full time, run a small business, and go to school part time. She will wait until she realizes I am home to start back up and is so loud now that I can hear her over noise-canceling headphones. The property management company has told me to call the police (part of their policy) when it becomes too much, but this is an almost everyday occurrence when she is home and I’m not about to call everyday for a noise disturbance as their resources are better used elsewhere. Property management has fined her, but it’s done nothing. The police have told her to quiet down, to which she will until they leave (she’ll watch out her window).She has also started spreading rumors that I bully her for being disabled, that I have physically threatened her, and my friends (who were here at the time helping me with my mental health) have no business being in my condo, while she’s allowed to have friends over. It’s getting to the point where I don’t enjoy coming home anymore. I just want to come home and be able to rest or do my homework in peace and quiet but I can’t. My landlord has tried to talk to her landlord and it does nothing, so WIBTA for suing her for emotional distress?Edit: I don’t have money to just up and move as some of you have suggested. If I sue, it will go through small claims as that’s how it works where I live, which require no lawyer.",

	"title" : "AITA for not wanting my (30F) partner (30M) to take a gun as a Christmas gift from his grandpa?",
	"body" : "Some background: I was raised without guns. I had never held a gun in my life until a couple of years ago. I am always nice to the grandpa, even though he's done some things to rub me the wrong way. I act interested in the things he shows me even if I'm not. Well one time he was showing me a gun and placed it in my hands. He didn't ask if I wanted to hold it (I would have said no) just handed it to me. When he saw how uncomfortable I was holding it he took it back and said he thought I would want to look at it. I told him that was the first time I had ever held a gun and it made me uncomfortable. My partner was raised with guns in mind, he was taught how to use them safely and taken to the gun range as a child.A few years ago my partner was pressured into taking his father's rifle. I wasn't happy about it and neither was he. He complained about it to me on multiple occasions and said he wished he hadn't taken it. However he never expressed this regret to his family.Well this Christmas his grandpa got him a gun as a present. My partner said he wouldn't take it home until he had a lock for it. On our drive home we talked about if he should take it at all. I told him ultimately it was his decision but that I thought he shouldn't. I talked about how he told me he wished he hadn't taken the rifle before and how big of a stressor it was to get rid of it. I told him he didn't have to feel guilty for not taking it and his grandpa should have known better than to buy someone a gun without discussing it with them. I compared it to buying someone a puppy as a present. My partner is very defensive of his grandpa and said he kind of wants to take it to make his grandpa happy. I said I think that is a bad reason to have a gun in your possession.Am I justified in being upset with his grandpa? Should I be more supportive of him taking a gun as a present? A big part of me is worried about setting this precedent. If my partner takes this gun, will his grandpa buy him more guns as gifts?Edit: just as a reference my partner and I are both vegetarian and he has only used a gun at a range.Edit 2: I do feel like I shouldn't be mad at grandpa now and it is up to my partner what he wants to do (which was my stance from the beginning). If he decides to take it, like I said that's his decision. If he doesn't then he needs to have that conversation with his grandpa. From the conversation I had with him he said he doesn't want the responsibility of owning the gun and is planning on telling the grandpa he won't take it.Edit 3: Just sat down with him and said \"you know you can take the gun if you want to right?\" and he said that he didn't want to because he would just put it in the closet and never use it and if he did want to use it he would have to run errands (buy ammo go to gun range etc) to be able to use it and he doesn't have time for that and doesn't want to make time for it. He said he'll try to figure out the right way to tell his grandpa.",

I asked him rhetorically who's he to give somebody a feedback, especially when he's not perfect. Plus what he pointed out could already be their insecurities so he shouldn't have.

Last November she got unexpectedly laid off from her very well paying job and has been having a hard time finding a new position. I make about 2/3 of what she used to make, but I said I would take care of our shared expenses (rent/utilities/groceries) until she found a new job. She had some savings but I told her to allocate those to her own expenses like her stupidly expensive car payment, insurance and whatever else she wants to spend it on.While she’s been at home she has taken the role of taking care of the house which I appreciate. She cooks my lunches, cleans, takes care of our 2 messy cats, goes to do the grocery shopping with my credit card, and I always come home from work with dinner ready to go. I never asked her to, but appreciate it nonetheless.One night she accidentally popped her last pair of rubber gloves with her nail and asked me to do the dishes. She usually keeps a stock of rubber gloves in case since sometimes I drop them in the sink and get the inside wet and she has to throw it out. For context, she has some sensory issue thing and will not touch dishwater/food in sink with her bare hands since she was like 15.I had a really rough day at work and just wanted to relax and play games, so I told her I would do them tomorrow but she said that I always say that and never do, and that she won’t go to bed with a sink full of dishes. Here’s where i might be the asshole; I told her to suck it up and just do it then, it’s just dishwater and it’s not gonna hurt her. I also said that it was her job now cus I was the one making money. She went quiet and just started to do the dishes, but I noticed that she looked really uncomfortable and washed her hands repeatedly afterwards so I felt kind of bad.AITA?",

I'm going to have a hard time changing moving forward, but I suspect it is because IATA and that is par for the course.Closing thoughts: many of you provided insightful views which I hadn't considered, but a ton of you guys are also AHs, lol.  Sounds like some commenters are dealing with some skeletons.  All in good fun, ty!!My wife and I were visiting her birth town (Midwest-USA, population 35k) when she was gifted a bracelet for xmas.  She told her mom that she would be exchanging it for a different bracelet that matches her watch color, and her mom was totally fine with that.On our way out of town, we stopped by the jeweler for the exchange but were told that they didnt have the desired metal available.  My wife requested a refund for her mother's credit card, but were told that the store policy requires a receipt for the transaction.The manager greeted my wife by name, knowing her from past Church involvement, and also personally knew her mother (old friends?).  She said that she was able to see the receipt in their system, having looked it up by credit card, but the store policy said that \"they needed a receipt”.  I asked if a picture of the receipt would be OK (have her mom text a photo), and she agreed that it would be fine.  I began to question the policy.  My wife, recognizing what I was up to, looked at me and said, \"Dont\".  I politely discarded her recommendation and asked the manager if I could walk through the logic so that I could better understand their policy.The manager obliged, so I stated the following:Manager personally knows my wife and her motherManager agrees that the item was purchased in that storeOur desire was for an exchange only, but we requested a refund only because of their inventory.The refund requested was for her mother's card which we had in our possessionA photo of the receipt was \"needed\", but I verified that there was no additional information on the receipt that was required to process a return in their systemSo what gives?The manager stated that everything I said was correct, but it was their store policy and she stood by stating \"it is a good policy\".  She added that they've had two incidents where meth heads returned gifts for cash without their parents knowledge.It seemed ridiculous that addicts would get jewelry and \"return\" it, but whatever, what do I know about the midwest?  I said \"Ok\", but was quick to point out that my wife was not on meth, and left it hanging there.  After only a minute or two, the manager said they could make an exception this one time.  I left the store as not to add any tension as the return was processed.My wife was NOT pleased.  She said that it's a small town and she was worried that it would make her parents uncomfortable when they found out what I did.  I merely pointed out the absurdity of a policy that seemed only designed to waste customers' time, and that the purpose of a manager was to evaluate information and make decisions, NOT hide behind a policy.Being from the NorthEast and completely OK with self-advocation, it left me wondering if I was a total asshole for advocating for my wife.  I know she didn't ask for the help, and even asked me NOT to engage in the conversation, but I just couldn't resist.. because fuck them.  AITA?",

My wife has explained to him that he has \"special eyes\" that can’t see red and green. This doesn’t quite sit right with me because his eyes are defective, not special. Obviously I don’t use the word defective around our son, but I just think it’s more accurate to acknowledge that his eyes function differently because he has a disability, rather than using terms like \"special eyes\".He confidently misidentifies colors a lot, and I correct him whenever he does. However, my wife told me me to stop correcting him because it will diminish his confidence and he doesn’t see the same things as us so no amount of correction is going to change what he sees. But I told her that correcting him is the best thing to do because it will help him learn what things are actually what color.I just think it’s beneficial to correct him and tell him how things are so that he has the same information most people have, but my wife disagrees and wants him to embrace his colorblindness.",

He is an amazing person - I am very grateful for him - I just genuinely need some objective help with this one.Normally I am also a slim and fit woman, but I have been feeling increasingly unwell and poorly for the last 7-12 months. I was getting a lot of pain in my abdomen and bad fatigue. I used to hit the gym 3/4 times a week but I was struggling to manage even one.I went for further investigation and it turns out I have an ovarian cyst which needs surgical removal (I’m going for this in two weeks) and possible endometriosis. I’m trying my best to eat healthy but walking is painful and even sitting is painful. I’m on naproxen which helps, but I stupidly ran up some stairs the other day and I nearly passed out from the pain at the top from twisting.As I’ve been struggling with moving for a few months I’ve not been doing really any exercise and walking the dog has been difficult. I’m trying to do my day to day activities but my nagging pain is just always there. I’m not much bigger than I was but I’m maybe 8-10 pounds heavier.My husband has been supportive and obviously understands I’m in pain and is relieved I’m getting treatment. He has continued to hit the gym almost every day and so is in amazing shape. I do compliment him daily and I know he looks amazing.But this morning as I was getting ready, he came in our room and started telling me how great he looked. How he had beaten the Christmas weight and felt amazing and god didn’t he look fantastic.I know I felt super insecure in that moment, so I said ‘you know I’m feeling really bad about myself at the moment and I’ve put on weight.’ And I think I said he hurt my feeling by almost rubbing it in my face a bit.He said he wasn’t doing that and why didn’t I want him to ‘celebrate his successes’. I said it wasn’t about that and I am happy for him and I do tell him he’s amazing and handsome and looks incredible but I’m just really not in a great place right now and I think maybe that should be considered by him.I now feel rotten and feel like I was putting him down. And I really am worried I’ve been the asshole here. But I want to be back to normal and not in pain and I just feel so much anxiety right now with my health. He doesn’t like to argue so we left everything fine, but I’m at work now and worrying.Appreciate peoples honest takes. Was I the asshole?Update: thank you guys for the great advice - I have called my husband today and apologised and communicated how insecure I’ve been feeling in myself. Thankfully he understood and I’m now heading home to make him dinner. Just can’t wait until I can get back to being myself again after my surgery!",

My bf (30m) hasn’t shown the slightest of interest in couples line dancing.

The instructor normally plays all the couples dances back to back and forth one of the dances I did not have a partner. I saw at the other end of the circle a guy was dancing by himself so I called him over to dance with me. My boyfriend’s whole demeanor changes from good to bad within seconds. I tried explaining that I had only called him over to dance because we were the only two people without a partner and I had already apologized to my boyfriend a million times. Fast forward to the next day my boyfriend had said it was disrespectful of me to dance with another guy (when again he doesn’t dance and has no intention of even learning). I then keep telling him I will teach him but again he takes no interest and blames me about not being adamant and showing him the couples dances. He is also blaming me If I were to dance with any of my friends who he knows and are guys it would’ve been ok but the guy I danced with at the bar that night I knew but my boyfriend didn’t. My boyfriend had spoken with his grandmother (who I have yet to meet) and she had said if he didn’t learn to dance he would lose me and those words couldn’t be more true. I don’t want a guy who isn’t even willing to slow dance let alone learn couples dances so this situation does not happen again. I feel like we are both at fault (me for being disrespectful and him for showing no interest in learning or even mentioning it when we see each other almost every weekend) So AITA for dancing with another guy I am friends with because he doesn’t want to learn the dances P.S. - He works every weekend 12 hour shifts at work so we barely see each other as it is and when we are together he either wants to relax or work on our trucks together over a friends house.

Even though I was in the clear it was very stressful to deal with.The current partner I have also had joined our university robotics team for a year but she never really made friends there and just did work like it was a job and quit the group after a year and I barely spoke to her there.AITA here, I really don't want to risk things. I understand the tasks may be mundane but it is a nightmare when people don't do things properly and then I have to take over near the deadline as they won't admit they are struggling from the beginning.",

My fiance, Alex, and I both have so many amazing friends and family who will celebrate with us, and everyone is really happy for us.When we were planning our wedding party, I had a list of friends I wanted to include, and so did Alex, and he wanted his brother to be his best man. I'm really close to my brother, James, he's a nice guy and he just got married this year, but I was looking at all of the groomsmen and people in his party and I realized James would just stick out in all of my photos. I love James, but he's on the heavier side, and he transitioned about ten years ago. I'm worried that if he's in the wedding party, he will take away the attention from me and my fiance, and that he won't fit in with any of my wedding party events. I don't know what the events will be yet, but it's just a concern. Alex and all his friends ski and James doesn't, stuff like that.James messaged me about a month ago asking if we had suit or color schemes to plan for if he was in the wedding party, because he and his wife, Erica, were booking fittings with tailors for outfits, and that's when I told him that he didn't need to match with the wedding party, because he's not in the wedding party. He asked if Erica was in the bridal party, and I said she wasn't either, but I told him that I wanted them to read something special at the ceremony for us, like a poem that means a lot to me and Alex.James has been really helpful with helping me with my wedding cake, dress fittings, and going over menu and venue options, and he's been really upbeat and positive about all of this so I was surprised when he got mad at me -- he asked if Alex's brother would be a groomsman and I said yes, and he said he was surprised and upset, and that it would be \"unconventional\" for one brother to be in the wedding party and the other not to be.I told him that I was sorry for how he was feeling and reiterated that we wanted to give him a special role by reading something that was special to us as a couple, but I really don't think I'm going to change my mind about the wedding party, it would just give it a different vibe and I think it would be more fun with just my friends and my BIL. But James still seems really upset and he hasn't responded to my text about the reading, but then he said that he wasn't going to help me more with planning elements, and I'm really stressed because I was really relying on his help. My mom thinks it's fine because my brother only had immediate family at his wedding, so there was no wedding party.AITA for wanting to have my friends in the wedding party, but still have James help me in a different role?",

Also I have no idea how the system regarding preschool works in the US, so sorry if it is hard to understand.I gave birth to my son this August. In my country you get about 1,5 years worth of days you can take out to be on parental leave, most people save some of these days so they can stay home occasionally with their child as they get older. I am planning on taking all of these days and stay home until my son is at least 4. Of course a lot of planning has gone into this, I know we can’t eat the most extravagant food, buy the newest clothes or take expensive trips. But to me, staying home and taking care of my son is worth it. Even though I am planning on having him home for this long, I know how important it is for a child’s development to be around other kids and people in general. So every Saturday I take him to an open preschool, don’t know if it exists in the US but basically, everyone is welcome there with their child for a few hours, they play, we eat and do stuff together. There is a mother there who had her daughter last April. She expressed to me and some other parents how sad and upset she was about having to go back to work so soon and that she was stressed about leaving her daughter at preschool. She said that she wishes that she could be able to stay home as long as I planned, I said that it was possible. She told me that for them it wasn’t. I called bullshit on that, she obviously gets her hair colored, has makeup, trendy clothes and stuff like that. I told her that if she just budgeted and not spend that much on herself, of course she could stay home. She once again said that even if she did, they could not afford to stay home any longer. I know she has a husband, so it has nothing to do with that. I scoffed and said that “life is what you makes it out to be”. She seemed extremely upset over this. Later one of the people who organizes this asked to talk to me, she explained that they value kindness and respect here, and that if I continue to make this a hostile place then I would get another warning before being banned.Was I really an ass for just telling her the truth even though it may have been a little hard?

My boss (56) will be called Donna, my employee (20) will be called Sarah, and my regional manager (probably mid 50’s)will be called Jenny. And I(Krystal) am 20.For the whole summer it was me and my boss at the salon and in the last week of September we hired Sarah. Donna worked with her for one day before she broke her foot. After that she was out till December 14th so it was just me and Sarah. Backstory on Sarah: she graduated cosmetology school when she graduated high school in 2021 this is 2023 and it’s her first salon job and so she has forgotten everything she learned.Anyway, after Donna was out I had to basically do the managers job and train Sarah. I personally don’t know all the things that I would’ve needed to train her in but I did my best with how young I am and the fact that I’m just an employee.The first two weeks I worked every day of the week because I would have to help Sarah because she can’t do fades. By the third week I was hoping she would do fine alone so I could recover from being burnt out and when I came back I was watching her and every fade she did I had to go and blend it better or basically do the whole thing. That’s when it started to bug me. The whole time she’s there she’s on her phone as well. Her whole time working here she took out the trash once. I took it out 4 times.And we are supposed to have a secret shopper come in and it’s an automatic fail if we are on our phones. By the time Donna is back I hate Sarah. In her first 2 months she took off 6 unscheduled days off leaving me alone on the busiest days which is Friday and Saturday. When Donna was back she wasn’t back full time. She has soft bone that is still healing so her foot is in a boot. Donna is gathering trash and I am cleaning up after a haircut and Sarah is just sitting in her chair on her phone and watching Donna gather trash. She does offer to help at all just watches.Then Donna asked her about 30 minutes before we close to fold the towels and capes. She was on her phone while she was doing them and only did half of them in 30 minutes she leaves right at 6. Never stayed to finish the job she started. I asked her in the morning why she didn’t finish them her excuse was it was my time to go. Then we all get in trouble for phones and it’s really only her. After that she’s still on it. She puts in her two weeks for “classes” which it was after she got told no for mopping in the morning and a week goes by and we leave her a note to take the trash out and it said “I expect you to take the trash out Krystal and I can’t be doing everything around here” signed Donna. Which I did write the note but after that she quit and didn’t finish her two weeks. The next day I find so much trash of hers that she had left for us to clean.

But here’s the thing, you need to revise all the presidents no matter the topic of the exam otherwise you’re going to fail.For example if the question is “was Reagan the most successful at delivering what he promised of all the presidents of the 20th century”  (the question we got, well that wasn’t exactly how it was worded can’t remember it but something like that) you need to list all the presidents and all the promises and achievements and compare them to Reagan.

Little private concert, free food and drinks, pics with the band (I literally stood right next to Logan aaaa), so it was a very cool experience.After the band leaves to start getting ready for the actual show, we were allowed to hang out in the private room, mingle, snack, etc. Some girls had taken the stools that the band had been sitting on when they performed and were taking pictures in front of the backdrop while sitting on the stools.I notice this and jokingly go \"you think we are worthy to sit where they sat?\", laughing to myself a bit.

I told him that it was a sticker one of my artist friends drew and it was mine so he shouldn't have thrown it away with out asking me first.

In January I had a problem with my eyes where I had to go to hospital for serious migraines and blurred vision, when I told my partner (25M) about this he came straight home from work to look after my daughter (his now step daughter) without me asking. Thankfully the doctors didn't find anything seriously wrong and I regained full sight.Now since this incident my Mil scolded me and berated me for my partner coming home to take care of me and my daughter (he's in the army). Just the prefix, I didn't ask him to come home and he done it anyway saying that \"we are family\".I had a follow up appointment at the opticians where my MIL just so happened to be there and this is where she first berated me in front of a load of strangers. Now I told my partner about this straight away and he was furious with his mother and told me that he would talk to her about it. However when he went to meet her, he didn't bring it up and she reiterated that i should have called my family as a priority.Since this incident there have been a few times where my MIL has excluded me from family gatherings and is asking for lore 1 on 1 time with her son without myself and my daughter present.There has been a recent incident where I had to tell my MIL for overstepping one of mine AND my daughters boundaries and I have expressed this to my partner but says he now doesn't want to get involved.My MIL is now blaming any negative mood on going through menopause and saying she's having really low moments which is one of the reasons my partner isn't talking to her about me and accepting her current behaviour with our family.AITA for now being cautious about bringing my daughter and future child (I am currently pregnant) around my MIL with her behaviour as she's been actively excluding me and my daughter out of family get together and overstepping boundaries that have been expressed multiple times and over crossed.My partner is now saying he will not get involved because he doesn't want to upset his mother and be \"piggy in the middle\" when I have told him how much its upset me.",

Our guinea pigs are still with my uusband parents due to last bits of construction still happening. Last night we got a call from my MIL that one of our gui ea pigs had died. We went over there to wrap up the body and try to figure out what happened since he was not sick and had been acting just fine. My husband and I were talking about it may having been a stroke or heart attack.At this point my MIL comes in the room and asks what we thought happened. I told her since my husband was very upset and not wanting to speak. She then started saying maybe it was my husband's fault since he hadn't checked on them that day (he had dialysis while I was at work and was feeling terrible).I immediately told her that it was no one's fault, there's nothing anyone could have done, and not to ever say that to him again. I was calm and made sure not to yell because it was her house. This is when she started screaming at me, calling me a bitch, and telling me to get the fuck out of her house. Mind you, I was still wrapping up the guinea pig's body.This is where I may be the Asshole.After she started screaming at and cursing at me, I called her a whore and yelled at her to walk away. She finally did after continuing to scream at me for a minute. After she left, I made sure my husband knew it was not his fault and that she should not have spoken to him like that.My MIL has never liked me and this would be the least of the things she's ever said to me. That being said, I've only ever cursed back at her one other time. She has always treated my husband like this, and he was taught he was supposed to just take it and not defend himself.I, on the other hand, had to fight off my drug addict parents my whole life. This does not mesh well with my in-laws' ideals of a woman being seen and not heard. They believe I should have kept my mouth shut and let him take care of it if he chose to. I think that's utter bullshit. Just as it is his job to stand up for me, it is my job to stand up for him, especially when he is un a vulnerable state.I do not think I was wrong to stand up for him, but I may have been wrong to call her a whore. The few coworkers I shared this with and one friend think I went too far with that comment, some of them saying I shouldn't have said anything at all.Am I the Asshole?Edit - I'm not completely sure why everyone seems to think this story is fake? What kind of evidence do you need to believe me? If you look in my post history, you'll see me posting about these guinea pugs in other sub reddit. You'll see another post I made about my MIL being horrible.What do you want? Pictures of my dead beloved pet? Screenshots of me telling friends that my pet died? Screenshots of me getting advice about all this from my best friend? How about the call log of me calling my vet today to let them know my guinea pig had died and ask if they had any ideas of what could have happened?I posted for advice on a bad situation I'm in so that I could get help sorting it out. Telling me my post is fake isn't helping my situation. Even if you think it's fake, why don't you humor me so I can at least figure out if I was wrong or not?",

The issue is they booked an Airbnb without asking anyone about budgets/comfortability and they are asking couples to pay $700/each to share a bedroom with another couple.

My sister still lives at home (which is literally across the street from my house) since she is still in school. I let James move in after his mom kicked him out when he graduated. James works as a mechanic apprentice at the auto shop my dad owns. I’m only charging him $400/month for rent even though my mortgage payment is $1500/month and I cover all utilities and wifi plus buy all household products like paper towels, dish soap etc. My fiancé and I share a room and I thought I’d give him a deal since he is just starting out. James doesn’t have a lot of money because he is only working about 10 hours a week. The hours are part time but he frequently skips shifts and gets away with it as him and my dad are close. James and my sister have been together for about 4 years and are almost constantly fighting and getting in screaming matches. I’m not always on one side or the other depending on the argument but it has gotten super frustrating and annoying. I even saw a police log recently that the cops were called to my house while I was at work over their loud argument. They hid this from me. I love my sister but I banned her from coming over to hang out with him for a month because of the police incident. She is always welcome to come and spend time with ME instead. Besides the fighting, our initial agreement for him moving in was to help me out with house cleaning since I’m working full time and taking a few college classes. He did help me for a few weeks. Now, the large majority of the cleaning especially shared responsibilities like mopping and bathroom cleaning are put on me. He’s not messy but doesn’t do any sort of deep cleaning and will clean his single dish (not my sisters etc.) and leave the counters as is. I’m getting married in September and told him me and my fiancé would like to live alone by September as we will be planning for a family. I don’t have any personal problems with James but I want to evict him sooner because he always has friends over when I think he should be looking for a full time job or helping out with the house.

I was born with autism, and I have ADHD which was very prominent in my academic life, so I've never really lived up to my family's standards. I've been outcasted gently, and always felt like I was different. Its been four years since I told my family I am trans, and my sister supports me, however my Dad doesn't. this isn't out of character for him, since he's a very traditional and practical man. My mother on the other hand, she doesn't refer to me as a boy at all. She only calls me by my name, she slips up and calls me she, and when I try to correct her she tells me \"it is hard\". This has been going for the past four years, even though she says its hard I feel like shes just running away from my identity by just addressing me by my name and not \"he\". my sister has completely adjusted to calling me he/him pronouns.During our trip we visit a popular building and buy a tour. the tour guide asks my mother if she had two daughters, and since I don't know how to speak chinese fluently, I tell my mom to tell her she has a son and a daughter. However my mother replies with (in chinese) \"They say I have a son.\"This takes me completely off guard, I'm feeling hurt and confused. I have to admit my first thought was \"why did she say they and not just say I have a son?\" but I don't bring it up to her until we get home. I confront her and tell her why couldn't she just say she has a son and a daughter? and my Mother says her usual bit. that it's hard. She asks, \"why is it my responsibility to correct people? Why can't you do it yourself?\" I turn down this logic, because what if someone says something to her when I'm not around to correct them myself, what then? I also make it a point that she's never truly seen me as a boy and that she just avoids bringing me up. I love my mom and she's a big figure in my life. She always says she'll try and that it's hard, and I see her putting in effort to use my pronouns, but it's been four years and I don't know if she'd ever see me.Here's where I might be the asshole. I tell her I need her to help stand up for me because I can't do it alone especially when I'm in a new setting and I don't know the language. She snaps at me telling me she's sick, and shes taking heart medicine and she doesn't want to deal with all this. my sister sat there saying nothing, but thats when I feel so hurt and I don't know if what I'm doing is right by trying to push her. I just need help understanding if I should back off. It's been a long time since I came out, and I didn't expect my dad to support me but I thought my Mom would.Also this post may be deleted when I have received my judgement, since this is a very personal story to me.edit: Some of you are confused as to why I give my Dad a pass, and it's my fault for not including it. I was fixated on my mother because thats the main conflict. didn't mention it but my Dad has been verbally and sometimes physically abusive to me in the past and that is why I don't even expect him to accept me when he didn't even accept me as a child with a disability.

He doesn't work, doesn't want to work basically, didn't finish school, doesn't do anything with his life. He is also 47 years old, so a fully grown adult.The situation is just sad. And I find it harder and harder to be able to stand to be in the same room as him to be honest. It's not even just about his situation, it's also just his attitude.

It's like he has absolutely no shame about the way he lives his life.Anyway, my parents and him came to stay at my house for christmas.

I didn't say anything. But when he asked our aunt if he could have a glass of whiskey I told him he wasn't going to drink that. He very condescendengly said that \"oh but I'm not in your house right now\" and I told him point blank that he was not in my house right now but I was going to drive him back to my house. I don't care if the whiskey wouldn't be enough to get him drunk, if he would just get a \"buzz\" or whatever. If he drank that glass I would not be driving him back to my house period.

Nate has a baby at home and doesn't like going out (understandable) so my BF John just hangs out there. But it's rather excessive, or getting there. Most weekends he is over there. Well, I was alone tonight and John was supposed to be home at 9 but texted me at like 9:10ish and said \"hey, do you mind if I stay a bit longer?\" I said \"no problem but can you go grab Jane for me and bring her over since you're hanging out with Nate anyways?\" He said \"sure, no problem at all\".

But Jane said something in the truck, trying to make a joke about it and Nate was in the vehicle too and apparently he went silent and awkward.

I truly didn't mean for it to come off like that. My sister is a lesbian and I have no issue with gay people.ETA: thank you for the comments so far! I think I get it now.

All of the comments ended up being super minor things. A commented line of code here, a line duplication there. Nothing that warranted the onslaught I was presented when I logged on this morning.In addition to plastering our team Slack channel with their critiques, videos of the problem, etc, these devs also repeated one another’s critiques in the same thread, and repeated themselves more than once. It made three or four issues look like fifteen.The final straw for me was that when I looked into the code patterns that they were critiquing, every last one of them is elsewhere in our codebase authored by one or the other or BOTH of them. In other words, they are putting me on blast for the same patterns they themselves use and approve in one another’s PRs.As a result I made it a point of order to request that all PR comments be made in the PR itself on GitHub, as is standard practice on most software development teams, because to have an onslaught of critiques in two different places, many of them repeated multiple times, was a bit overwhelming. They feigned ignorance over the issue and said sure.I’ve also gotten the ball rolling to form an ERG for women and non-binary developers at the company. We represent about 5% of the workforce there and I never hear a peep from any of the other female devs. My bet is that it’s because the culture there is highly bro-centric and as I’ve experienced, toxic asf.So am I the asshole for asking them to change their habits when it comes to code reviews at work?",

The struggle is real with the baby mama drama: harassment, threats, not seeing stepdaughter, courts, police reports, etc. finally about 5yrs ago everything started to cool down after I threatened to take her to court and a sheriff said she would do jail time for defamation, harassment, stalking and death threats. My stepdaughter has been coming more and more and has even hinted on moving in. I have 2 girls of my own that my husband looks at as his own daughters and helps me raise them. My girls know no other father but him and we agreed to raise all 3grls with the same rules and consequences. The girls are; mine-15 and 12, and his is 14. So we have all teens at home right now. Recently I found some things on my daughter’s phone I found inappropriate and grounded her for a week with no phone. She was talking to people on Tik tok. She took her punishment and is now on probation at home with the phone which means I see it when I want and if she hesitates to give me the phone then she is grounded again. She was upset she got caught and threw her stepsister under the bus and said she was doing it to and talking to guys. I told my husband it and he seemed upset but didn’t really say anything. I plan on doing the same by taking the phone and checking it when it’s her weekend. But if it’s true then I will have to take the phone away and it is the only form of communication we have with her and yes I pay for the phone.If I do that and she has a fit then there is a possibility her mom might wake up from her drama-hibernation and start back up with the drama and I really don’t want the stress being 3mnths pregnant. I’m conflicted but don’t want MY girls thinking I favor one over the other, when I can admit sometimes I look the other way with stepdaughter, like her grades. She failing and has had no repercussions and mine get grounded or tv taken away. Or mine have chores and step only has her room. My kids are right: it’s not fair but it’s complicated.

They’d answer occasional questions, and in one instance sent their hvac guy to look at a potential issue we had. It ended up being minor user error, and we tipped the guy for his time.Yesterday, the seller (who stripped it down to the studs and remodeled practically all of it before selling it to us) reached out to me. Where I live, when you install a heat pump, you are potentially eligible for a rebate (that I’ll mention can be quite significant - sometimes 10k+).Apparently, the sellers HVAC guy forgot to file for the rebate and now, nearly 4 months later, they are asking for/permission to use my name and my account number with the power company (who does the rebate) to file the rebate and then asked me to sign over the resulting check to them. Obviously, being the homeowner the check would come to me should the rebate go through.It felt wrong to sign over a check potentially that large for my heat pump that I’ve owned for almost 4 months now, yaknow? Since we had been friendly and had an easy sale/etc, I sent a text that suggested we split the rebate 50/50 and long story short, they were quite mad. Paraphrasing: “Taken aback, disappointed, etc cuz they had been generous with their help and time. They’ll talk about it to see if they wanna move forward or just walk away. Then said I may believe they made a lot of money on this project but said city codes, town requirements, and the fact that they never cut corners makes it extremely expensive, the rebate is a good portion of the profit we would make”In this message, they informed me that I guess since I do not have the invoice purchasing the heat pump or other manufacturer info, I cannot file the rebate. Oops, didn’t know that.But still, I own it now, it’s mine. I’m sorry you forgot to file for your rebate, and if your profit margin was as razor thin as you suggest, I feel like you would have been more on top of it than 4 months after you sold it to me. I guess I see it as, considering the fact I don’t have to help them at all, it was a nice compromise to split the rebate.Anyway, sorry for the novel. I can see both sides I guess, and not sure if I was out of line because I really was not expecting the explosive response I got. So, Reddit, AITA for asking to split the rebate?",

What the autoclave does is heat up to such a high degree that it kills everything alive including bacteria. As long as you put inanimate objects in an special autoclave bag, they will be sterilised and the autoclave will not affect it in any other way.Veronica decided to show up for the first time in weeks to a meeting today, and since she is quite clueless as to what’s going on, I told her to sterilise some products as it is a relatively simple, and straightforward process. We just throw the items into an autoclave bag, and then into the autoclave. She decided to go against my direct orders, stating that the autoclave will melt whatever we put inside. She instead decided to use isopropyl to sterilise the products we’re going to use. I told her not to as the isopropyl was HIGHLY dangerous to the live bio products we intent on using in our experiment, and we don’t have time to buy fresh, uncontaminated samples as our project is due in 3 days. I heard from one member on the team that she decided to use isopropyl behind my back anyways, and that everyone in the room tried to stop her as she was going against my direct orders and we have autoclaved everything in the past to test, and nothing melted. She wouldn’t listen to anyone. I sent the following message in the team groupchat:“YOU DISOBEYED MY DIRECT ORDERS TO NOT PUT IT IN EHTANOL. AS YOUR CAPTAIN I EXPECT YOU TO VALUE MY INPUT. YOUR ACTIONS SHOW PURE IGNORANCE AND IDIOCY. YOU HAVE POTENTIALLY JEOPARDISED THE ENTIRE EXPERIMENT WITH YOUT BIG ASS EGO AND REFUSAL TO LISTEN TO ANYONE BESIDES YOURSELF.  You will face the appropriate consequences xx.”I then asked her to fix her mistake by emailing our mentor and following through with the appropriate steps to which she said “After you call me an ignorant idiot, no. Deal with it yourself. If you want to message me with isntructions after I start the process, I don't see you as a very responsible captain.

BF gets paid weekly, while I get paid monthly so I thought it wouldn't be an issue for him to sign up whenever. When I later told BF about the challenge separately he said \"I already signed up for a challenge online\" which I took as he signed up for the challenge online. So I was happy we would be doing this together. While at the gym today I talked to Trainer about the challenge again and mentioned how Bf signed up online, however Trainer said you can't sign up online, it is actually just a request to have someone reach out about it. Trainer said we could talk to BF together about it since he was also in the gym. Wevtold BF about this and Trainer said he had time to sign him up for the challenge right then if he was interested. BF said yes and they went to the front desk. I agreed to send BF the 100 in case he didnt have it. During this time I had to step out to take a work call and when Trainer went to pull the money BF's card declined. He texted me asking me to send the money, so I finished my call quickly and sent it. Everything seemed fine until we got home. BF said he felt pressured into signing up for the challenge and didn't feel it was beneficial to him because he didn't want a trainer and wanted to do it on his own. BF said he had previously lost 20lbs on his own and knew he could do it again. He felt he wasted $100. He said I know he can't say no to people and he was pressured into doing something he didn't want to do. He also said when he told me he signed up for a challenge it was a different one and I should know they have multiple kinds of challenges at the gym.

He said I should have asked them about their different challenges to which I said I had no idea there was more then 1 so how could I have known to ask.

Ever since me and my husband got married, me and Annie have always been great friends and we do nearly everything together. We share everything including makeup products and lip products.Me and Annie were getting ready for a family wedding and my husband was in the other room also getting ready. Me and Annie were getting ready as usual doing our makeup. For context I had two benetints. One I had used for my face, (eyes,lips,blush). The other I had used for its traditional intended purpose. Please search it up if you don't know. Also, my husband is aware that I use benetint for that specific reason.I had used up all my benetint that was used for my face and my other benetint was in the back of my makeup drawer hard for anybody to really see it. Annie looks into my drawer for anything else she could use for her face and she pulled out the benetint. She said it was a great colour and she was twisting it open to use it. I quickly snatched it from her and kind of said loudly 'don't use that!' I only raised my voice due to pure shock. Annie was appalled and looked at me confused. She didn't really say anything for the time being (5 mins) and left with a flustered look on her face.I know I said that me and Annie were close, but I just didn't feel really comfortable telling her what I 'actually' used it for. I left the room to go into the room my husband was in and heard Annie and my husband talking. The most I heard was, 'She was really rude when she spoke to me honestly I'm offended..I thought we were on good terms'. I decided the best thing to do was go in and talk this out. My husband obviously understood the issue as he knows what the benetint was for but Annie was still left in the dark on this. I tried telling her that the benetint just wasn't for the purpose she wanted to use it for however she kept pressing on the issue and was demanding I tell her what it was for. I'll be honest I was a little confused myself on why this was a whole issue. Annie left the room and me and my husband looked at each other in pure shock.Fast forward to the wedding. Things took a whole turn as I could see Annie going around to my in-laws and telling them what had happened and how I was so rude when I snatched the benetint off of her. Now I have my in-laws telling me to treat Annie with more respect because she's older and I should have just given the benetint. I'm trying to make this neutral but I can't bring myself to tell them what it is used for. It's embarrassing for me and I believe it's kinda personal. The only person who is on my side is my husband as he is aware of the whole purpose.So what can I do in this situation? AITA?P.S: This is the first time I've used Reddit for an actual post so I'm not sure if this is the right post to  use 'AITA'.",

	"body" : "Some context: my boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. We always had this problem where we’d make plans, and his friends would randomly invite him to do something, so he would cancel our plans to hang out with them. I’m a big planner. I like my days to be mostly planned the day before because I struggle with severe adhd and routine helps me.Today, I was asked to babysit my little cousins, and so I agreed. I asked my boyfriend to come with me because he gets along great with my cousins and if overall makes it easier plus we have been working a lot and haven’t seen each other much and so he agreed. Then about 30 minutes later, an hour before we are supposed to go, he calls me saying his friends decided to go camping and he’s going to go with them instead, and that since he’s not getting paid for it, nor did my aunt ask him to do it directly, he doesn’t see why he should go. This has been an issue for quite sometime in our relationship, so I got pissed and told him I’m not talking to him for the rest of the night and that I feel like this is disrespectful to do so often. I told him I don’t care if he hangs out with his friends if they ask the day before, because we are moving in together soon and I’ll be in charge of dinner and we will have chores so if he randomly decides to go out, then I’ll never know what’s going on, and that causes me so much anxiety. He knows how I am, and always promises to help me, but he then does shit like this. I’m tired of it. So Reddit, am I the asshole for not letting my boyfriend hang out with his friends?Edit: He says I never let him hang out with his friends, which is what makes me speculate that maybe I’m the asshole for this",

I'll help with packing, making food etc. I am like a second mom to my brother (when we are away from my mom).My brother has only realized now that he if he wants a relationship with my dad, he actually has to put in effort. He tries his best, like pushing and packing away stuff... But he does it wrong, and doesn't learn from his mistakes. So, I have to redo it. I'm not complaining, I love my brother, but he is very oblivious to his surroundings, like we all are when 10. I don't blame him, but me being the favorite child is obvious.Like, if I have a headache, he will apologize and hug me (my dad that is). If my brother has a headache, my dad will say, something like this: \"Did you drink enough water?\" With an annoyed/tired tone. Things like that. My dad will come up to me, and hug me and ask if I'm okay. He wont do that with my brother.My brother and dad are both trying, but they aren't they both clash more than I'd like.

A week before the party, my friend told me that some people wouldn’t come if he was there, and would rather have everyone together than have him there, but that they still really wanted me there, even if I just stopped by, but understood if I wanted to sit this one out. I told my partner this and he got really upset, thinking that they hate him and don't want him around. (he has a reputation and my friends had a hard time coming around and some are still not super supportive)  My feelings were hurt because I definitely wanted to spend the time with both him and my friends, but I was out of town and wanted to talk more to my friends about it when I got back.When we got back we talked and they told me they don’t dislike him, but this was Js last party in town and they want their close friends, and people planned to wear more revealing outfits that they were not comfortable wearing in front of him. I understood this, and was looking forward to clearing the air and talking with my partner more, but still wasn’t sure if I wanted to go for the whole thing, but wanted to go see some friends from out of town. I got back & started explaining to my partner, & he said really mean things about my friends, calling them “bigots” and “ageist” and saying they were “two-faced”. I did not like that and told him to not talk about my friends that way. He refused to back down after I mentioned people would be wearing revealing clothes, saying it was a “sexualized thing” and I shouldn't go anyways. (We were polyamorous, but recently decided to be monogamous for a while, and I have kissed someone at this party) I feel like he doesn’t trust me, and has recently been showing signs of possession, but has never acted like this before. We argued about this for the entire week before the party, he refused to see when he was overreacting, & didn’t want to respond to J (host) who reached out to him after we talked it over.NYE comes & I’m not feeling great, & we still haven’t come to an agreement. I decided to go for a little bit to see my friend from out of town and then go home, we continued to argue and I feel like this is going nowhere. I have explained that the way he reacted hurt my feelings and that I felt guilty for going, and he hasn’t apologized or acknowledged that I feel like he doesn’t trust me, and feel like I didn't do enough to defend him to my friends.. I continue to assure him that I love him and that no one is attacking who he is as a person, just that the wasn't invited to this, but I feel like I can't do enough. my feelings are hurt too, & it’s hard to continue to show up for him when I’m exhausted, emotionally, & physically. I need to feel like he is taking a step toward me, instead of fighting me. We are taking a week apart (he has his kids) to give each other some space to think",

I on the other hand don't believe my kid is being malicious or manipulative and science backs me up. Arguments with his kid have revolved around this difference of belief that my son and I share in science and my ex not. I defended my son's disorder in front of his dad and his dad has disavowed any further visitation because of it.I (in my 40s) have been divorced rom my ex for that majority of my (teenaged) sons life. We share custody and have been civil for the most part until my son hit puberty. My son has some issues and I'm raising him with methods that are backed by science for his issues. My ex (in his 50s) is having a huge amount of personal issues with my son. Some of these issues are cultural (he's from a conservative country and has even more conservative parents than he was and they are very anti medical science) very much disliking my ex and my ex's family; disliking him in particular as a person for many reasons both financial and personal, I've always tried to be supportive of my son connecting with that side of his culture and spending time with his dad until now. Last summer my son and him really got into it while they were on vacation overseas. My son came back angry and not wanting to talk with him or about it much. During the vacation I spent hours and hours being a mediator between my ex and my son and spent most of the time trying to coach my ex on compassionate child raising techniques.Fast forward to Christmas. I sent my kid to my ex (he's about half a day away now) and my son wanted nothing to do with him. My ex texted me nonstop picking fights, accusing me of ruining his kid, telling me he's going to be a useless bum because of how I'm raising him, etc. Three days into the vacation my son had an issue and my ex blew up, screaming at me, yelling at his kid, gaslighting him over his issue (it's well documented, I'm just avoiding the what because I don't think the what is relevant, esp if it's backed by evidence that it exists ), and so on. He accused me of trying to spread my \"fake diseases\" to my kid and giving him a lifelong excuse for bad behavior.I lost my patience at this point and started sending him peer reviewed papers and defending my kid and my son saw and heard it. My ex wants to take him on a wilderness survival trip to \"shake some Sense into him\" and I said in no way would I sign off on it. My ex has as a result, said he doesn't want anything to do with his kid until he's 18 and I no longer can prevent him from doing these things to his kid. Am I the asshole for defending my kid from his dad in front of him?edit: since someone seems to think it matters (I still don't) my son can be considered part of the spectrum. lots of disorders there, keep it kind please.  fyi my son is kind as a person himself, he just has issues that can be treated and I don't believe he should be subjected to forced masking. I'm not interested in debating the validity of spectrum disorders there are other places for that. I got him diagnosed. He's getting medicine. He has an IEP. At home we use compassionate parenting and he has a therapist. All of these are things my ex is extremely against and very angry about both in my direction and in his sons direction. question isn't \"am I being a good parent in getting him treated based on the most current scientific studies for his condition\" it is \"am I an asshole for defending him against his father's culturally held anti science belief systems that I think are damaging my son's mental health, or am I just being culturally insensitive?\"",

The place I ended up going to was advertised as a barber shop (probably my first mistake) I walked in and saw a sign that said they did women’s hair cuts along with other services that catered to women. I still asked the ladies if they did women’s haircuts and if they could cut my hair and they said yes.Service and experience:I told the stylist I wanted wispy bangs and she said she needed a picture. I showed her the picture and she commented that the hair would be in my eyes and asked if that was okay I said yes I actually wanted it longer than the picture and she said okay. There was silence for a while which I’m fine with. Here’s the conversation she startedStylist: do you speak SpanishMe: yes, but I understand better than I speak.I live in a predominantly Mexican/latino town. Usually when people ask this question and I give my answer they say something along the lines of oh that’s good you need to practice more though. I’m guessing she was asking this to see if she could talk shit about me to the other stylist.Stylist: your hair is really dry; you don’t wash it do you? You have dandruff you need to be washing your hair every day.I know from personal experience and advice from other stylists that this is wrong so I just brush the comment off. More silence for about 2 minutesstylist: you don’t use conditioner do you? I can tellMe: no I do use conditionerStylist: hmm your hair is really dry you need to use it more oftenMe: okayStylist: how often do you wash your hair?Me: every other day. One day I’ll wash it the next day I won’t.Stylist: yeah you need to wash your hair every day it’s dryStylist: what products do you use?Me: I can’t really remember. I use shampoo and conditioner and then a leave in conditionerStylist: why do you use that product? It’s because you don’t wash your hairMe: I use it after I wash my hairNot sure if she thought I meant dry shampoo. I don’t use that anywayI don’t think it was her calling my hair dry that upset me, I think it was the way she was saying it. She wasn’t giving advice, at least not good advice and she kinda stuck to the same spiel. Sounded like she was trying to shame me.The bangs she cut weren’t blended or anything. Very blunt cut straight across. She showed me the end result I said it was fine, paid her, left, got back home and cried.I just went to my usual salon and my stylist was able to blend in the bangs better and she even fixed the overall trim I got.Would I be the asshole if I went back the stylist and told her how rude she was and let her know she did a bad job?

We are in college, and the idea is that my friend and the other roommate are not going to allow the other roommate to live with them next quarter. The lease is quarterly.My friend told me about this, and how he feels he’s right because he believes cheating is wrong. (Edit: He asked for my thoughts on the whole situation). While I agreed that cheating is wrong, I called him stupid for getting involved in business and drama that doesn’t concern him. I said that this is between his roommate and his girlfriend, and it isn’t his decision to kick this guy out. I also reminded him that all three of them signed a contract, so it isn’t necessarily his decision to make sure this guy is out. He claims that him and the other roommate are “working” something to make sure this guy isn’t living with them next year. (Edit: There are university apartments, so apparently they are both going to go to the university directly. No idea what they are going to say)Whether this actually happens or not (I doubt), I told him that his intentions are wrong and he shouldn’t be getting involved in business that isn’t his. He then said that I’m implying that what the roommate did is correct and other stuff. I then reminded him that what happens between his roommate and his girlfriend is there business, and it doesn’t make sense either way since him cheating in no way affects the living situation that all three of them have. The conversation just kept going in a loop of him implying that I support the roommates actions, and me telling him that his roommates actions doesn’t affect him and he’s being petty.Edit: I am making these edits to clarify information and prevent people from making assumptions. I am not here to debate.Many are saying that I am getting involved in drama. I am not getting involved in this situation at all. My friend asked for my opinion and I gave it, along with laying out the facts for him. I also reminded him that their lease for next quarter is signed, so unless somehow this guy cheating affects their living situation, then they can’t kick him out. I told him his only option is to sign the lease with someone else the quarter after.I should also note that supposedly the roommate was cheating the entire quarter. However, my friend said that the living situation was smooth and stayed the same throughout. That’s when I told him his cheating roommate didn’t affect his living situation.At the end of the day, I don’t care if my friend and his other roommate get this guy kicked out. It doesn’t concern me. But I was asked for my thoughts on a situation, so I gave it.Edit 2: People are confused about what I mean when I’m saying the lease is signed for next quarter. The next quarter is from Jan 12th to April 12th. This means that all three of them are going to live together until April 12th. I should note that getting leases for certain apartments in the university is very difficult, and the university rarely kicks anyone out unless someone is doing something very detrimental (Using/selling drugs, vandalizing, etc.)",

My Mom is happy and i know it helped to make her day but my partner is furious with me and saying i went against her wishes and trying to tell me it was rude and mean of me to do so when she told me no. I explained that it would have sounded alot worse if id replied with something like ‘sorry not right now she doesnt want to/cant talk’. I know she was in a rush but there was no harm done and only good things came from it, i feel if anything i did her a favour by helping her and my Family stay in touch, she has only met my Mom once in the time we have been together (2 Years) because of the distance and they have never had any big arguments and disagreements.It’s important to me my family and her get along and it seems to me that now she is just being angry for the sake of it, theres no real world negative effects that came from that at all.

Seems you’re right, didn’t think at the time that her reason for not wanting to talk was anything other than being busy and that a few seconds couldn’t hurt, they chatted over the phone before.

	"body" : "So, newly married, my husband and I are planning our honeymoon. His ultimate dream is going to Japan – the country he's always wanted to visit but was typically out of reach for us (way too expensive). Thanks to the wedding, this trip becomes a reality, and it's awesome. We plan it out, and first twist: his job sucks with vacation times, and it's either smack in the middle of summer in August or early May, nothing else.August is twice as expensive and definitely not ideal for Japan so it's absolutely out of the question. So May seems perfect. It's affordable, it's spring – boom! We're excited, thrilled, and then, bam, second twist. I have a concert right in the middle of the trip. Damn. I'll have to cancel.And here's the snag – I really don't want to cancel. It's Taylor Swift concert. An artist I've followed since I started understanding English, I've grown up, learned, and lived with her music. Her discography is ingrained in me. Plus, this concert is the Eras Tour, a special one covering all her albums from the beginning. Something unique that I won't get to experience again. Especially since Madame Swift doesn't often tour in my country, making it a rare event in itself. And to add to all of that, I've never went to any show of that scale, so it would be an absolute first for me.Am I the asshole in this situation? It's just a concert. Isn't my relationship, heck, my marriage, more important than a show? In what world can I justify this? I feel guilty for even thinking it, for not being able to make a decision, for creating this discord in my relationship. He doesn't seem to get what make this decision so hard on me, so maybe it shouldn't be hard ? Quick note, it's not the honeymoon itself that's jeopardize but specifically the Japan destination being impossible if I do not cancel the show. It's really more a question of my dream of Taylor Swift vs his dream of Japan.Edit : The honeymoon is happening no matter what. It's specifically Japan as a destination part that's in questioning if I choose the concert. I'm not attached to any destination, as long as I'm with him it's the perfect trip. For him, Japan as a honeymoon is kind of a unique opportunity because it's a trip that's hard to plan without this type of occasion. In a lifetime, we could find a way to go there as a \"normal\" trip, but we might as well never have that opportunity ever again.Edit and conclusion : Thank you all so much, and I mean everyone – yes, even those who jumped to conclusions about me being a wife just because I'm a Taylor Swift fan, and those who didn't hold back on assumptions.So, we're headed to Japan, and I'm thrilled to say I'll be enjoying the concert too. Your feedback and ideas on prioritizing everything really helped me see the bigger picture. I came to realize, thanks to your insights, that what mattered most was the significance of Japan to my husband. It was intricately tied to the honeymoon aspect of our trip, which wasn't initially clear, given that we had considered multiple destinations before settling on Japan.My plan was to cancel the concert as soon as this became clear. Without any remorse. However, he managed to persuade me otherwise. You see, even if someone doesn't share your taste in music, it doesn't invalidate the profound connection one may have with a particular artist. Being a 27-year-old French male, I'm quite used to people not getting the impact TS has had on my life. Fortunately, my wonderful husband not only understood this but also recognized its importance. Together, we made compromises and adjustments, finding a way to accommodate both his wish and mine.As a closing note, I can't help but think that the tone of all this might have been different if Taylor Swift hadn't been mentioned. I thought that it was quite irrelevant, but all of you made it abundantly clear: just because she's who she is, then I'm the worst person. Well done.",

I just apologized after that and he repeated it again, telling me to stop being sad for no reason and to actually do something. This made me upset, but I said nothing. I know this all seems irriational or that I'm pulling him down, but it's hard to control emotions., due to bpd, autism, and some more stuff.

	"body" : "My fiancé and I have been together almost 3 years, just engaged last month. He has 2 grown children and I also have 2 grown children. We are both divorcees who swore we would never get married again, but here we are years post divorce and engaged.My issue is, my fiancée gives his grown son approximately $1,000 a month, I know this after a recent conversation we had with some friends when he just casually brought it up when we were talking about extra money we could be spending on certain things but instead are spending it on XYZ..for instance, I was spending my extra money on a trip that he and I had talked about going on and then he didn’t have the money to go so I went with a friend, and he said he was fine with it. I was very upset that he was not going to be able to go, and I even offered to pay for his part and he refused. Well, during the conversation with the friends I learned he didn’t have the extra money because of this grown child, 25 years old with a college education and a career that pays good! I was baffled. I knew he would give him money occasionally for whatever but $1,000 “approximately” every month is a little outrageous in my opinion. Especially when it interferes with things that we are or were going to be doing together and now can not.I honestly do not even know what to say to this or how to respond, is our time together not worth turning down your kid for some spending money? He doesn’t even “need” the money, it’s money he spends on gas, eating out, and hanging out with his friends and GF!. AND is it to much for the man to get his passport?! I’ve begged and went out of the country on trips by myself that he was supposed to go with me on, even said he was going to get his passport but 2 years later has yet to do so, because he does not have a desire to travel internationally.. I just want my partner to travel with me to new places, and yes some of the places are out of the continental US. Is this all just to much to ask of him? Should I be more understanding of his side?",

	"title" : "AITA for taking a friend's guild and kicking them out?",
	"body" : "I know, it's just a video game. But there's people on the other side of the screen and now I'm feeling really guilty.In 2018 I joined a guild in a popular MMORPG. The person who ran it, Jenna, can be a lot to deal with sometimes. While she's genuinely a good person and tries to do the right thing, she can be very blunt and argumentative. I have great memories of Jenna and the stories she's given us as a RP community and many of my friends I've found because of the home she's given us. Her leadership style is often \"like it or leave it\" and while she does protect our friend circle fiercely, there are times where I've been genuinely afraid of her. She often came across as yelling at people she disagreed with, and a lot of us were afraid to let her know how we felt. She never yelled at us directly in voice chat, but in text, Jenna always sounded so angry.Two months ago, Jenna said she needed to take a break from the game to take care of IRL stuff. Apparently, her boyfriend had quit his job, and they'd both run out of money. Jenna told us (her officers who are basically second in power to her) that she didn't know when she'd return. She also told us that she was worried of letting go of her leadership position, as she'd been betrayed by a friend in 2009, and she still hadn't gotten over it. We assured her everything would be fine. She gave ownership of everything to me. Let's be clear here, this wasn't just a group of friends; it was everything Jenna had put in over the last 7 years -- This guild was stacked with trophies from difficult fights, a fully decorated fortress (the biggest guild housing you can get in the game, and very hard to come by, especially these days) and almost 300 million in the game's currency that Jenna would give away constantly. Jenna loved helping people, and would go out of her way to do so if they ever asked.After talking, we decided to break the news that we no longer wanted her as our leader. We offered her to keep a position as a regular member in the guild. Jenna didn't like that. She said we betrayed her trust, and stabbed her in the back. She became more and more furious as time passed. Jenna asked us to have a conversation via voice with us, which we agreed to a time for, but we were all much too afraid to go in when it came. We decided to let her sit in the voice chat, alone. Jenna became upset that we blew her off, and asked why we weren't showing up. One of my officers, Maria, was getting more and more combative in her way of talking to Jenna, calling her abusive and useless, which only made things worse. Jenna offered to leave to keep the peace, and Maria jumped the gun, banning her. Jenna didn't even get a chance to say goodbye.Now everything is in disarray. Friendships that were almost a decade long are in ruins. Jenna is very likely furious at all of us, though she hasn't directly messaged any of us in almost two weeks.Did I do the right thing? AITA?",

If he wants to spend $428 a month on propane to heat his house to 80 °f, it's not my decision.My main issue is that grandpa spends most of his time in his recliner, the same room where the thermostat is, also the largest room with the fewest vents. However I spend most of my time in the kitchen, the room with 3 vents.I walk into a furnace every morning, one that is over 84°f. I don't touch his thermostat, despite what my relatives say.

A super powerfull vintage powerhouse of a ceiling fan. With the vents closed and the fan on, I can get the temp down to 80°f, if I'm lucky it'll get down to 78° in the afternoon.Alas, grandpa no longer wears thermals and long sleeve shirts so he gets cold.

She’s supposed to find her own place or move back to dorms before the next fall semester.Anyways, our mutual friend, Sam, found out that she needed pretty major dental work done.

Her family could only afford to pay for the first option, since the second one was $41,000 (out of pocket).

I was relatively calm throughout as I was still holding the baby and trying to settle himLast night I (31F) went to bed, I have work today and was kept up the night before by our baby, I was also in work yesterday. When I got into bed I realised I had my charging cable but no plug so I texted my partner (34M) to bring one with him when he came to bed, he was still up. He doesn’t have work today or yesterday, he’s off for Christmas. He said no but I asked again because I was already in bed, very tired, and also the baby was very restless. I then fell asleep as I was exhausted only to be woken up by him standing near the bed telling me that there was a plug on my bedside table. I said please can you plug it in as you’re next to the extension lead and I’m asleep. He said no do it yourself I’m busy, so I said it’s right next to you and I would have to get out of bed to get to it please plug it in I have work in the morning and I was asleep. I then drifted back off to sleep as I was absolutely exhausted. I was woken up about 2:30 by the baby crying, it always ends up being me who settles him even when I have work. I noticed that my phone still wasn’t charging and I needed it to have been plugged in so that my alarm would for off for work. I was cuddling our baby so couldn’t plug it in so I said to my partner please can you plug it in so it doesn’t die. This started a huge argument where he said it wasn’t his responsibility, I shouldn’t be so lazy and he had said no already so wouldn’t do it. I said you were stood right next to it earlier and I asked you to plug it in, he said that just because I ask him a favour doesn’t mean that he has to do it. I agree with that however spending 2 seconds to push a plug into a socket I wouldn’t describe as a favour, to get to the plug and extension lead he didn’t even need to move his feet so I don’t think I was asking too much of him. The argument escalated because we were both adamant we weren’t in the wrong, he said you can ask anyone and they’d all say he was right and I was an asshole for being annoyed that he didn’t do it. His reasons for not it doing were that he was busy because he was getting ready for bed and because he was just in a towel. He thinks I’m the asshole because I expected him to do something instead of doing it myself and I’m lazy (I was actually asleep not being lazy which he knows). I think he is the asshole for waking me up in the first place (I would have just plugged in his phone and not disturbed him) and for refusing to do something that would take him 2 seconds to save me having to get out of bed when I had already fallen asleep.So AITA for being annoyed that my partner didn’t take 2 seconds to plug my phone in for me?",

I’m not totally surprised; she has been taking science and math courses that just happen to be prereqs for medical school, and she’s always been interested in anatomy and human health, but I’m still a bit devastated. The reason I’m upset is because I’ve spent so much time specifically trying to give her a soft landing into the world of finance.

We went to different colleges so the long distance really damaged our relationship as it was hard for us to see each other since neither of us had a car. After a few weeks of being in school, my girlfriend asked me if it would be ok to open the relationship since we weren’t able to see each other as often as we wanted to. I stupidly agreed thinking it wouldn’t be a problem. A note that my ex’s birthday is in late September and mine is in early October (not saying exact dates for privacy). We opened our relationship mid September. When her birthday came around, I bought her a few small gifts from Temu, 5 or 6 small silly items. We FaceTimed when the package arrived and she unboxed them and loved them. Time passes and we FaceTime each other when we can but I can tell she’s more distant and talking to other guys which is ok because we agreed to open the relationship. When my birthday comes around, no package arrives and my ex gives no indication of a present coming. I call her and we talk about our days and then I bring up my birthday asking if she got me anything. She says she has some things but hasn’t sent them yet, so I happily await a package for another week. It doesnt come. Thanksgiving break comes along and we meet up back in our hometown to discuss how our relationship is going. During our conversation, I ask her about my birthday gift and if she brought it with her from school. She says she forgot it in her dorm and she’ll send it as a Christmas present. A few weeks after thanksgiving, she breaks up with me because she met another guy at her college. I knew it would happen eventually and I really was in a bad state for a while. When Christmas came around we briefly started talking again. I told her that during Black Friday I had got her a small gift (some perfume from bed bath and beyond’s super sale) maybe hinting that she could get me something too. She had no present for me. I wasn’t all that surprised but I kind of expected something. When I gave her my gift and she didnt have anything for me I just stood there. I didn’t say anything or yell but I just felt sad. I understand that we weren’t in a relationship anymore but she could’ve gotten me something. Or at least given me the gift she had already bought for me for my birthday.

	"body" : "2023 was a rough year with a series of events that ultimately put me close to being unable to fulfill some of my customers orders on time (I run an ecommerce store). Being already over leveraged, credit solutions were not an option so I decided to borrow from my 401k retirement fund. You're allowed to borrow up to 50% of your plan. The trouble is I'd already borrowed from it a few years prior and most 401k plans only allow one loan at a time, meaning I had to pay back the first loan fully before I could be allowed to take another one and I wasn't liquid enough to do so myself so I need help. For those wondering, doing this would allow me to access a larger portion of my 401k, give back what was borrowed, and use the difference.I asked a few friends including my sisters husband with whom I'm not close with but have interacted with on multiple occasions including discussing relationships. More importantly he had offered to helped out before in the past which he had and his support was fully returned. Anyway, he said he'd look into it letting me know that he might be able to help.About a week later I called my sister just to say hi, something I do every once in a while. After what seemed like a good conversation she tells me she did not like the fact that I'd asked her husband for assistance without first giving her a heads up.

The thought that any request some request I might have must first be get her seal of approval makes no sense to me and I have since decided not to take the assistance and explore other options.Am I missing something here?

She was very upset about this-- am I the asshole?FOR CONTEXT: My mother and I were extremely close when I was growing up. But my mother and I haven't had the best relationship for the past 12-ish years-- I came out as trans about ten years ago and my mother took it very hard. I was her only child and she treated me like her special little bestie for most of my life. We're now at a point where she's able to accept me as her son and doesn't really slip up on my pronouns or my chosen name. Knowing that our relationship and me having kids is really important to my mother, my wife and I agreed to invite my mother to visit when her first grandchild is born.Now, this is where things get a little more complicated.  Me and my wife have been living in an expensive city on the west coast of the US. Because of the cost of living and us both getting laid off, we're biting the bullet and moving back east to stay with my wife's family while she's pregnant with our first child. We will be guests in my in-law's house when the baby is born, which means that my mother will have to get a hotel for the duration of her visit. When my mother told me she was aiming for a 29-day stay, I called her and told her that she should limit her visit to two weeks.I tried to explain why in every possible way that I could as delicately as I could. I started with the financial reasons-- my mother is willingly taking on a second job to pay for the cost of visiting, and I'm really not okay with her spending that much money just on a hotel. Then I pointed out the experience from my perspective-- my wife and I are having our first child and we think that bonding with our son is really important. And lastly, I also pointed out that I'll be working 99% of the time my mother's out there and my wife will be busy recovering from delivery and we're both going to be feeding our newborn every couple of hours.My mother repeatedly asked if we weren't comfortable with her being there and if we were worried about her being an overbearing mother-in-law. I reassured her the entire time that that wasn't the case and repeated the reasons I listed in the previous paragraph as many different ways as I could. She looked like she was about to cry when I hung up with her.I love my mom and I'm glad we're at a good place again, but my mom can be exhausting to spend time with.

On our wedding day, my other sister (trans woman/31) informed me that she found Zeke's Twitter, which was filled with problematic content.After the wedding, we looked into Zeke's tweets. They ranged from sexist and transphobic comments to racist identity attacks that me and my wife—the only Black member of my white family—found concerning: things like \"Native Americans were not going to advance/deserved to have their land taken\", \"Black culture is inherently criminal\", \"The idea that Black people in the US are regularly discriminated against is BS\", \"Black people don't know what's good for them/need to vote right-wing\", \"People who call themselves feminists are weak\", \"Michelle Obama is a tr*nny with man hands\", an extremely harmful comment about trans people I can't spell out here, and more.I visited Amber to have a conversation, something my parents supported (they were also uncomfortable with the tweets). I expressed my concern for Amber, ensured she knew what Zeke believes & says, told her I felt uncomfortable & protective of my wife, said we may not be comfortable spending time around Zeke, & let her know I was sad my relationship with her could be affected. I avoided trying to teach, educate, or convince her to do anything. She was sad but took it fairly well in the moment.A couple days later we sent a non-accusatory, calm email to my parents & Amber with some educational resources about racism due to comments they made, including that the racist tweets were not more of a concern than Zeke generally \"not being nice\". We asserted that it's difficult to deny that some of Zeke's tweets had racist ideas/were based on racial biases, & that their deflections created an awfully dismissive experience for my wife.Everyone thought we were being unfair & unreasonable. Amber said Zeke was unfairly judged, we should've tried to get to know him better, the tweets were just \"stuff on the internet\", he's no longer transphobic, etc. We were reminded repeatedly how much Zeke & Amber were crying, how hurtful our messages were, how remorseful Zeke was (he even deactivated his Twitter), etc.Despite how hard it was for us to bring all this up, there was little empathy for us & no curiosity about my wife's experiences. We feel like we can't expect my family to be able to handle conversations like this. My wife was shown we can’t have a safe conversation about her race with my family. It felt like there was a double standard; we were being asked to try harder to understand, accept, & accommodate Zeke, but my family was not willing to do the same for us, even though I still think our concerns, approach, & boundaries are completely valid.

My mental health isn't the best so usually if I have a problem at work I chalk it up to my own anxieties and looking too deeply into things, since that seems to be the case most of the time. However, recently I decided to take my complaints about a coworker, who I'll call Eliza, to the HR department.Over the last few months, I've felt like Eliza hates me. It's just small petty things she does - like grabbing two staplers so we don't have to share and giving me the worse one, or offering her soup to the night audit minutes after she came in but not to me who's been beside her for 8 hours, or not putting both our names on our shiftly sheets. I know I'm probably being irrational, but it feels so intentionally spiteful.The things that made me contact HR was that she asked me \"Do you have a medical condition?\" and when I said 'no, why' she said \"just curious\". And she never brought it up again. What a non-work appropriate thing to ask, I would never question if I were the a-hole for just reporting that. I had the direct quote too since I started texting my sister directly afterwards, so that's not taking anything out of context or assuming anything, it's just reporting a question that I found uncomfortable. The problem is, I kept on saying assumptions.I never framed them as fact, I said everything was just speculation, but I was saying to HR how I think Eliza hates me and thinks I'm stupid/lazy/autistic, in like a way that seems that she looks down on autism. I gave examples to HR of the small things I read as petty slights like I did earlier in this post.Am I the asshole for doing this? By letting my overthinking and self centered anxiety fused assumptions possibly make Eliza's and my employers bias? I know I probably should have talked to her directly before jumping to HR but I didn't/don't know how to bring it up in person and don't want to make a self fulfilling prophecy of her actually hating me.

My brother’s fianceé and him separated about a year ago, so it’s just him and them visiting. He is a somewhat good dad, setting boundaries and limiting them, though he is also suffering from some mental issues and often gets very stressed out.The last week they’ve been visiting I’ve without fail been woken up at 7 AM (I am a night owl as that is the only time I get to be alone and not disturbed) due to both kids screaming, bouncing around and slamming doors. I have no idea if this is normal behavior for a 4 and 7 year old, but it’s driving me insane. I’ve talked to my brother, who tries his best to stop them, but obviously he can’t stop them when it’s already happened.Due to this, I get a little angry in the mornings and I am also very tired, so I keep to my room for a while. I also have no will to be around them, because I don’t even know how to talk or interact with them, and I don’t know that with any of my family members (not even parents or brothers) nor younger friends. I just keep away from them a bit, though I of course eat dinner with them, and most of the time play with them if they ask me. Yet both my brother and my mom (57) are asking of me to come down all the time and getting angry at me for staying in my room. I feel uncomfortable being downstairs as I genuinely do not want to interact with them in form of playing, hearing them babble about mobile games, nor hearing toys thrown around the room and screams (I’m sound sensitive). I also have a short temper and do not want them to see me angry at them.I feel a bit like an ass because I don’t hang out with them while they’re visiting, but I genuinely don’t see reason to. When I was a kid, I was fine playing by myself, especially when I was 7.AITA,reddit?",

They are childfree and work 9-5 and no weekends. Yesterday I was visiting and she showed me how she prepared their apartment with safety things and she also had purchased a baby chair. A thousand dollar baby high chair. I was appalled because the one I have is a 30 dollar one.I told her that she was the ah for having a more expensive chair for MY child at her place when I have a 30 dollar chair. She just shrugged and said that she was thinking about the rest of her interior and wanted a beautiful piece because it will be in the kitchen for a long period of time. I was furious and left but my husband wants me to apologize for being rude?

I understand that I was being wrong in calling my SIL ah.

She currently lives with my dad and helps with bills and stuff which is the only reason they’re not struggling financially. Once she moves out I assumed she wouldn’t be able to help as much so I was discussing it with her older sister “Sara” so we could come up with a plan to make sure our parents aren’t stuck in poverty once she gets married.According to Sara, Amy’s fiancé is going to let them move into a house he owns so they only have to pay bills and no rent (She made it seem like there’s a chance he’s going to cover the bills too but she wasn’t too sure). Without the rent they’ll be fine without any help from us which would be amazing. She also said that Amy is planning to save her salary for their mum because her fiancé is rich rich so he doesn’t need or want her to use her salary for their day to day expenses and they want their mum to enjoy her older years since she raised them as a single parent. They aren’t planning to save anything for my dad so she said that would be up to me and my siblings.I’ve met Amy’s fiancé once and while he seems like a nice person on the surface… it all sounds too good to be true. He’s also incredibly attractive (Amy is average) and if he’s as rich as Sara is making out he could easily be with anyone so I said that he sounded too good to be true and they were acting slightly delusional. I told Sara we needed to be realistic because there was no guarantee their marriage would work but Sara got touchy and was acting like I said Amy wasn’t good enough for him and that I thought he should dump her. I think she’s projecting her own thoughts onto me because it’s not like I called Amy ugly or anything.AITA?",

My mom stands up and tells my sister that her terrible attitude is ruining the night and she doesn’t understand why she would be upset over something so trivial. My mom has been through a lot of trauma in her lifetime and is actively recovering from PTSD, so she is easily triggered but working to learn coping strategies and has come a long way.My sister then says that if she is ruining the night she will just leave and she leaves. My mom keeps going on about how she doesn’t understand how she could be so upset about something minor when there are terrible things happening to her and others. I calmly explain that I understand but my sister still has the right to be upset because she just got this gift and I damaged it. My mom repeats that much more terrible things have happened to her so my sister has no right to be upset and begins to cry, going to her room and refusing to talk to us. My younger sister said she understands both sides, but I think my mom is being immature. I understand she has had a hard life, but I don’t think it means my sister doesn’t have a right to be upset.

We embarked on the IVF journey a few years ago and found out we were expecting twin girls.Months ago, we had already settled on what we thought were adorable names: Jameson Katherine and Michelle Emily, with the super cute nicknames Jay and Elle. I thought we had nailed it! However, there's a little 'joke' that I've kept to myself- if you include their middles they have the nickname potential of Jay Kay and Elle Em (JKLM). I had seen this as something to make the naming process a bit more fun and to make the twins feel connected without being overly matchy.But, as it turns out, my wife didn't quite see the humor in it. She noticed it and brought it up to me today. I told her it was intentional, and she absolutely blew up on me, accusing me of not taking our roles as soon-to-be parents seriously. According to her, I'm making light of an important decision and not respecting the gravity of the situation.So, am I the asshole here, or is my wife just channeling her inner drama queen? I mean, it's not like I named the kids after my favorite sports team or suggested 'Jenny Talia'.",

	"body" : "AITAH? So long, farewell. Blocked.AITAH? I (27f) have been with my husband (27m) for 4 almost 5 years. We have two wonderful children and one on the way. Currently, we’re in the process of moving 2.5 hours away for a relocation due to him being deployed here in the near future. We are moving things over little by little, and as you can imagine, 5 hours is a long time. Our deadline to move is in about a week and a half. My husband’s family isn’t overly fond of me, when I first started coming around, theyd make fun of me and my husband then got kicked out of the house for defending me, at least until my husband’s uncle and his current wife (we’ll call them bob and Tracy) got married, and they invited us to come to their wedding. ATP, we have seen them 3-4 times in 2 and a half years. We live 23 minutes away. Christmas rolls around and we asked them if they wanted to catch up since we knew they are usually traveling to see her family. Turns out they have Covid for the holiday. Bummer, we let them know we can absolutely meet up later on. Tracy texts both me and my husband Friday, asking if they could stop by. I said no, sorry, our house is a wreck, we have no where to sit due to boxes everywhere, and we have a dog that Tracy isn’t fond of the breed. I said how about we meet up on Monday? She said it was fine. Monday rolls around. We had a military get together the night before and we had found out we’re having another baby, days before he leaves for a year or so. At this point I’m so frazzled I’ve completely forgotten everything. We’re on our way back from dropping stuff off at the new house, and we get a text at 7 pm stating they were sorry they missed us. I was like oh my gosh I absolutely forgot, and my husband relayed that because I’m driving and it’s snowing. He lets them know something along the lines of we’re so sorry we totally forgot, can we make it up to you this weekend. They stated that they cleared their entire schedule for us for this day , and it was very rude of us not to consider their time. This is the first time we’ve ever forgotten the entire relationship. I told him that I was sorry we forgot, we’re in the process of moving, my husband has deployment stuff going on, 2 kids and it’s a lot on our plate, I also mentioned they’re super uninvolved with us and we just accidentally forgot. I was upset, and stated that if this was that important, a reminder text prior to 7 pm would’ve benefited all of us. Bob turns around and says “we’ve invited you guys over and it’s always your kids are sick or if we want to come it’s the house is a mess. I’m sorry you feel that way we’ll leave you alone”. They’ve offered to come over this weekend and last Christmas, last year our girls were sick, this year the house is wrecked due to moving. All of this was an honest mistake and I feel bobs reaction is extreme because they’re both not working and stay home since COVID.Update:  They’ve taken us off Facebook and blocked us.",

	"body" : "Hello everyone!,I need some guidance on this situation because I want to understand why my boyfriend might feel uncomfortable with me regarding his religion or \"spirituality\" as he prefers to call it. To give some background information my name is Bibi (25F) and my boyfriend is Ema (24M). I transferred from South Korea to a University in a major city in the United States. I met my current boyfriend here and things have been beyond amazing and I have never been in so much love my whole life. We both share the same love languages (quality time, physical touch, acts of service) and we want to move in together here while we both finish out masters degree.In South Korea religion is viewed quite different than people in the Americas. Yes we have Christians there and Buddhist, but in the community I am from Changwon, people tend to be atheist. My Boyfriend comes from a Latino background as he is first generation and believes in astrology, numerology and as he explained to me IFA colloquially known as Santeria. There is absolutely no issue with his beliefs and they are slowly and surely becoming mine as well. Before I never really cared for anything of that nature besides knowing my star sign but maybe falling in love with him has had his beliefs rub on me.Although my boyfriend is extremely spiritual he is secretive about his IFA beliefs and goes to temples ceremonies and the whole 9; I have always expressed interest in attending one but he brushes me off and tells me its his own religious thing that he does for himself and wouldn't want to convert me if I didn't want too. I went to a couple \"tambores\" and gatherings and felt welcomed and happy to be apart of something that Ema is so passionate about! Remember how I mentioned moving in together? well if you are familiar with the spirituality, devotees usually have items/idols they worship and pray to around their home. When we first started seeing each other he would cover them before we had sex or mentioned on certain days he blows cigar smoke and alcohol on them.... Now the issue.When we move in together I don't mind him having any his Orishas around the house but I do mind the apartment smelling like cigar smoke. I brought this up to him and he seemed understanding but prefaced again that these are his spiritual beliefs and respects my request. Ema said he would not mind doing all the cigar smoking and alcohol blowing outside on our patio but then I felt utterly remorseful because I came like a B++++. We have never had a misunderstanding on anything and this situation has made me feel horrible because I want nothing but to support him. I did come off passive aggressive and he was dry for the rest of the time we were together. I brought it up to him a few days later and he wasn't mad or anything but I still feel like I am wrong and have rethought how I may have even invading his space by attending his temple.AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for enforcing my \"toilet time\" upon my family?",
	"body" : "Obligatory apology for mobile formatting, English not my first language, et cetera.Me (18M) and my family live in a very small house, one of those old \"workers houses\" which were only designed for one person. My family is very proud of it, however, and I try not to complain.But, having said that, there's only one toilet.My family is very possessive over it. My mother has little bladder control and often needs it, my brother showers twice daily and is in there for hours doing his skincare, and my father enacts all hell on anyone who uses it when he wants it. It also just so happens that when I wanted to use it, even if I would wait ages for a free moment or ask the whole house if anyone else needed it before I went, there would always be SOMEONE who suddenly urgently needs to be in there right now or they'll die.It got to the point where I developed a fear of using the bathroom. I would only use the toilet once a day, and shower once a week at 1am to avoid the chances of being \"caught\". My family mocked me for it, but when I got in the shower even for 2 minutes (I started timing my showers for 5 minutes in the hope it'd reduce the yelling) I was always ushered out immediately. I even tried to align it with people's schedules, but I felt like I was losing a battle. Some magical force would put someone and their anger between that bathroom and I.It wasn't even that I was doing it for selfish reasons, to sit there and do my hair for hours etc. I have a really severe skin condition that requires me to get naked and ointment myself up, and my room is the only room without heating, so I need the warmth of the bathroom to get it done (I live in a cold ass country). And obviously, like most humans, I like being allowed to pee without being told to get the fuck out.Eventually I put my foot down and demanded I get half an hour on Thursdays where the bathroom is completely mine, under the reasoning that nobody was working, or should have any reason to need the shower/not be able to pee before and after. Because of my fears, I figured enforcing a \"safe time\" where I could not be ridiculed or shouted at would be beneficial. I was called ridiculous for this, saying I couldn't police when other people used the bathroom. I snapped back that they did it for me constantly, and I was told that the rest of my family \"needed it more\", as if someone can be more deserving of the right to urinate. Right now my family aren't talking to me, and I've been trying desperately to amend it to no avail.I don't feel like it's fair for me to put so much effort into trying to match their schedules only to still be harassed and I want to be guaranteed one day where I can at least give myself my meds and shower, but I understand I might be the asshole because I suppose it's very difficult to say \"nobody have any needs for half an hour\".

She mostly ignored them and when I brought it up- because it caused me some uncomfort she said that she'd \"take them down at some point.\" This slightly peeved me but even 2 months later they were still up and a very big part of her personality.

I (18F) have two cousins, Clara (25F) and Maya (22F), they are sisters.Maya is an absolute angel and honestly one of the coolest people I know. Clara is a bit of a menace and has a very unique personality, so she kind of doesn't get along very well with most of the family including me.They have a very complex dynamic. When Maya is going through a rough time, they are friendly. Like, Maya has gone through some hardships like being bullied and institutionalized, and when those things were happening Clara was generally sympathethic.Buuuut when Maya is doing fine, or god-forbid better than Clara is doing, Clara turns into an absolute monster. My personal guess is that she starts seeing her as a rival and then goes \"destroy mode\", but Idk exactly why. She starts picking fights every chance she gets, bad-mouthing her sister, and basically doing insane shit to try and ruin her sister's life.The problem is that in recent years Maya has been THRIVING, and Clara is dealing with it as she usually does: making every family reunion absolutely miserable. The mere sight of Maya is enough to set her off these days, and her most recent stunts have made Maya basically go low contact with Clara and their mom.I was dreading the New Year's Family Reunion because I knew Clara would probably start more drama (it can start literally any way: someone will greet her sister more warmly than they did with her and then she'll start yelling about us liking her sister more and how she's not that special, things like that). And then my dad told me that Maya was going to bring her boyfriend, which made everything worse because Clara has a whole thing about stealing Maya's boyfriend and it didn't work with this one and it was going to make everything even more uncomfortable.I decided to take action and texted Maya after Christmas begging for her to not come because her sister would cause conflict again and I just wanted peace for the New Years. She texted back that she was sad but understood. I offered to pay for her flight back but she just said she would go to a nearby beach with her boyfriend.New Years Eve happened and I could mostly sucessfully avoid being anywhere near Clara and didn't have to hear yelling, so I consider my plan a success. Maya posted an Instagram story about her having fun at the beach with her boyfriend so she was happy too.

Lisa confessed that she has a crush on Kylie but Kylie is straight and has a bf. Lisa is a lesbian btw.Another girl from our group “Diana” also 16 is the most social out of us and she is a part of 2 friends groups. So we kinda merged the groups and started talking all together because a girl from Diana’s group “Allie” (15) started dating Lisa and they kissed a few times.Since I’m bffs with Lisa now she confessed that she and Allie steal from shops. I went to the mall with Lisa and Allie and they stole a pair of jeans and also 2 t shirts. I was uncomfortable with them stealing and also doing PDA and so I excused myself.Turns out most of the girls in both friends groups know that Lisa and Allie steal and some have stolen as well.

I disapprove of this behaviour because they may get in trouble for that and get me in trouble too. I confronted Lisa and she told me to not tell Kylie about it as Kylie’s parents are police officers.

This morning I took our dog out for a walk and we pass by the neighbors house everytime we go for walk, they live on the corner so the street sign is in front of their house.Everytime our dog pees on it when we walk by and this morning after he did I hear their front door open and they both come out and the husband approaches me and asks how I’m doing I say I’m good and at this point he is standing very close and it feels very aggressive and he says ‘I like that dog. this street sign is not for your dog to pee on’.Our dog has recently been having an issue about peeing in the house so whenever he needs to pee we let him go cause if we interrupt him then he won’t pee at all but we never let him go on other peoples lawns.Anyways I tell him that I can’t control when he has to go pee and he said ‘you can control it, you just keep walking’ at this point I’m angry because this is not the first negative interaction we have had with him so I tell him we’re gonna keep walking now and I walk away and as I’m walking he says ‘that’s very rude of you, I shouldn’t have to clean up after you’ I just keep walking.I make it all the way around the cul de sac to the other side of the street and he yells from his yard ‘so from now on can you just keep walking?’ I still ignore him and he says ‘you don’t have to be rude we can have a polite conversation’ I still ignore him and he gets angry and says ‘fuck you, next time I’m calling animal control’.Like I said this isn’t the first negative interaction we have had with him and my girlfriend gets upset when I try to argue back with him so I just decided to stay silent this time cause I would have nothing nice to say and the fact that he was stood so close just felt like a power move or something.AITA?",

	"body" : "I (19 nb) have exactly 3 good friends. I don't make friends easily because of my autism and truthfully I've never been fond of large circles so this has been just fine with me. Only 2 of the 3 live in my state unfortunately and those are the 2 I'm having problems with.We'll call them Coal (18 nb) and Brit (19 nb). Brit  and Coal both just got out of relationships. Coal was cheated on and Brit cheated. They are both really desperate to hop back into a new relationship and have been on tinder. Now we live in a large city so there are LOTS of options and yet they matched with each other. They've met a few times through me but don't know each other very well so they both asked me if it was a good idea. I have known Brit since we were 5 and a briefly dated Coal in Highschool (we're still very good friends nothing weird between us) so I know them both very well and more importantly I know how they both behave in relationships so I know FOR A FACT this will end absolutely terribly and they will both get their feelings hurt. So I told them that I thought it was a very bad idea and furthermore that being caught in the middle of their breakup( Coal especially likes to make their romantic drama my problem) would make me extremely uncomfortable but that they are grown ups and have to make their own choices.Obviously they both ignored my advice in favor of their own horny nonsense. I AGAIN expressed how awful of an idea this is and my discomfort with this to Coal but I also told them how desperately I don't want to be involved. They apologized for being an ass and then proceeded to PUT THE 3 OF US IN A GROUP CHAT \"because we needed to talk it out\" which I would argue is the opposite of not involving me.I just restated what I'd already said and that I didn't wanna be involved to which Brit said it sounds like I just think they're emotionally immature. That comment pushed me a little to far and I'll be the first to admit that I blew up a little. Iwent of on them about how I don't think that they're emotionally immature but that I do think they are being stupid for asking for my advice and then ignoring it and selfish for refusing to believe that the consequences of their actions are going to affect me and not just them.Neither of them are speaking to me now and now that I've calmed down a little I'm wondering if maybe my discomfort is unwarranted and I over stepped.(Edited for reformatting)",

	"body" : "First things first, background context. I, (17 F) have known Star (17 F) since early 6th grade. We had been each others first friends in middle school and have been one anothers closest friends since. We know pretty much everything about each other, secrets and all, and have always been each other's first choice when needing a shoulder to lean on.In Sophomore year, the two of us had begun dating, but eventually, we decided to split off around July before Senior year (2023). We had a very loving and respected relationship throughout our time together, but in the end, Star felt that she wanted more experiences as we were each other's first serious relationship. The breakup ended on a good note with no hard feelings between one another, and we continued on living our silly teenage high school lives.In September, Star showed interest in a guy named Spot, eventually dating in October. At first me and our friend group were supportive and happy for her, but over the past months he has proven to be toxic and manipulative towards Star. No matter how many times we have assured Star that she deserves better, she continues to date Spot.Me and Star havent shared a single class since 6th grade, but this year of high school though, we finally were able to have Gov/Econ with each other. When I found out, I eagerly expressed how happy I was to finally have a class with Star and be able to work on projects with her. Along with her and I, Spot also shared the class with us, often pairing up into a group to work together. At the time, I didn't mind at all, even if Star was my ex, I saw the situation as a chance to get to know Spot and become friends. That feeling diminished after learning about his toxic behavior, but I still acted friendly towards him in order to keep the peace.Today, I had asked Star if we could be partners for the next duo project within our class, but she quickly answered no. When I asked why she explained how it would be \"really screwed up in all seriousness if I chose to partner up with my ex instead of my current partner.\" Immediately I was hit with a wave of despair. Yes, we did date for two years at the start of high school, but we have also been each other's closest friends for seven collective years. When I had brought this up, she only reinforced the fact that Spot and her believed us being exes made the situation wrong and that it would be horrible for us to be partners. The entire conversation was crushing, I really thought that our friendship had meant more in the end than our past relationship, especially when we have been entirely chill with one another since our breakup. No matter how much I tried to reason she still wouldnt budge, saying how I had a lack of understanding for how Spot felt and that I needed to be more empathetic towards his feelings. I understand how much she loves him and that romantic relationships are important, but in the end I still feel that our friendship should overshadow being exes in this situation.",

If we move, I won't be able to find a job. Also I don't want to live separately in different countries and or move and end my career. On the other side, I want to have a kid and he doesn't want.This is a huge problem that we are having at the moment. I also have generalised anxiety disorder and depression and my therapist says staying alone is not an option for my mental health. AITA for not wanting him to take this job offer?Long Post: My husband and I have been working in Asia for 8 years now. He has not many job options here due to his job being extremely niche. I am working in reinsurance sector which is booming. He recently had an online interview for a job in UAE and they are considering him for a really good role which on the paper, really good for his career. In the meantime, reinsurance sector is almost non-existent there so there is a high chance I will be unemployed.I do suffer from GAD and depression and my life turned upside down in the last month. I am not able be alone, scared of being alone, left alone etc etc. I am anxious and depressed 7/24. I am not able to sleep properly and lost quite a bit of weight.I asked him to not go (very selfishly I know), I told him staying apart is not an option for me as I will have a further breakdown. My therapist also said, me being alone is not an option at this stage of my mental health. I started on medication but as of first week, it's been quite rough. I do realise, asking him to not go because I am not mentally healthy or I am not able to find a job is extremely selfish. But I also feel like I do have a serious health issue, and he wouldn't leave me if this was a physical sickness or condition.I am scared to go with him because I don't want to bury my career as of yet. And it's because I want to have a kid and he doesn't want to. And I am not sure, If I go with him and end of not having a kid, I will be losing both my dream and my job. Him and me are both adamant in our kid decision and he asked me to give him a year to think about, but I do not think he will change his mind.So my question, AITA for asking him to not go?Edit: just to clarify, he is not happy in his job here and doesn't see any future for him.

The content wasn't incel level - it was a silly edited version of a news report where a correspondent made a comment about feminists being sensitive to \"just words\" and the female anchor called him out. The clip was edited to speed up her reaction and dub clown music over the top to make her seem ridiculous and hysterical.Unfortunately, I know firsthand how dangerous \"just words\" are. Among other things, I left a high paying job because of the environment that these comments created (think \"just put leopardess87 in a skirt and that will convince the client\" \"it's not like you have to work for your bonus, you can just show up with those legs\" kind of thing) My father knows about this, as well as some other instances - he's always been super supportive and very much backs the idea that it isn't right to treat people like that.That said, he has made some offcolour comments in the past but I've put that down to him being a bit nostalgic for his \"lad\" days. Maybe I'm a fool, but I always thought since he was there when I needed him, he was just saying things out of reflex because he's stuck in the 70s/80s.I'm really hurt and disappointed that, despite us having these sorts of conversations, he would send me some random internet thing basically laughing at a woman for calling out a misogynist and think that i would have any reaction to it other than hurt and disgust.WIBTA if I called him up and told him that I find these comments/posts disrespectful and hurtful and that by sending this over, he's showing that he supports, at least in theory, the same sort of behaviour he was so upset with when it happened to me at my old job? I love my father dearly and don't want to cause a rift but, reflecting honestly, if a friend or partner had sent me this I wouldn't have any hesitation in respectfully but firmly calling them out on it.",

	"body" : "A little background, my husband and I are recently married. He is from a foreign country, having came here on a fiancé visa. Currently, I am the only one that can work until he is approved for a work permit. I mainly do food delivery apps for money. I prefer to only do deliveries during daylight hours for safety reasons. However, lately, the payout for the apps have been really bad. My husband agreed to ride with me at night so that I could deliver at dinner time to help make up the difference.We just got back home and he’s not taking to me. Deliveries today and tonight were terrible. I made half of what I should have for a Saturday. I’ve been feeling a lot of pressure financially. Immigration is expensive. I even took my coin jar to the coin machine today so that my husband could have some cash to buy some cigarettes.I will admit that I wasn’t in the best of moods today. But I do try to keep it under wrap and not let it spill out onto the people around me.So this is what happened. I just finished dropping off some food to a customer and was headed back to the spot I wait at for delivery offers. On the way there, my husband said he needed to use the restroom. I knew there was a smoothie place near by that I had a gift card for. I suggest it and said I needed to use the restroom too and was hungry anyways. He agreed. I parked, and  put the delivery app on pause.I said, this place probably needs a code for the bathroom door so we have to ask for it. He then saids never mind. (He’s familiar with having to use codes because we have been to other restaurants that do it too.) I basically just reply, “What?” And he says nothing. I reaffirm that I need to use the restroom too and I’ll ask for it. His response was that he will go to the mall. (Sometimes I take him there since it is by the area I wait. But it takes a long time to go in and out.) I’m pretty annoyed at this point and let out a loud sigh. It’s a bad habit I have. He questions why the sigh and I say that we are here now, going to the mall is a waste of time and I don’t understand why he is being so difficult. But I dropped it and started the app again and headed there.While he is in the mall, I get a good delivery offer and start messaging him to please hurry up. After a few mins, I start calling him. He doesn’t answer. Finally I see him and flash my light at him where I’m parked. (I had dropped him in front.)During the next and last delivery for the night, he has his earbuds in and won’t respond to me when I tap his leg. When we got home, he heads to the bathroom before I can (I still haven’t gone myself) and he turns on the water, ignoring me asking if he was jumping in the shower.So, am I the asshole here? For whatever reason, he wasn’t comfortable using a code at the smoothie place and I was very audibly annoyed with him.",

It has to be tightly packed, otherwise it tastes watery, and when you dump it, it’s like espresso soup instead of a clean espresso puck. I have already resigned to him never making me a good cup of coffee, I nicely told him I don’t need him to make my coffee in the morning because I just pour it out when I get to work, so he doesn’t any longer.However, I noticed I was having to fill it up with water often. It turns out when it was empty, he was putting in just enough water for a cup for himself. When I saw him in the act, I said “if you’re going to do that can you just fill it all the way so I don’t have to keep filling it.” He said “I only need this much.” It felt silly to even explain why you should fill up the whole machine in the first place so I just repeated myself and he sheepishly agreed.He just went on a short trip to a friend’s house for three days, left on New Year’s Day out of the blue, he came home because his school starts today, and I go to make espresso and the machine is empty, with only a watery soup of espresso in the handle that sloshed on the floor when I went to clean it.It’s my machine and I’m the only one buying espresso and it annoys the hell out of me. Is it reasonable to just tell him he is no longer allowed to use it? I feel like a 1950’s husband mad that his wife can’t make a decent cup of coffee. AITA?",

	"body" : "Backstory first. “Amy” and I became friends through a mutual friend, “Lisa” when we were teenagers. We went to different high schools and lived in different towns, but we hung out on weekends and over the summers. Back then, Amy was pretty in a high-maintenance kind of way. She also dated a lot of guys. I was pretty, too, but more of a girl-next-door type. I dated, but it was more quality than quantity. Her relationships usually burned out after a few months. She’d have another guy within a week after the breakup. She also dated a good friend of mine from my high school, “Tommy.” They were over within two months. The break was amicable, and they remained friendly.Fast forward to after college, Amy and I had drifted apart as friends often do, so I was a little surprised when I got her wedding invitation. I was happy for her and flattered to be invited. The invitation had a Plus One. I wasn’t dating anyone at the time and suspected I wouldn’t know anyone other than her parents and Lisa, so I asked Tommy, who I was still friends with, to be my date. He vaguely remembered her but was happy for her and sincerely looking forward to attending. I sent off my RSVP with his name as my guest.At the reception, Tommy and I approached Amy and her new husband to congratulate them. She gave us the coldest look and awkward hugs before blowing us off. Tommy and I were confused and a little offended by her reaction. I tried to talk to her a few times during the reception, but she avoided me. I figured she had a lot going on and let it go. I called her a few days later, raving about the wedding and how gorgeous she looked. I never heard from her again, not even a thank you card for my gift.A few months later, I ran into Lisa. After a quick catch-up, I asked about Amy. Evidently, Amy was telling everyone how I deliberately tried to ruin her wedding by bringing one of her ex-boyfriends as a date because I was jealous. Lisa stood up for me, but Amy didn’t want to hear it. I called Amy, but it went to voicemail. I left a message and apologized, stating that I didn’t think bringing Tommy was a problem because they dated for TWO MONTHS back in HIGH SCHOOL. I reminded her that she and him were friends after the breakup. I honestly didn’t think she’d even remember him. She never responded.Here’s where I’m wondering AITA. I have run into Amy a handful of times over the years. Each time, she’d get upset about how I brought Tommy to her wedding. I’d apologize again and explain my intention. It has now been fifteen years since that fateful day and six years since I saw her last. I ran into her last week and was hit with a bitter, “You know, after all these years, I still can’t understand why you did that to me.” It was as if I had never apologized or explained myself any of the other times. She’s still married to the same guy and has a couple of kids, but she can’t seem to get past it. Seriously, AITA and just not seeing it?",

But right after he said he was joking.I wanted to give the PS4 to my boyfriend since he recently sold his Xbox and is wanting a new console. I brushed what he said off but it wasn’t until after I stopped playing the game and laid down that he emphasized that he was joking. I kept telling him we shook on it, we shook on it but his response was “I was joking.” Everytime.About 45 minutes to an hour ago, we were downstairs talking about it and he kept saying I couldn’t have it and he was joking. In my mind this is like going to get a new car and shaking hands with the dealer after doing business. Once you’ve signed everything can the dealer just say “nevermind I actually like this car you can’t have it” I actually told him if he did this I wouldn’t talk to him anymore and he asked if it was forever which I replied to until I felt like it. Then he went to his room upstairs and cried. It just doesn’t make sense to me.AITA? Do I have a right to be upset or am I being overdramatic?EDIT: okay I get it- I’m the asshole here I’ll apologize to him in the morning  also the comments about my age >_> nah I don’t trust yall like that rn smh I’m not that much older than him but I do get yalls point thanks :)",

	"title" : "AITA for asking my mom not to smoke with our cats on the balcony and making her cry?",
	"body" : "I 22nb and my mother 48f live in a small apartment with 2 balconies, one in her room one on mine (it’s very small tho and we use it for storage, but there is space there). We have 4 rescued young cats, who I absolutely adore and she says she loves them too. Out cats really love to play and sleep on her balcony. She smokes on her balcony and I asked her so many times to get the cats out of there if she’s smoking, or ask me to get them to get to my balcony to smoke.I asked A LOT of times, because it’s so important for me that our cats are healthy, and them being near while she smokes can result in some bad health problems for them. I explained to her every time that it hurts the cats, and that she should not smoke with them there, she was either dismissive like “oh nothing is going to happen it’s fine” or promised me to get them out while she smokes. And she doesn’t. She doesn’t call me to get them either. Two days ago this happened again and I was so hurt not only by her basically not listening to me, but also because it’s like she doesn’t care about our cats and me. I strategically raised my voice and seemed angry, because she just doesn’t listen otherwise, she covered her ears and said stop it multiple times, I didn’t scream, but yes I was loud and annoyed and pleaded with her to stop smoking with them there. She once again promise she’d stop.Today, less than half an hour ago this happened again, she literally could’ve just called me to get them out, but no. I once again looking quite angry and with a raised voice told her to stop doing this, believe me I don’t want to yell but I did because I’m so hurt and tired of her not listening. She once again covered her ears, said stop and most of the time ignored all of my questions like “You don’t care about me or what I ask, why? You don’t care if our cats get sick? Why didn’t you just ask me to move them?” She just ignored me and I went back to my room, and she started crying. I tried to ignore it but later came to her to explain myself more calmly, but she once again just ignored me.It felt like she was a kid who made a mistake and I’m her parent, and it’s always like this with many problems. I want to have a normal, calm conversation with her where she actually listens to me and my worries, but she doesn’t. Her reaction feels so manipulative to make herself like she’s a victim, while I was never heard and ignored. I don’t understand how to talk with her…why can’t she just ask me to get the cats out? I care about them sm and she can’t even do such a small thing…I know she’s manipulating, but I still feel like such an asshole for making her cry, AITA? How can I make her listen?Also english is not my native language",

	"body" : "So my (25F) friend (24F) is 7 months pregnant. I've known her since we were kids and I know her likes and dislikes and she has very similar taste to me with regards to a lot of things, so when I found out she was pregnant I offered to plan her baby shower for her.Now as much as I love my friend, I cannot stand her boyfriend (M26) and do everything I can to support her whilst avoiding him. I personally believe he's a toxic person and he definitely has some abusive traits that my friend can't see. I have encouraged her to leave him before, but she always shuts down my concerns and tells me I don't understand their relationship. So when she became pregnant, I was extremely happy for her since I knew how much she wanted to be a mother, but also worried about him being the man that impregnanted her. Still, I've tried to support her as much as I can so that she has someone to fall back on when her relationship ends.Yesterday I was discussing all the details with her about what she wants so that I can work on hiring decor, organising catering, cakes etc in time for her shower. To my dismay, she told me that she actually wanted one big co-ed baby shower so that her partner and his friends could celebrate too, and she started listing things that he had seen online and liked. I told her I thought it was a bad idea to include him, and that something more traditional was probably better. She insisted that her boyfriend be involved, because it is his baby as much as hers.I suggested two separate baby showers, one with her female family and friends that I would plan, and then a separate co-ed one with her partner and his friends/their partners. She told me she would be too tired for two baby showers, and that since I offered to plan it for her I should be willing to accomodate her wants.I reinforced again that I refused to plan anything that involved her boyfriend and that if she didn't like that then she can plan it herself or find someone else to help her plan it. She said that I shouldn't have offered to plan it if I was going to let my selfishness and own personal bias get in the way of what she wants. But I'm only trying to protect her and ensure that this moment is something she can look back on in the future with joy, rather then having it ruined by her abusive boyfriend being there. AITA?",

I didn't think we were compatible, but we could be friends instead.She just uh gave off misandrist vibes and I have no interest in dating a misandrist. She admits to being a bit of a misandrist, so I guess at least she owns it?My best friend, Chris, is dating someone that I knew he wasn't really compatible with. They weren't compatible in bed, but also, they are two very different kind of people. He loves to party and go out, she hates to leave the house.We're all in college and they met because they're roommates. I also live with them. It's an apartment affiliated with the campus, so it's different from normal apartments. You don't play bills, for one, but also your roommate not paying the rent doesn't affect you, so you won't get evicted, only they will.But yeah, Chris wasn't happy and ended up break up with her after several conversations.There was a lot of crying, etc. I went to talk to go talk to her, ex gf, since we were friends/roommates. Mari was there, which is strange because they're not friends & she doesn't live here. She was telling her that her ex was a giant asshole, and she shouldn't have to live with him.I talked to her and sympathized. I said I'm sorry she was going through a hard time, what do you want us to do. Chris's ex said she wanted to move out, and for him to pay her rent. I said that wasn't realistic we're all college students. He paid his rent through loans like her. But we'll talk to the RA, come up with a strategy.Mari said my bff should be the one to leave, he's a dick, etc and he broke up with her. I said we could ask about it.The ex-gf ended up leaving the room to call the RA, and I told Mari that he didn't do anything wrong. They weren't compatible. She's just sad, which is fair. Mari said yes, he did. It's not okay to break up with someone over sex, only men do that. I said that's not the only reason he broke up with her, but if it was, there's nothing wrong with it. My bff, Gen, would break up with a guy if they were sexually incompatible. It's not a \"man thing.\"But she said she doesn't know any woman who would do that and I was wrong. She said my bff probably purposely decided to move in with gf, so he could have her trapped.I said he didn't even know her before they moved in together. He didn't do this on purpose.What really threw me off is that ex-gf came back and said she talked to RA and they have no free rooms. She has to live here. Mari said if that's true, you should make his life a living hell for the rest of the 6 months you're living here. It's his fault for breaking up with you, you should torture him for it.My mouth dropped. I answered before I could stop myself, I said, \"wtf, that's fucking psycho, what is wrong with you. You're making everything worse.\"This turned into a big fight where she screamed at me for calling her psycho and I just ended up leaving. AITA?",

	"body" : "Howdy, fellow Redditors! I've (F32) got a daycare tale that's got me mulling over whether I might be in the wrong here. I'm a momma to a precious 16-month-old, and he's got some adorable mixed-race features. My husband is from an Asian country, and our little baby has a beautiful slightly tanned skin and amazing Asian features with some really big eyes. Now, few days ago, I found myself in a bit of a situation with an old gamma of another kid – let's call her Granny Gossip (GG) – and I need your opinions on this one.GG has made a few comments before about how \"exotic\" and \"beautiful\" my baby is. I don’t mind those comments because he is really cute, and by now, I’m used to hearing those. I often just agree and move on with whatever I’m doing. But lately, she is starting to feel a bit much.The issue started last week. I'm picking up my little one when GG strikes up a friendly chat… fine so far. The teacher comes and puts my son on the floor so he can walk towards me. Suddenly, GG gets in front of me and makes signals for my baby to go to her. I was shocked at first, but I gently pushed her a bit aside and picked up my kid. She appeared to be annoyed, but I shut down any attempts of complaint by cordially, but firmly, stating that I was the mother and she has no business doing what she just did.Fast forward to this week, and guess what? GG is at it again, making comments about my baby's looks, but after last week’s incident, I didn’t entertain her at all. When my kid comes, anyone would have thought that she got the message, but it seems like she missed the memo. This time, I wasn't as polite – I walked right up to her, and I admit that I said some choice words, along with a clear message that my son has nothing to do with her. She's not the mother nor the grandma, and she has absolutely no business trying to attract the attention of my kid like that, even more in front of me.Some might say I'm being oversensitive, but I reckon it's my right as a momma to set some boundaries. My husband is with me, but he thinks that I could have handled things better. Also, I have seen other parents giving me a judgmental look. So, AITA for telling GG to back off and let my baby arc himself towards his momma, not towards her?",

I grew up in poverty, single parent and etc. My friend Freddy and Ollie also grew up in poverty or lower middle class. Charlie on the over hand did not, his family went to Germany regularly(and still does..), has a multiple story house, has a in home cleaning service, and his family is very well off where sometimes it feels unreal.Well myself, Freddy, Ollie and Charlie were laughing and Ollie brought a meme about being poor. Something about using a bread slice has a bun. Which doesn’t classify has a broke thing, but was just what helped lead the conversation on.Ollie, Freddy and I all shared funny and interesting stories about our youth. Recounting how sometimes the electricity was turned off so we used bundled in blankets, how going out was only saved for special events once a year and etc.Even though the memories were bitter, we three had a good time just recounting and seeing how similar upbringings we shared. While this went on for 30 minutes Charlie chimed in. I know his family has always been well off but I listened.He explained he knew what we meant, how one summer they couldn’t use their in ground pool and had to use the public one. Now not saying having a pool is “rich” or “privileged” but it’s definitely an expensive investment.The three of us fell silent and the other side did not say much. I tried to joke about and say “sorry never had a pool, I ain’t rich”. Charlie frowned and asked what I meant by that. I explained it wasn’t something we could relate to, I planned on shrugging it off after that.I guess my joke sent charlie into a rant about how he wasn’t rich, how he was also lower middle glass and I was a jerk for even suggesting he was rich. I was getting fed up at this point and stated that his house had a full living room sized room filled with expensive things and liquor, and there was nothing wrong with being rich.Charlie didn’t let it go and claimed I was being privileged because I have on brand clothing. I work 50 hours every paycheck, working since 15 and a full time student and are saving to send my mother into retirement early but wanted to splurge since the holidays.I was getting angry and told him to leave, saying I was not going to tolerate this.

Steve has two kids - “Jane” (24f) and “Nate” (26m). Jane and I have been best friends most of our lives, while Nate and I have never got along. As old as we are, we get “revertigo” around each other, and tend to bicker over stupid things. I’m not proud of it, because i am generally a calm person and I take a laissez faire approach to life and conflict, but there’s something about Nate that just irritates me, and he’s the same. Both super calm people, we just can’t stand each other.Me and my boyfriend “Eric” (26m) were staying with my dad and his wife over Christmas, and Steve (who has a house nearby) was hosting Jane and her family, and Nate, so we all had a Boxing Day meal together. After lunch, Jane, her husband, Nate, Eric and I were sitting in the den, when Nate made a snide comment about me. I fired back and we got into an argument. It got quite heated, but it was still just childish insults.During the argument, Nate called me an idiot, and Eric snapped back that he shouldn’t talk to me like that and called Nate uneducated (technically true but an incredibly nasty and below the belt thing to say, given context). I told Eric to butt out of the argument, which kind of fizzled out after his comment.That evening, we got into a fight about it, because I was embarrassed about what he said, and how he waded into the conversation. Eric said he felt like he had to defend me and was very offended by what Nate said. I told him what Nate said wasn’t a big deal, but him commenting on the education level of someone he doesn’t know, when he wasn’t even involved in the argument, was unnecessary. I don’t need defending, not from him and not like that.Eric is still sulking about it and making passive aggressive comments about how he  doesn’t want to do anything for me because I clearly don’t need him.

	"body" : "My (28f) maternal uncle (65m, turning 66 literally tomorrow) was a civilian scientist working for the USAF. And he is such an awesome guy. My own biological father abandoned me and my mother when I was very young (more than 25 years ago), and my uncle has stepped in and provided financial assistance to us ever since the early days of my mother being a single mom. This was convenient, because my uncle is single and childless. Not only has he helped us out financially, but he’s always been a mentor and a father figure to me. He IS my dad. My mother and I couldn’t have made it without him, and I am indebted to him.With all that being said…my uncle has retired from the federal government in the summer this year, after 21 years of service. He has a full government pension and retirement benefits. He is the rhythm guitarist/occasional keyboardist for a semi-professional band that he formed with his old grad school classmates. They play music as hard as Iron-Maiden-esque metal, and as soft as jazz fusion, and they’ve been going strong for the past 30 years now! Earlier this month, when my uncle was visiting my mother and I for dinner, he mentioned to us that the main reason he retired was to devote more of his time to music. It wasn’t a secondary reason, but it was his #1 reason. He has no aspirations or expectations of making it big. But his band is regionally popular, so he enjoys playing plenty of shows and local fairs. Also, he can definitely financially afford to spend the rest of his days happily playing the guitar and relaxing.Nevertheless, my first thought was “….seriously?” I told my uncle that, at nearly the age of 66, he's too old to be “having fun” for the rest of his 30+ yr life. He just laughed, and he let me know that if he can afford to retire and enjoy himself in the twilight years of his life……..then why not?I just feel like the world is missing out on my uncle’s scientific expertise and talent.

He asked me to organise a party for him that is taking place at the end of January, and it was has been a Herculean task (huge guest list, lots of coordination, etc.) and pretty stressful.I was talking about this to my boyfriend, “Marty”, who has seen me doing all this planning, and he asked if there was anything he could do to make the whole thing less stressful. I said that if he felt okay about it, he could not attend the party.The background to this is that Marty doesn’t get along with my family very well. Not for any deep reasons, and no one is disrespectful about it, but he doesn’t like them and they don’t like him. Marty is a sweet, sensitive guy, very kind and a people pleaser, whereas my family values bluntness, ambition, and a strong character. They all find Marty a bit disappointing as partner for me and he feels that they’re cold. Everyone is civil, but it’s just not comfortable for me to have to bridge the gap all the time. Marty is also quite socially anxious, especially at “fancy” events, so he’ll likely be a bit clingy at the party while I have to play host, alongside Kai. I love Marty, but all in all, this is an event where I could do with having one less thing in my plate.Marty was very angry that I asked him not to come, and said I was pandering to my family and he can’t believe I’d rather not have him there. He’s now not really speaking to me.I think it’s unfair that he’s sulking this much over a simple request, even when I accepted his refusal. I understand if he feels like he needs to be there to make a point, I’m not uninviting him, but I also don’t think I was wrong to pose it as a suggestion, because it really would help me have an easier night.I wouldn’t have asked him not to come if this was a holiday, or something important/that he would enjoy as well, but this party is a chore for him and really not a thing that impacts his life so I didn’t think it would be a big deal if he didn’t go.AITA for asking that of him at all?",

I also like to sleep in (sometimes until 1130am) when I'm on a weekend or break (like today). He wakes up everyday around 8am. I really don't like getting up early and any day I can get to sleep in, I try to.Today we had my families Christmas to do around 1pm. We did originally have something to do in the morning but it got moved to tomorrow. So, my alarm went off at 8, I found out the thing to do got moved to tomorrow. He normally is awake before me and just play games on his phone, which is the case today too. I asked if he was cool if I sleep in until 8:30 then and he said sure. However, at 8:27 he got out of bed in a huff. I think he thought I didn't set another alarm or something even though I did have another alarm for 8:30. After he gets out of bed I'm pretty well awake but I don't want to get up and be around him because I thought he'd be grumpy and so I stayed I'm bed until 9, he thought I was sleeping the whole time.I get up and start making breakfast among another small morning task that he ignored in his frustration. I was just trying to play it cool and then he started getting mad and letting me know how upset he was that I didn't get up exactly when I said. I should also note that I asked if he was hungry, he said not really. I asked if there was anything else he wanted to do with me, he said no and he just wanted to play games and get the day started (please note gaming is not the issue here) and take some time to relax before spending the day with my family. I didn't understand why he was so upset at me for staying in bed a bit longer if there was no real reason for me to rush out of bed. He swears he wouldn't have been mad if I got out of bed when I said and that he was upset that I said I was going to do something and didn't immediately do it. I told him I thought it was controlling to ask me to get out of bed exactly when he desired and that I thought he'd be upset either way. This led to a nearly marriage ending fight.Also, I want to add that when it is my turn to make meals I sometimes make it an hour later than he asks when I'm doing school work which leads him to be very hungry. I have gotten to sleep in some days on my break already. Even this week I slept until noon and didn't make breakfast until then and he feels resentful, feeling like he had to wait 4 hours for food and so he doesn't feel like I'm holding up to my part of the food making deal because he wakes up every day of the week to make food for me before school at 8. Finally, sometimes when he asks me to do something I get snappy because I have issues with being told to do something (I always end up doing it though). Because of these situations, he is resentful which plays a big part in this fight.Long story short, title.So, AITA?",

I should note we are in college and live across the street from each other. Well I think a lot of it and try to ignore it.

I was upset because she told me these exact words “you were my best person” “it’s gonna be a whole to move on from you and I’m gonna take a break from dating” so I was very upset bc I felt betrayed and lied to. Then things got worse after I found out they were together I tried to ignore her a lot. Then she snapped me saying “how would you feel if I told you I was talking to someone” I was upset but said “I wouldn’t give a flying fk” she said “jeez alr well he has a thing about me talking to my exs” one thing to note is when we were together and I had an issue with it and she didn’t unadd her exs for me. While I was upset I kept cool and said “ok and?” She proceeded to call me an ahole and say “I just wanted to let you know I’m unadding you and you can still text my number bc I care about you. I said “I’m not being an asshole and ok” and unadded her first.This is where the fun begins. I found out her and her new man are being intimate. The issues at hand are. He’s 17 and she is about to be 21 soon. Which ok wtv but however our relationship she never wanted any kind of intimacy and she said she wanted to wait til marriage. Now this is my fault bc she told me “I’ve had intimacy with all my other relationships and want to wait bc sx ruins relationships” which I said ok which was stupid of me.

My pronouns are they/them but honestly I don't care if I'm refered to with she/her pronouns because most people in my family didn't grow up like that so they aren't too educated.What got me is that my dad said \"Well, on your birth certificate, your name is [deadname], so that's what we're going to call you. We have wishes that you need to respect, and we'll respect yours.

And it would be our first trip after our last child was born.He and I don't have family nearby or trusted friends (we recently moved) and having a babysitter 24 hours a day for 2 days is very expensive, so it wouldn't be possible for the two of us to spend it together.I tried to explain that I really needed a break, because our children were on vacation and having 3 children, one of them a baby, is very difficult since I worked from home.He's really upset with me, I haven't booked the hotel yet, but I'm feeling lost.AITA?",

She was in college but got pregnant and now she's living at home with me again.She's nearing her fifth month now. So the problem we had is that her breasts are very obviously growing. She was a cup c (sometimes b) before, now her biggest bras are starting to feel too tight on her. Well, I recommended her to buy some new bras and she got some d cup that somewhat fit her (some are a little bigger but we'd figure that was better so she wasn't as uncomfortable, plus her breasts will probably keep growing a little more)Well, the thing is that she changed her bra size, but she's still wearing her same old shirts. Some of them are fine, but some of them show too much. Sometimes she wears tank tops or shirts that have all of her cleavage uncovered. And I mean, that's fine when we're home since it's only us, but she wears them out sometimes.So I advised her to wear her more modest shirts and I told her we could buy some extra more \"mommy style\" shirts, not only because her normal shirts will get ruined if she continues to wear them (too stretched) but also because she's a grown up woman now and needs to dress more accordingly.She told me off, said she'll dress up however she wants and to stop trying to tell her what to do all the time. I told her I was trying to help her mature because she'll need it soon, she can't dress up like she's going to a party everyday, especially not now that she's about to be a mother.Well she told me to stop \"bitching\", said it's hot and she wants to wear the clothes she likes, not dressing like an old lady. I asked her if she thought this was a game? Because she doesn't seem to maturing at all, she told me that I'm always telling her what to do and she's sick of it, so I told her that if she's sick she could easily leave and be responsible for her actions.Well, we're both angry now. I told her that I'm helping her out of the kindness of my heart, so she should listen to what I'm saying or leave. She went crying to her father and he called me telling me off too and saying I should let her be and dress up however she wants. Am I an asshole for this?",

The 2 younger kids often say that I am their favourite uncle and they enjoy spending time and playing with me. They listen to what I ask of them and are well-behaved around me. Obviously they are still kids and do stupid things, but overall I enjoy spending time with them. All that while I'm literally fed-up with the eldest kid. He never listens and always talks back to me (to his parents too but to lesser extent). Also since day one that I arrived at their place he keeps on disrespecting my privacy- looks through my things behind my back, peaks over my shoulder at my laptop/phone and comments it, tries to play paparazzo shooting photos of me etc. And I mean constantly. I've never yelled at him for that, but was very annoyed with his behaviour and told him countless times.Also very important detail to add is that I smoke cigarettes, the fact which my family condemns very strong and tries to shame me for it all the time even tho I'm 30 and soon a physician so I know what I'm doing lol.Neither my sister nor my brother-in-law made any serious attempts to stop his doing. Sure they did tell him sometimes to stop but never really did anything to make it happen. So his behaviour stays the same. After he looks through my things and finds my cigarettes or sees that I'm on my phone scrolling instagram or sth equally stupid he yells that loud, sends photos on our family chat etc. And while it doesn't do any serious harm it's constant and very annoying.So today he has done all of that again several times, and after the last time he was peaking over my shoulder I yelled at him to stop. And while I know he's just a kid etc. I stand to repeat that it's very annoying and his parents not doing anything with that is just infuriating. Obviously he started talking back to me, after sometime my sister joined bashing me for yelling at her kid.A big argument ensued with both of us saying mean things, on my part it was centered around not respecting myself and my privacy by her, her kid and whole family in general. Between many things said she told me that's her house and rules and I can't treat her kid like that. That I shouldn't be mad and arguing with the kid because I'm an adult etc.So AITA for getting mad and yelling at/arguing with her and the kid?",

Today I stop, I let my dogs out. I am an accountant & it’s year end & I have been working for 12 hours straight. I still had a 2 hour drive up to my parents house. I wanted them to have time outside. I walk in & her dogs hear me and start barking (the aggressive one typically bites me when I come over) I hear my sis say let’s go outside. I yell that my dogs were outside. It was too late her dog had mine by the neck. Luckily my dog is a large mix who can stand her own until my sis was able to gain control. I realized we both had made mistakes. she went off on me. Saying I didn’t have permission to let my dogs in her yard & stated I set her dog up for failure.  me yelling that my dogs were outside was a “poor excuse.” So she was allowed to be mad at me & kept yelling at me as if my dog had attacked hers. I was tired annoyed & my dog that was hurt I did lose my temper at this point & called her a c***.  I have since apologized for. this is not the 1st time she has attacked me like this. This is just the straw that broke the camel’s back. My fam walks on eggshells around her and she treats all of us, esp our mom, like crap. (Norm the cause of our fights.) ex: my mom is an animal lover but is terrified of my sis dog, (it has tried to bite her) my sis has already set a boundary that my mom is not allowed to say anything negative about her dog or she will be kicked out of their house when my mom goes to help with their bby.My whole fam says things like “it’s your sister you have to go.” “Give her a break it’s her hormones” or “you know how she is” my mom said I don’t have a choice I have to be there. I’m tired of those being the only reasons I have to go to her events.  WIBTA if I don’t go to the baby shower?",

Ok, so I(25 NB) am still living with my parents(M 62 and F 61). My parents have never really shown me a lot of care and compassion growing up and I can tell that they treated my twin brother(M 25) much better from any early age, and it caused me to grow up bitter and angry. Aside from my bad attitude, I struggled a lot with mental health issues like depression, anxiety and possibly autism, and since my parents were already fed up with me, they turned to spankings and yelling to essentially train me to be seen and not heard. Now, I’m older, braver and a lot louder than I was as a kid, but of course, I still fear my parents’ judgment, especially when it comes to my sexuality and gender identity. I’ve told my parents that I was a lesbian when I was 8, and my mom cursed me out and told me to get out of her face. Fast forward 8 more years, I came out again and they both weren’t super thrilled, but it didn’t seem to bother them as much. I’ve never told them that I’m nonbinary, because they’re kinda transphobic and constantly misgender and say mean things about trans people, including those in our family. I’ve always struggled with my gender, but I can confidently say that I would feel much happier living with more masculine features. I’m scared to tell them because I feel like they’re just gonna scream at me and tell me how I need to “stay off the internet” and “get outside and not be cooped up in my room all day,” but this is how I truly feel. I only have my three friends who provide me support, however, my best friend has been my ride-or-die. She’s stuck by side through out this entire journey and I could never thank her enough for loving me and being there for me. Back to my parents though, AITA if I don’t tell them more about myself?

However I have bent over backwards trying to make xmas special for my DH and our 2 boys. I planned since September, buying and wrapping ALL presents for both kids, and thinking about what DH would really like for Xmas too. At 1 point he mentioned he was short on loungewear tops, so I trawled the internet to order 5 different ones so he’d have a choice. I got him some personalised football gifts and other stuff I thought he’d really like.Around Sep, I mentioned that if he was looking for something for me for Xmas , I really needed button down pjs for when baby arrives as I will be breastfeeding. I mentioned a few other things I liked… a bracelet, and a pair of shoes… but told him the main thing I needed was pjs suitable for feeding baby.On Xmas morning I opened a few gifts from him but couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed. Of the 12 things there, he’d got me around 7 things of sweets including some licqures- which I can’t have coz of the gestational diabetes and pregnancy. I received one single button up pyjama top-with no bottoms- that is a size too small from what I normally wear. He said he struggled to find anything that buttoned up in my size, however I’d been pointing out ones in my size since Sep and there’s the whole world of internet shopping at his fingertips…I guess I feel a bit like he didn’t put much thought or effort into my gifts but I don’t know if I’m being really unreasonable?He does try to be supportive most of the time and ended up cooking most of xmas dinner by himself as I felt really rough (though I’d prepared all veg the night before while he wrapped my gifts) I do often feel like he doesn’t listen when I tell him something or will deliberately “misunderstand” if something doesn’t suit him. (Eg I told him back in Nov that I didn’t think I’d manage to go to in-laws this year and asked him to invite them to ours instead. He didn’t do this and on xmas day he revealed they’d planned on us being there and had bought food for us too. When I reminded him I said I didn’t think I’d manage at 8 months pregnant in their overcrowded house he said he thought I would just have coped and it would be fine… he later apologised to me, saying he’d misunderstood and we made alternative arrangements with in laws, but it made me feel bad.I have tried to let these things go the past couple of days but it’s kind of niggling away at me. I am wondering whether I should try to tell him how I am feeling but am worried that i might be sounding really ungrateful and unappreciative.WIBTA if I tell him that I don’t feel he put much thought or effort into my Christmas?",

As we headed to the exit we stopped for the restroom and a diaper change.The exit level has 1 family restroom with a toilet and a diaper change station, a women’s restroom with 6 stalls and no diaper change stations, and a men’s room also with no diaper change stations.We’ve been on other occasions and I’ve waited in lines for the family restroom before, as well as lines within the women’s restroom.As I approached, my husband was still a little behind me with our toddler, and there was no one waiting at the family room, so I headed inside alone and did my business, and texted my husband to bring our girl to the door so I could change her after I was finished.As I was washing my hands, I could hear a female voice outside saying something like “I saw her go in, it’s just a single lady”.I opened the door, saw my husband, beckoned to him to bring our daughter over, and she ran inside to me. As she came over, a woman standing right outside the door holding a baby said, “Seriously! We’ve been waiting!”I replied, “I understand, I’ve waited too, we’ll be done soon.”She called me a rude name, and I said “we’re all just doing the best for our families, I’m trying to be quick.”I closed the door and changed my toddler, not making it take any longer than necessary. While we were inside, I could hear the woman continuing to comment on how selfish and ignorant she thought I was being. As we walked out, she again called me a rude name. I walked straight out without commenting or making eye contact.I thought I was being efficient by going in first, and I don’t realistically think it took any longer than if my daughter and I had been inside together the whole time. I can see the view that we had “two turns” inside while another family was waiting. Maybe I should have used the women’s room myself, then waited to separately use the family room just for the diaper change, but that simply seemed like an unnecessary extra step at the time. Since I was carrying the diaper bag, my husband couldn’t have changed her simultaneously unless we had switched in advance and, again, it didn’t occur to me since I knew my daughter and I could both use the family restroom. I guess I could have waited at the family restroom for them to catch up and not gone in until we were together, I just thought in the moment since I was a bit ahead that I would be faster to just go myself first, instead of waiting for her to enter the room together.AITA?",

So I assume that would mean he would get home 5:15 to 5:30, right? I guess not because he consistently gets home 6 or later most days. Today I got off early. I was excited because we have no days off together and this meant we would have a little more evening time, assuming he was off at 5 like her keeps saying. I got home at 5:30 only to find out he was still at work. So I called and asked what time he was off. He flipped out and said 5. I said then why are you still at work? He said because he has to close the office, pick up stuff, close the gate, etc. I said then you're still working, so when are you off so I know when you'll be home? I was looking for a answer that would set up realistic expectations going forward. Like \"I have to do x, y, and z but I can't do that until 5 so 5:30 is a more realistic time to say I'm off.\" Pretty much we argued back and forth for a minute with me insisting if he's off at 5 then it's not crazy to expect him home by 5:30 and him arguing that he is off at 5 and he's just locking up for 30 min to an hour. He then asked me if I'm off 6 why I don't get home until 7. I said because my commute is an hour, but I still leave at six.  He keeps insisting this is the same logic. He ended up getting home at 6 and has been ignoring me for an hour and a half because he's busy with his game and insists I need to apologize for asking him what time he is off again. Which I did, and tried to explain that I keep expecting him home based off what he told me and keep getting disappointed. Which just started another argument.So AITA for thinking he should be home 15 to 30 min after he's \"off.\" I could be because maybe I should have just asked what time he was getting home instead of what time he is off again. I'm just tired of being told one thing and then something else happening.Edit: Phew... A lot of you are weirdly triggered by this.  I can see how my post comes across as me being wildly unhinged but I wasn't even the slightest bit upset until he blew up at me when my intention was to just figure out what was going on and I did not do a good job of communicating that to him.Regardless, I apologized for asking him what time he was off hours ago and for not understanding that he had a completely different interpretation of the question than I did. I kept all attempts to explain where I was coming from to myself. And because I have not attempted to talk out the miscommunication  again he is happily talking to me instead of ignoring me.",

	"body" : "I (26F) am a white American engaged to an Indian man (32M). I met my fiancé two years ago, and we started dating privately, as I wanted to protect him from my family. My dad (66M) is a sporty and loving guy whom I've always had a close relationship with. On the other hand, my mother (50F) and I have always had a turbulent relationship: I've always felt her pressure me to achieve academic success. I also related closely to the 'almond mom' stereotype – all my life she has insisted I try different diets, which pushed us apart. I moved out of the house at 19, and we got along a bit better for a while.However, when I was 21 years old, she started to nag about grandchildren. She has explicitly described her dream about my future family. Around that time I also realized how racist she is. Clearly her vision for her son-in-law is a blue-eyed Aryan or something like that. Only men with paper-like skin color seem to be good enough for continuing her bloodline! This is why I wanted to keep my fiancé a secret.Recently my mother started to send me lists of \"adorable\" baby names, reminding me of the fact that I'm not enough for her. Understandably, my fiancé wasn't pleased that I couldn't introduce him to my family, as he had done with his. I tried to explain that my mother wouldn't approve of him because of his skin color, but he insisted we'd go for at least a small visit. After weeks of fighting, I finally gave in and decided to go see my parents at a restaurant.We met them yesterday. As soon as my mother laid eyes on my fiancé, she visibly tensed up. She was not prepared to see a brown man, as I had only mentioned his American-sounding name earlier. During dinner, she was blabbering nonsense about stuff she doesn't normally talk about and looked uncomfortable. She ordered only an appetizer for herself, and just poked it while staring at her napkin. The irritation of all those years started to build up inside me, as I watched her efficiently ignore my fiancé and talk about the weather for the whole dinner. I thought to myself disdainfully, \"why isn't she asking about the grandchildren\"? So, in the heat of the moment, I burst out with \"We're pregnant\". She just sat in silence for a long time and looked at me. Finally, my dad stood up and basically dragged her out, saying they'd better get going. Upon leaving, he whispered \"congratulations\".After they left, my fiancé looked bewildered and asked what I was talking about. In actuality, I'm not pregnant and wasn't planning on getting in the near future. He was furious that I'd lied to him and my parents, although I tried to explain all the racism, microaggressions and other things from my childhood that made me blow up like that. He replied saying that he didn't notice any of that during the dinner and said that I can't define racism for him. To me, my mom's behaviour was clearly caused by my fiancé's looks, but he can't understand this. After that, we haven't talked.",

	"body" : "So something happened yesterday. I (f32) am the mother of my two children, and my current SIL Syph (f29) is a mom of 3. The 8 of us (humans and their golden rateater Sparlke) went hiking in the woods to spend the holiday. Syph has been going through a messy divorce with my lowlife brother, so I suggested we do something fun with all our kids. I thought it'd be a nice idea to get her mind off the divorce, and to see my nieces and nephew one last time, because once she and my brother finish their legal blech, I KNOW she's getting full custody and moving far far away.Anyways, we decided a hiking trip would be reasonable because it's only been in the low 20s these days, so not too chilly. We set out on our five-mile scenic snowy closed-off trail at 10:00 AM, and we had decided that Syph would walk Sparlke and I would supervise all the kids. For clarity, my kids are Jordon (f11) and Horton (m9), and Syph's are Mundane (m8), Mei (f6), and Mie (f6).Everything was alright at first, but my kids are much weller behaved than Syph's. Maybe it's because their parents are divorcing, but they were arguing over unintelligible things and throwing brown snowballs at each other and MY kids for the entire first mile. I let Syph go on ahead with Sparlke so she wouldn't have to hear their nonsense.A bit later, Mundane asked me if he could go off the trail to find better snow to throw at Jordon and Horton. WOW. I wasn't thrilled by the idea but I told him ok just don't go too far off. About 10 minutes later, I'd totally forgotten about him and then I realized I totally forgotten about him. We'd walked over a mile since where he ran off, and he never came back. Syph and Sparlke were still well ahead of me and the remaining kids, so I decided that I'd just hope Mundane would find his way back to the unmarked trail before we caught up to his mom.Well, 25 minutes later we met back up with Syph and Sparlke. Syph demanded to know where her son was, so I confessed that he stupidly ran off but didn't come back like I told him to. Syph looked like she could puke and tried dialing 911, but there was no signal in this uncharted wood. All that was left to do was throw a search party. Now, Syph had the dog and all of the kids since she didn't trust me with them, even my own kids. WOW, rude.Pretty soon though, I spotted Mundane sitting/crying under a tree. Maybe it was because Syph's attitude was getting to me, but I went over to Syph and told her \"I don't know how to say this, but I saw part of Mundane down there.\" Syph again looked ready to puke so I immediately followed up with \"Just kidding he's ok!\" I thought she'd be relieved and happy, but she actually threw up and it was so gross. Mei or Mie stepped in it. The, again 8, of us silently went back to the end of the trail, went away in our two cars, and now as I understand, Syph and my brother are bonding over their mutual hatred for ME.

At the time, me and my husband couldn’t support her at the dream school as we had crazy overhead costs. We did contribute what we can, but asked Annie to work part time.Even after the financial aid, Annie worked a job to go towards her rent and this has meant her studies suffered. She had to defer some of her classes to sit them in the summer. She has now since graduated and landed a good job.Ben wasn’t fussed about where he got into and he did well at high school, and got a full ride scholarship, so we didn’t pay for his tuition. Occasionally I sent him money to spend on himself.Cal is my youngest and as its been a few years since Annie went to college, me and my husband are in a better financial position to support where he wants to go. Cal got many offers and picked his first choice. He was eligible for some financial aid, but the majority will be out of pocket. As we didn’t contribute for Ben’s tuition, we are able to send Cal to a more prestigious school.When Cal announced this news at a family dinner, Annie got upset that Cal gets to go to his dream school and accused us of favourites.

The only problem is I despise the way they play.Say we start a game together that neither of us have played, I take the classic route of learning as we go. I enjoy the mystery and figuring things out for myself and doing it the way I have ever since I’ve started video games. They take the route of researching how to do everything to do with the game, gaining all the knowledge possible and (in my opinion) ruining it for themself. I see it as slightly cheating, because they get a running head-start and then end up taking the lead and doing everything for themself. I really loved Baldur’s Gate until they started telling me where to go and what to do and letting me fall into their knowledge and spoiling everything for me. I ended up just following them around for the entirety of our play through because I felt stupid for not having picked up the knowledge they did.Another thing is modding games. They love to add mods that make the games easier or better for them to play. Adding OP equipment or spells which just makes everything too easy to do.I don’t want to research and they don’t want to go in blind, but I ended up having an argument with them over it and called them a “cheater” for the way they played. They told me to explain how it’s cheating and I said “You don’t get to play the game the way they want you to play. You’d get a lot more out of it for going in blind.” They were very angry about that part, but I genuinely don’t know what to do. Now I feel like an asshole for even bringing it up. They spoil games for me and themselves. It just seems our gaming styles are way too separate.

My bf asked his stepmom to plan it instead, and she did an amazing job I’m beyond grateful she stepped up when she didn’t have to and I’m grateful for everything everyone got for the baby)Yesterday was the baby shower, I was already sad because my dad wasn’t able to attend but I did my best to not let that affect my day. My bfs family showed up and gave him hugs and greeted him. I’m standing right where everyone is coming to say hi to his family but everyone either just gave me an awkward hug or walked by without saying anything. I did my best to brush it off but after 2 hours of no one saying “hi” to me or even trying to make conversation I wanted to cry but there was 2 more hours left that was literally spent of just his family talking to each then last 5 minutes was opening gifts.After the shower was over I tried to tell my bf that I’m upset his family didn’t acknowledge me the whole time, he says they’re just antisocial people and I should have made more of an effort to talk to them. I agree I should have made more of an effort but I tried to say hi to everyone who came and they chose to only talk to him.Again I’m grateful people came, got stuff for the baby, and that my bf got to see his family. I’m upset because I felt excluded. I started balling on the ride home because after I told my bf how I was feeling he says “well I only went for the stuff” and making little comments like “I’m sorry you think my family is trash” “why does everything have to be bad, look at all the stuff we didn’t have to pay for” it got to the point I was sobbing just begging him to stop because I just wanted him to comfort me but it felt like he was rubbing it in that he doesn’t care his family acknowledged him and he kept bringing it back to the stuff.This morning I was scrolling through socials to see pictures of only my bf and his family from the baby shower and it hurts all over again.Now I’m an adult and I’m not going to let how this event went impact how I feel about them because they’re nice people and I made sure I didn’t let my emotions get the best of me during the baby shower so my bf could have fun but AITA for being upset?",

	"body" : "I’ll preface this by saying I am a diagnosed psychopath. Idk if this is relevant but I want honest answers so for full transparency etc etc.So a few of my work buddies took a cruise a few weeks ago to celebrate a huge merger that we basically managed entirely on our own (the 3 of us). Our agreement was my 2 other friends would pay for the cruise ($2100) and I would pay for all drinks. I agreed and figured it was a fair agreement.I had even said it’s no problem if you guys buy a few drinks for girls, like no problem. But here is where the issue lies. My friends didn’t just buy drinks for a few or even 10-15 girls. They literally bought drinks for entire groups of people. For an entire week. This total added up to $5k roughly. Not a single time did they ask or imply this would be the case.Now it’s not breaking the bank to pay this. My issue is my co workers were “ballers” for this entire cruise and I feel taken advantage of. When they asked me to pay this, I told them to get fucked. Like are you kidding. They are saying this was our agreement and I am not living up to it.Maybe I am just weary of people taking advantage of me given my own nature of knowing people behave like this. But I’m just not buying that things got out of hand and this wasn’t intentional.My friend also refused to pay this and it’s going to collections. Now all I hear for days is his credit score his credit score blah blah blah. I really don’t care. But should I just pay this to make it go away? It’s against my principles and them 2 are saying I’m being a huge dick. If that’s the consensus here I’ll pay it. But I just needed some other opinions. Thanks for reading",

She got married on the 6th, which was also the day that I had to attend a really important meeting for my job-as in, if i didnt go i would get fired. I really need this job, as my parents can’t support us and I have no SO to help.

It’s the day that H and I met!M: …oh, uh is there any way to move it?S: why??

This is literally my wedding and you want to miss it for some work meeting?? Im sure B would understandM: you know how B is he would not understand. And its not just “some work meeting” this is a really important one (purposely being vague as someone in my life may see this)After this point she wouldnt respond to my calls, and only responded to my messages with 1 word answers.

In the makeup store, I saw these two boys Liam, who was 10 and Huxton who was 11.Liam was looking for skincare products like Drunk Elephant and retinol/anti-aging creams. I first saw him while in the skincare section and he was messing up the samplers/testers and was making a mess, I told him that he should clean up after he was done and he told me to “fuck off”, I also saw him being rude to an employee who was trying to get him to find a product besides an anti-aging cream.After that, I went along and was looking through other parts of the store, when I saw a group of like six of seven middle school boys near the cologne, I asked them what they were doing and they said they were looking for cologne because girls like that. It was sweet to see and one of the boys said something about how it’s 2024 and how a lot of the boys at their school care more about hygiene and skincare now and how only the “weird nerdy boys” call it “gay” these days. One of the boys who was with them was Huxton, he was wearing some vintage basketball jersey.As I was in line, I ran into Huxton and Liam, they told me their mom was coming with the money for their purchases. Liam was talking to a girl who looked about my age, he asked if she had anti-wrinkle cream and when she said no, he told her “I’d suggest you get it”, I told this kid that wasn’t very nice, Huxton said “Liam, stop”, and tried to apologize for his brother’s behavior, their mom came and paid for the items.Later, I saw them in the food court and I wanted to compliment Huxton for his manners, I went up to him and told him I thought he has good manners and he thanked me. Their mom asked what I was doing and I told her and she said that her kids had great manners.I felt like I had to clarify it was only Huxton who had good manners, she then started to get mad and said “Huxton is 11, Liam is 10, stop expecting them to act the same”, she also accused me of homophobia because Huxton is masculine and Liam is “just a normal gay boy”. She also said  “wait until you have kids” and that I was too young to criticize Liam’s behavior.I’ve been asking my friends if I was in the wrong and my friends don’t agree on an answer. AITA?",

	"body" : "We have been friends for over 2 years now, and lately I started noticing that she (14) doesn't eat as much. She started counting calories like crazy and always jokes that she is fat, and it's only getting worse day by day. She can eat 6 cherry tomatoes and a small lunch a day and that's it.I (15) decided to talk to her and try to understand where all this is coming from to find a solution, and she said it's because she wants to stay the same weight (not gain or lose). I tried to be gentle with her and told her that it wasn't possible because her body is still developing so it's natural for her to gain a little weight, and she got angry. she called me stupid and said that she would just eat less.I got angry too and told her that if she stops eating I will force feed her, and she yelled at me that I have no right to decide what and how much she will eat and that I should mind my own business.I consulted our mutual friends about it and they agreed with her. They said I had no right to threaten to force feed her and that if they were in her place they wouldn't want me to interfere either.I'm very worried because her older sister was also in the same situation and ended up in hospital with Anorexia.AITA?EDIT: Some people misunderstood my intentions and feelings so I added my thoughts.         Plus, obviously the threat was an exaggeration and she is aware of it. We both tend to exaggerate when we're angry (not that it's okay).I used it as a way to convince her to eat, I don't advocate violence of course.Hope that makes more sense now.",

I thought she always looked so sweet and loved the storyline of her being an assassin. I even loved that she gave the final blow to the night king. Since then, I’ve always wanted to name my daughter Arya if I had one.When discussing with my wife (37f) she recalled that her brother (35m) once mentioned he liked the name Aria (with an i) but at the time they only had a son and were not expecting, so I didn’t want to not use the name I’ve always wanted on the off chance that his wife gets pregnant and is a girl. Besides, it’s an extremely common name and they’re different anyways.About 2 months ago we find out that my BIL’s wife is pregnant with their second child and it’s a girl this time. Apparently all the feelings came back rushing to him about us “stealing the name that he’s always wanted to name his daughter” and he completely cut off his life. He will not talk to my wife at all and rejects discussing his feelings about the matter, which makes my wife really really sad over just a name.AITA?",

We have one mutual best friend, Willow (21F), who Daniel went to high school with and I became friends with week 1 of college.A few months ago, we started casually hooking up after a lot of building sexual tension. It was a textbook casual sex scenario, with an added layer of emotional intimacy because of our friendship. When we first started hooking up, he had one condition that he was adamant about: that we don't tell anyone, especially Willow, because according to him, she has always been in his business when it comes to girls and he just \"didn't want to hear it\" from her. I agreed, also wanting to keep things lowkey.Daniel ended things after they grew a little too toxic, and we agreed to stay friends. I had mixed feelings, but was was relieved to finally be able to tell Willow. I Ubered to her place right away and told her, deliberately leaving out anything that made Daniel look too bad. After I left, I got an incredibly angry series of texts from Daniel, accusing me of betraying his trust and that he could not believe that I ran to Willow so quickly. Apparently Willow had called to tease him after I left. I texted Daniel a very long, heartfelt apology explaining how I truly believed that the plan was always to eventually tell Willow after we ended things (although I admit I was hasty with it). He never responded.After two months of not speaking to me, he shows up at my door. After some arguing, he finally admitted that he wanted an apology from me. That he had waited 2 months for me to call him and say I'm sorry and that I never did. I reminded him that I had texted him a very long apology. He said that he read it but wanted a verbal one. I did not think this was a valid reason for unilaterally ending our friendship, especially because how was I supposed to know what he wanted? I accused him of using me for sex and and never caring about our friendship. He accused me of not being genuinely sorry and cold for constantly invalidating his feelings. After more arguing, he left.After speaking to some of my guy friends at home, they told me that I was the asshole. They said that I am not the person who gets to decide what a valid apology looks like when I was the one who committed the wrong. My girls at school (my 3 roommates and Willow) don't think I was in the wrong and that he's overreacting to a miscommunication (and that he's trying to pull off a power play by having me verbally apologize).I can definitely see my guy friends' points but my girls were actually there through it all and maybe have more accurate thoughts on it. Daniel and I are not on speaking terms so should I apologize? Am I the asshole?",

	"body" : "I'm (17f) and have a little sister named Asia (14f)Asia had a bunny called Hay. She did take good care of it, at least from what I can tell. It had a cage that took up an entire wall of our room and chew toys and whatever else rabbits need or like.Anyways, Asia lets it run around in our fenced in backyard. Here comes a big issue.I'm really into gardening and house plants. I keep a couple big leafy plants on my side of our room and I have a mini-garden in our backyard that I'm really proud of because I put so much time and effort into keeping it. My favorite ones are my snap-dragons.So naturally, Hay fucking gets into all my plants. I'm usually able to catch it before it does damage but it ripped an entire leaf off my ficus and whenever Asia lets it outside, guess where it runs straight to. My garden and the little fucker will start digging and messing it up. Once again, usually I chase after it or yell at Asia to get it tf away from my flowers but still it constantly happens and it was so frustrating.A few days ago I was working outside, and Asia was on the other side of the backyard playing with Hay. Our mom calls her in and tells her it's time to leave for her dentist appointment and Asia asks if I minded watching it for a few minutes and then putting it back in it's cage because she was in a hurry. I said fine, and she left.By that point I was pretty dehydrated so I went inside to get a drink and cut up an apple (at that point I was even gonna offer it some) and when I come outside it was digging around and fucking destroying my garden. I screamed and ran over to it and tossed Hay away from my garden. I was sobbing while trying to salvage was was left away from it I couldn't think of anything else.I put in so much effort just to watch it get destroyed in front of me. Some snapdragons and petunias were able to be saved but Hay trampled over a lot and bent their stems. After a while I realized I should probably look for Hay and bring it back inside. I then realized I couldn't find it anywhere. I looked everywhere and panicked but then I realized that there were some gaps under our wooden fence that it could've slipped under and it was too late.When my mom and Asia got home I explained what happened and Asia burst into tears and screamed at me. She asked me why I didn't just bring it inside if I wasn't gonna watch it and I told her I had other thing to worry about since her fucking rabbit destroyed my garden. She cried and said her rabbit was dead now. I said that was dumb because it's probably fine since there are plenty of wild rabbits and the only thing dead were my flowers.She ran away and said she wasn't talking to me and stormed into our room and I started going off and said it was unfair to treat me like this because if she just trained her fucking animal NONE of this would've happened.My mom said she isn't picking a side but she still refuses to talk to me and its fucking dumb.So AITA?",

	"body" : "I (26F) have been dating my boyfriend Mike (25M) (obviously fake name) for about a year and a half. We are in a very serious and committed relationship, so serious that we are talking marriage and kids and we are currently looking to move in together. I was never one to date or go out with men in general so needless to say Mike is the first guy I’ve felt so serious about to introduce him to my family.Now, my cousin (31M) and his soon to be wife (34F) are getting married later this year, my cousin invited me couple of weeks ago and I accepted even though I don’t like his fiancé that well but because he’s family and in my culture weddings are a big deal so I kind of didn’t have a choice. I, in my mind, was thinking that the invitation was for me AND for my boyfriend since the whole family have known about him for a while and they have met him on multiple occasions.Today, I decided to ask my cousin about the plans of the wedding day to be up to date with everything and mentioned my boyfriend, that’s when he told me that the invitation was for me and me only, that they decided to invite family and close friends only and that it’s too late now because they’ve already planned the exact amount of food with the caterer, I said that I assumed that the invitation was for the both of us and that it doesn’t make sense to invite me and not my partner, the wedding is in MONTHS and they could still arrange with the catering company for one more plate. He said that they already paid and it wasn’t possible to add more people, that’s when I told him that I will not be attending the wedding because in my opinion it’s insulting to not include my partner who has been sharing my life for over a year.He didn’t reply but I received a call from my other cousin telling I’m TA for THREATENING to not come to the wedding, I told her I didn’t threaten not to come I am genuinely not coming, she said it’s ridiculous to expect my boyfriend to be invited and that I should just suck it up and be there for my family.So reddit, AITA for refusing to go to the wedding because my boyfriend is not invited or should I just stfu and go alone ?PS: I have to mention that my parents and siblings live in a totally different country, so I am living alone here that’s why, for me, it’s important to have my boyfriend with me during these occasions since I can’t have any other close member of my family, he kind of became my only close family here.EDIT: there seems to be some confusions so I will try to answer some questions and add some clarifications here.- Other family members and friends got the same invitation as me with the same wording and had their partners invited, not only married or engaged couples, just couples in general so before even talking with my cousin in the first place I already knew other couples are invited and going as couples, hence my reaction of finding it insulting that specifically my boyfriend was not included.- Some people seem to think that I threw a tantrum and made this about me, which I totally didn't. I do understand that I was wrong for assuming my boyfriend was invited and should've asked when I first got the invitation just to make sure. But I didn't in any way or form threw a tantrum, I politely asked if it was still possible to arrange with the caterer and when he said no I simply said that I will not be able to make it without my boyfriend. The other cousin who called me TA is the sister of the groom and I calmly explained to her that I just find it insulting that other couples are invited as couples but I was invited alone even though my cousin knows my boyfriend and that I would just rather skip the wedding.- Some people are saying that my relationship isn't \"serious\" enough for him to get an invitation and that we aren't even living together. I did mention that we were \"talking\" about moving in together, maybe I should've been more precise and added that we are actively looking for a new appartement and by the time the wedding comes we would be, very likely, already living together. My cousin does know all of this since he's the one who helped to find and move in my current appartement and he knows that I will be moving out in a few weeks/months to live with my boyfriend.- I did mention that I disliked the bride and some of you think it may be why they didn't extend my invitation. Not that it's important to mention this, but the reason why I dislike her is that I, on multiple occasions, have seen her being very mean to my cousin's 5 year old kid (from a previous union), she gives me mean stepmom vibes which is the reason why I dislike her in the first place. But that is my personal opinion, I have never discussed this with my cousin or anyone else in the family so this has nothing to do with the whole argument, I just mentioned that I dislike her to explain that I wasn't so excited about going to the wedding in the first place but I had do.- Many people seem to not get my point here, I do agree that I should've never expected my boyfriend to be invited, he is not officially a member of the family yet and I shouldn't have assumed that just because they know him he should get invited, I also shouldn't have asked if they could still arrange with the caterer to include my boyfriend, it's their wedding and they decide to invite who they want and it's not my place to ask from them to include someone just because of me, that was a mistake on my end. But that was not my original question here, I asked if I was TA for declining the invitation and not if I was TA for expecting my boyfriend to be invited.",

However, it was pretty apparent that I would be unable to buy a home in the city without the support of my parents. Well, I approached them and the answer was “no”. This was slightly upsetting as my parents are wealthy and could afford it, but I'm in the same situation as most other people — who cares, move on.I continued working in the city and they eventually offered to help me purchase a home. When I took them up on their offer they surprisingly said “no” again and told me that I should move to a region that I could afford. A little upsetting and confusing but fair enough.Needless to say, after a few years I moved to another part of the country that I could afford on my own. Very far from my friends and family — but economical.This is where things go awry. While I moved to one of the least expensive parts of the country, my sibling moved to an expensive city to start pursuing their career. My sibling had difficulty finding a property to rent, so my parents bought a property valued at roughly a million dollars and gifted it to my sibling to live in.I understand that no one is entitled to anything. I did however find this very upsetting. Far more upsetting than the “no” I heard before because it felt like my sibling was getting extremely preferential treatment.It was not until my parents bought my sibling a home that they offered to help me purchase a home. Here’s where I’m wondering if I am the asshole. I told them I moved across the country to a place I could afford independently because they made it very clear they would not assist me financially and I don’t need their help buying a home. Instead I would like money to put away into long-term investments as a retirement fund. I was also hoping to do this with their assistance as they are very financially savvy. It’s also worth noting that the home they are offering to buy me is something I can buy myself and maybe 20%-30% of what my sibling's home is worth. Lastly, I’m not particularly certain I will continue living in this area which is another reason why buying a home does not make sense.They have said “no” to the idea of investing money and are calling me entitled because I got upset when they informed me of their decision. I’m really confused here. The definition of entitled is when someone feels they are owed something, and I do indeed feel as if I am owed something. I would never have felt this way if my parents didn't buy my sibling a home. However, at this moment I’m really upset with them and feel they are picking favorites. AITA?",

For those who don't know, a rose toy is a sex toy that is commonly mentioned as a meme on TikTok and similar platforms. However, as someone who is into sex toys, I find it to be a very good product. It can be ordered cheaply from various websites, which is what I did. So, thinking that since we're all ladies here, I decided to gift rose toys to all four of my sisters and my mom. I also got them clothes and other items. When they opened the gifts I gave them, everything seemed fine until my youngest sister opened the rose toy and was like, \"umm...\" I said, \"Yeah, I got you guys rose toys.\" My mom and older sisters were like, \"What is that?\" with smiles on their faces, and I told them it's a sex toy. All of their smiles disappeared, and my mom said, \"A sex toy?\" I responded, \"Yes,\" and she asked, \"Why would you buy me a sex toy?\" I was shocked because I had found dildos and vibrators in her nightstand and closet before, so I wondered why she was acting surprised and acting like it was something new.

I told her, \"Listen, it's not a big deal, and you don't have to accept it.\" Then she said, \"Did you really think that it's okay to give your family and your younger sister, who is only 19, a gift like that?\" I responded, \"She's an adult, Mom.\" My sisters remained silent, and after I said that, things got quiet, and the rest of Christmas was spent with my mom obviously upset, and nobody accepted their rose toy. Which is fine, but my mom told me the day after, \"Don't expect an invite next Christmas.\" Really? I told her she needs to lighten up because she's a grown woman. There was no response. Am I the asshole for giving my family rose toys? This happened three days ago, and I'm curious about what I did wrong.",

Ex lives with his gf (31F).During dad’s time, he had GFs brother staying with him (older 20s M). That person has an ability to work remotely with a company issued laptop. My son states he was in the living room “in chill mode” and accidentally knocked over that computer resulting in minor damages. I asked where the owner of that computer was at the time, he says, “doing crafts with the girls in another room” (ex’s GF and my daughter). Ex, GF and GFs brother all admonish my kid for damaging the computer and ex tells him he has to pay $50 in damages (an amount he admits later he made up).I messaged ex (we are not cordial at all) and ask what happened bc my son is worried how he’s going to earn the $50. I told him I think the adult should be held responsible for putting away their things. I don’t feel like the kid should be punished for being a kid in their own home. Granted, I do strongly believe that unless my son picked it up and threw it on the floor intentionally it isn’t his fault for breaking it. Ex disagreed and said he is teaching his son “accountability”. At this point, I again restated the adult should have known to put away his belongings and I sent my ex $50 to cover the damage (at that point I hadn’t known it was a made up amount). In my defense of my son I said they were making my son out to be the scapegoat in the situation and I felt the adults were bullying him. I never questioned my son breaking the item, but I pointed out repeatedly that if the adult in the situation had put away their “toys” none of this would’ve happened. Ex disagreed and my son was confronted about the situation as soon as he returned to his dad’s house.AITA here?EDIT: I didn’t realize the word “toy” would bother so many. I did not call it a toy in exchanges with my ex. I called it a toy here bc when I talked to my kids about responsibilities, I told them it was their responsibility to put their toys away. I understand laptops are not toys. Please also understand that the damage was so minor there were not ACTUAL damages for repair.",

This really scared James and for weeks he would go wake up my brother in the middle of the night crying because he was scared the hat man was coming for him.Fast forward a bit. I was over at my brothers house for Christmas break and recently I’ve been getting these meme videos on my instagram of fake gnome sightings. They’re literally just stupid videos of a kid playing and then a poorly edited “gnome” will run past in the background. I find them pretty funny so I decided to mess with James a bit because I know how gullible he is. I sat next to him on the couch and I showed him one of these videos. First video he didn’t seem scared, he just looked at me and asked if it was real and I told him yes. We sat there for probably another 10 minutes watching these videos on this instagram account. By the end he started to look a bit scared but I really didn’t think anything of it. I left the day after Christmas and I jokingly told James to watch out for the gnomes.A few days ago I got a text from my brother Mike asking me if I showed James gnome sighting videos. I said yes and asked why. Apparently James has been really freaked out the past 2 weeks. He will not go in my brothers backyard to play because apparently that’s where a lot of gnomes are seen. I told Mike that was ridiculous and it was clearly a joke. He also told me James told his friends he believes these videos are real and now he’s being bullied by his friends. Mike said that I know how gullible James is and I should  have known better.James is too old to be believing in stuff like this and I told my brother this. My brother hasn’t spoken to me in a few days now and I’m not really sure what to do.

After all of our close friends started getting married, he finally decided that it was our turn too (that sentence alone makes me angry/upset and could be a whole other post in here).In September 2023 we decided to plan and book a destination wedding for December 2024. We were all for it until the first week of January when we started getting phone calls and texts from our family and friends saying they couldn't make it because of cost, how close it was to Christmas or because they couldn't take a week of from work. Mind you, people like his grandmother and my grandfather wouldn't have been able to go because of health reasons. We talked it over and decided to cancel it.Over the past 2 weeks, I have spent all of my free time informing our friends and families, looking for new venues, canceling our resort and travel agent, getting refunds and trying to plan a whole new wedding while he's been playing video games (side note, idc what he does with his spare time, this is just to set up my anger for later on).I found a beautiful venue, made an appointment to go see it this weekend and it's going to be financially better for us in the long run. He was super on board, looked at their website and was pleased. Today, he got an email from a realtor about some land that's available to purchase in an area we both agreed long ago we would want to build our forever home in. While I'm at work, he decides to spam text me saying he doesn't want to have the wedding anymore in case we buy this land, doesn't tell me anything about the land and doesn't answer his phone when I try and call to see what's going on.After he calms down and shows me the land, I agree that's its beautiful and it would be amazing to build our dream home 10 years ahead of schedule, but that I've been looking forward to a wedding, not only the 14 years we've been together but since I was little. I told him if I had to work overtime, door dash or do whatever to make some extra money until August (which was going to be our new wedding month) then I would and I was willing to give up my spare time for it.I thought after this, he would think about how I'm taking the initiative to get what I want and to work even harder for it and be proud or happy but instead he told me no, I wasn't allowed to do that. Me working more would mean he would have to deal with me being grumpy all the time and he didn't want to go through that for 7 months (I'm a cheerful person normally so I'm not sure where his thought was going while he said that). Apparently, I'm being unrealistic and unreasonable. Should I put the down payment on the venue and say fuck him?TL;DR Fiancée and I change wedding plans and while I'm spending my spare time to plan a new one, he throws it out the window for a piece of land for our dream home and says I'm unrealistic for wanting to work overtime for my wedding.",

	"body" : "My gf Lisa (27F) and I (28M) have been dating for two years and discussing about moving in soon. The main disagreement we have is about her dog, Coco.Lisa has had Coco for six years before we met her, so needless to say they are very attached to each other. I’ve never been a pet person, I’ve just never had one growing up and I also migrated from a country where there are a lot of stray dogs that just coexist with us, they’re not as adored or treated as part of the family as much as the Americans do. However, Coco is a small dog and Lisa loves her, so I’ve also taken on a caretaker role with Coco, such as buying her food & treats, cleaning up after her, walking her, etc.The main problem I have with Coco is having her on the bed every night when I sleep over at Lisa’s house. Every single night she will snuggle her way into sleeping in the middle, and usually kick me off the bed by slowly edging me out, getting aggressive when I try to move her. Every single time she hears a small noise in the house she will jump off the bed using my chest as a launch pad (a few times every night) which will wake me up. Half the time I’ve slept over at Lisa’s, I always end up sleeping on the couch. Having sexy time with Lisa is always an issue for us because Coco will jump on the bed every chance she gets, and when we ask her to step down she just stands there and stares, which is kinda weirds me out. When we put her outside the bedroom, she will bark/wail all night until we let her back in. Imagine trying to do it with a small dog running around on the bed every few minutes and hearing her wail loudly outside the door when we kick her out, it usually kills the mood fast. Coco also tends to get very aggressive at random times when I get physically close to Lisa, so I usually have to be very careful not to make sudden movements around Coco (one time she bit me when Lisa was tickling me so I bear hugged her and tackled her to the sofa jokingly. Another time she bit me again when Lisa dropped a large box in the kitchen and I ran in from the other room to see if she was ok) Lisa is used to everything since she’s had Coco for a long time.I am completely okay with not moving in together mainly because of Coco and I like having a place to myself where I can sleep peacefully all night, but my lady is basically getting mad I don’t want to move in and insists on us getting a place together. I told her that she either let Coco live at her mother's (5 mins walk away from where our new house will be) or I wont move in with her. I genuinely can’t imagine having to sleep on the couch every night in my own house or having to watch my back every time I want to hug my girlfriend if we were to move in. Lisa thinks I’m being the biggest douche for saying I won’t move in with Coco, but I’m just mostly concerned about my sleep and since Lisa is always against disciplining Coco, so I don’t think it’s that absurd for me to not want to move in unless my condition is met.",

I understand where she’s coming from and have a soft spot for that detail. The only problem is that her friend’s husband is, first of all, a horrible person. He kicked my girlfriend’s friend out of his house a week after she gave birth to his child (they are an overall toxic couple) and proceeded to message my girlfriend on Instagram. He was trying to flirt with her and basically hitting on her. My girlfriend brought this up to me, so this isn’t a trust problem, I trust her. He’s someone she has known through mutual friends so he’s no stranger either. Her friend and her husband eventually reconciled and she moved back with him (to no surprise). Today my girlfriend told me she planned on going to her friend’s house to get her hair done, and I told her I don’t think she should do that; that I was uncomfortable with it.

	"body" : "At the start of any friendship, I make it known that I do not like dogs. There is a lot of backstory to it that doesn't matter too much, but the main reason is that barking causes me severe distress as I have very bad sensory issues.When I met \"Amy\" two years ago, one of the first things she brought up was having two dogs that she loved. I immediately told her that was cool, however, I don't like dogs and we should probably just hang out outside and I wouldn't come over to hers. Then one day when we meet up (she takes the bus to meet me), she brings one of her dogs. It's a small dog she can fit in her backpack and it never stops barking. I politely tell her that I cannot handle the sound of barking as it literally makes my head pound and she does what all dog moms do.\"He's just a baby.\" \"He's literally fine don't worry about it.\" \"There's nothing wrong with him barking you'll get over it.\" \"It's so cute how he's barking at the other dogs, he's talking to them!\"When she also knows that I have severe sensory issues (another one is that I cannot be touched and that one can be respected just fine.)Anyway, this has happened multiple times over the last two years and I've just dealt with it as I love Amy as a friend. I usually just bring earbuds or make sure the dog stays away from me at all times. Except now she keeps talking about moving in together once our leases are up this year and I was into it at first until I remembered she has dogs (object permanence).I guess I'm asking for help. How would I even go about reminding her of this? I feel like a b*tch.WIBTA if I told her no, I don't want to move in because of your dogs?",

I’m the only one in my family that goes to this school currently as all of my older siblings and cousins either go to different schools or have dropped out completely. A long time ago, my cousin (15 f) gave me a bunch of her clothes to sort through and decide if I wanted any of it, and I didn’t. A lot of the clothes I was given were old school uniforms that were only out of date for a few years. Recently, my school switched from an ugly white shirt that didn’t stay white for long, to the sports shirts that were more popular either. There were also navy blue shirts in the same fabric as the white ones but only a few people actually wear them.These clothes that my cousin gave to me literally just sat in my room either on my floor or on my desk for a solid 6 or 7 months. I didn’t want them and neither did anyone else but whenever I brought up what we should do with them to my mum she would just disregard and said to just keep them in my room. I had no space for them in my room so I just shoved them into a box and they sat there for another month before one day I got angry at everything and threw them out since the last time I asked her she told me if I didn’t want them to just throw them out so that’s what I did.Today I felt guilty about it though. It’s been a few weeks since my hissy fit, (it wasn’t about the clothes they were just collateral damage) and my mum came knocked on my door like she always does, I told her she couldn’t come in since I was getting dressed and she asked me about the old school clothes and I informed her that I had thrown them out with all of my cousins other old clothes and she responded with “of course you did”. That wasn’t exactly something that was out of the ordinary since that’s how my mum often responds to things like that. After a few moments of silence she asked me why I would throw them out and tells me about this Facebook group she’s in that was looking for hand me down clothes to people that need them and wanted to donate. I responded with “they had just been sitting on my floor and in that box for months, we weren’t doing anything with them then.” She didn’t say anything and just walked away. I could tell she was disappointed in me.I do feel bad for those kids that aren’t going to be able to get school uniforms because I threw out clothes they could have used but I also feel like my mum could have taken care of the clothes since her room is bigger and more spacious instead of making me keep them all that time and doing nothing with them.

Once I got home, I waited 3 hours for my roommate to wake up and drive her to work like always. After getting home and struggling to sleep, I slept for 4 hours by the time I had to wake up and get my roommate from work.Once we got home I had time for a 3-hour nap before my next shift and I desperately needed to sleep some more or else it was going to be hell.Our living room is my personal space when I sleep (we live in a small one bedroom apartment not much bigger than a studio.) I laid on the couch and spent 45 minutes trying to doze off. I slept for 30 minutes before my roommate woke me up telling me to move my nap to the bedroom because she had 2 friends coming over to drink. By this time it was almost 9 and I would be waking up at 10 to start getting ready for my shift.I immediately felt enraged that she thought it’s okay to wake me up and invite people over knowing I was sleeping an hour before I usually wake up. She knows I have awful insomnia and need total quiet, I can’t sleep if people are socializing in our small apartment.I was now wide awake from how annoyed I felt that I completely blew up on her. I started shouting about how it’s complete bullshit that I do all these chores and favors for her and our apartment, sacrificing my sleep schedule, but when I desperately need to nap, she invites people over while I’m asleep instead of waiting for me to wake up and go to work.I yelled that she is being extremely inconsiderate to me, especially since I help her out so much when it comes to her sleep schedule. Without me, she’d get less than a full night’s rest because she’d be waking up early to take the bus. I completely dominated the fight. I must have yelled around the house for 15 minutes.I feel horrible for my behavior. It was a mixture of being cranky and feeling disrespected. I can’t stop thinking about how loud and upset I sounded over a nap. But I hate when I go the extra mile for people and they can’t even do the bare minimum for me. It’s one of the few things that can send me into a rage because people always take advantage of my good heart.Should I feel sorry that I let my emotions get the best of me?

	"body" : "[Reposted because the last post was deleted] I'm about to turn 16 and have been looking forward to celebrating this milestone birthday in a grand way with my closest friends and family. However, I recently ran into a frustrating situation. A friend of mine, who actually has her birthday two months before mine, has planned her birthday party on the exact same day as mine. This wouldn’t have been an issue, but since we are part of the same friend group, most of the people she's invited are also the ones I intended to invite to my party.Understanding the significance of my 16th birthday, I decided to address this overlap directly with her. I called her, hoping we could find a compromise, like shifting her party by a day or two, and give her a gift of her choice (along with her birthday gift, as I was really desperate to have my birthday on that very day). Her party is delayed anyway, so I thought this wouldn’t be a big ask. But to my dismay, she refused to change her plans, stating that her grandparents would be visiting and it’s the only time they could celebrate. She suggested that I should be the one to reschedule.For context, I also could not keep my party on another day due to personal issues, I did try telling her this.I explained my discomfort with the idea of having two parties on the same day. Her party is scheduled for about five hours, and I wanted mine to last for three and a half hours, including a movie and some fun activities. I was concerned that our friends wouldn't be able to attend both, especially considering their parents might not allow it.I normally try to be understanding in situations like this, but I couldn’t help feeling upset that she didn’t seem to consider my position. I wanted to have a day to myself, on my actual birthday, which comes once a year. So, in my frustration, I lashed out a bit. I told her that I wanted the attention on my birthday and that it shouldn't be too hard for her to find another date for her party, given the two-month gap between our actual birthdays.She ended the call abruptly and didn't respond to my texts until much later, only to say she couldn't change the date and if I couldn't attend, it was my loss. Meanwhile, she started planning her party in our group chat, and everyone else confirmed they would attend.AITA for feeling upset and wondering if I was wrong for wanting my birthday to be about me and for asking her to accommodate?Edit: I have decided to talk it out with her again, and without making any rash decisions in anger. I shall update accordingly.Edit 2: I may have written this wrong, but she did NOT want her grandparents, nor her parents at her party. She wanted the house to herself, so that she could call us over.Edit 3: She and I have very different tastes, ideas and plans for our party. We both do agree on one decision, not to have a joint party.Update: We have sorted it out. I am very thankful to all the comments, I know my mistake, and I have taken the suggestions and advice into account. She has managed to convince her parents to change the date, as it turns out she had gotten the dates mixed up. I have expressed my sincere gratitude to her as well.",

She's made blankets and hats and cardigans and bags. She absolutely LOVES crocheting.But for the past 1 ½ years, for Christmas and my birthday I've only ever been given her crocheted stuff. Don't get me wrong: I appreciate the time and effort she's put into those gifts and they're really good.BUT: Our birthdays are really close (we're born thirteen days apart, my birthday's first), and she's always hyping up my presents and how much I'm going to LOVE my present, and I've become really stressed about what to give her in return (the same applies to Christmas).I've tried really hard to find something amazing for her as well - so far I've talked to her favourite artist and asked for her permission to buy one of her pictures (my besties favourite art) digitally so I can print it on a sweatshirt. Then for her birthday I got her a ticket to her favourite musical, and bought myself one as well (even though I genuinely don't like it) so we can have a cool day out together. And for this Christmas I got her something to help with crocheting (a ring called CrochetPal), a book about new crocheting patterns, and a book from her book list that she hasn't read yet.In return, for my birthday I got a self-made handbag (I only ever use backpacks or fanny bags, and she KNOWS that), and this Christmas I got three pairs of crocheted earrings. I like wearing ridiculous earrings like little water bottles or whiskey bottles, or -my favourite- a serving of currywurst with chips, but unfortunately the crocheted pairs and not really my style as they're pretty, but not funny.I'm usually very vocal about the things I like, and I feel like she could easily get me anything in relation to the things I won't shut up about.I'm increasingly getting frustrated with the presents because while they're good presents, they just don't actually seem like they fit me.

I asked them why didn’t they call me so I could come and help and they replied: “I’m not supposed to remember you schedule, you should’ve called us to ask if we were still there, we made sacrifices by cancelling our extracurriculars today and so should’ve you but you didn’t.”. I was shocked and confused and I started to get angry and asked them: “how was I supposed to know you were still there if you told me you were going to be gone by 4PM?!” They answered by saying they had a change of plans and I was done. I was really upset, i was crying and even though it seems like a stupid reason to cry, they were leaving me out the past months and, idk, I was feeling really lonely.

To be honest, she's kind of bad at her job, she's really clumsy, forgets where she puts things and sometimes leaves things dirty or messy, she does stuff like that. It's not a big deal because the other housekeepers and us generally pick up the slack of her shortcomings. She's a very sweet person and I don't think she does this on purpose.Mary also has a habit of throwing out what she feels like is ugly/worn out without asking us first. I'm sure she means well but it's by far her most annoying trait. It has happened so many times now that we have learned to keep most of the things that we absolutely don't want thrown out in boxes/drawers locked, or in rooms where she doesn't go.My cousin has come to live with us because our city has more opportunities than the place where she's from. She has been here for three months now. Mary has December off, but yesterday was her first day off as she works all January.My cousin was looking through her stuff and couldn't find a particular hoodie she had brought. She looked all over and was pretty frantic because it was a hoodie that her mom had bought her like five years ago and was pretty special for her. She asked Mary and Mary said it was practically a piece of rag and that she had thrown it out. Cousin got extremely upset and started yelling at Mary, saying she was a pathetic worker and that she couldn't even do her job well and bla bla bla. I told cousin to shut up and that she couldn't talk to Mary like that, and then we started fighting with each other.We only stopped because mom intervened, she apologized to Mary and sent her home, then she told cousin that she would do what she can to replace the hoodie and then sent her to her room, and then I got a huge scolding for fighting with my cousin. I'm still grumpy because I was scolded but I'll probably get over it.I understand that cousin was mad about her hoodie, but I don't think there's a reasonable excuse for yelling at a worker.

No drinking and smoking around him he has to get a full time job and provide he’s not a teen anymore this is real life etc. for 9 months he swore up and down he would make all this happen and he was going to work full time and he would quit smoking.

He recently has increased his involvement to loading the dishwasher and laundry about once a week, folding his clean clothes, playing/tv with the kids for an hourish about 3/wk and taking the kids to bed after bath routine 4/wk. Plus pressing repairs to car/home. He has been pursuing a veterinary career and finished his DVM 5 months ago. He retook the NAVLE last month so he can't get a vet job yet. He has never had a full-time job due to school demands, but began working a flexible schedule for his dad in construction at $20/hr that is equivalent to about 3/4 time. He takes 1/2 days every Friday to work 2 hours in the local vet clinic as a \"shadow\" for free to stay in practice while he waits for licensure. He will also go hunting 1-2 times during the week in addition to using 8-14 hours on Saturdays to do ranching or hunting. I work part-time for $18/hr and also have gone back to online school to get my bachelor's (full time course load). I work M-Th 8a-1p and do school 2-4p. Friday and Saturday are for home/family catch up with appointments, cleaning, groceries, etc. Sunday is church and extended family obligations since both our families live in our county. I'm exhausted. I've done my best to be extremely supportive. He has never had to carry the mental load of anything outside school, part-time work, and occasional repairs. He knows I will always make up the difference for everything else. Sundays are especially hard because I hit burnout and he's cranky because he hates being stuck in the house. I just want to recover. Mornings are always contentious because I try to sleep in and make myself up for church, but that makes for a scrunch to get the girls ready because he just watches TV/phone and then takes 5 minutes to get dressed and comb his hair. He hates not being at least 10 minutes early so he gets to yelling at the kids and making snide remarks. I do 40 min choir after church and try to get about an hour of rest in before more housework and then family dinners. I'm extra raw because he took off without even asking on Christmas morning for 3 hours to try out the new shotgun despite my spending the last 2 months stressing how important the family day was to me. This after spending 2 days on his family's ranch-helping take care of my SIL's 3 sick kids (she was working and I didn't know they'd be at in-laws house) on top of mine and being sick . I snapped and was in a deep depressive episode for about 6 hours where I just kept crying.

Today he was given a new treat, a bone-shaped biscuit that appears to be coated in frosting, and his reaction to it has me, my dad, and my uncle a little baffled. Normally he'll chew it, throw it on the floor and roll on it, but for this new treat, he just...holds it in his mouth.

I don't know if the treat is too big or too tough for him to chew on, or if he's just confused by the taste or texture of it, or if he maybe just wants to savor it, but I don't want to just let him be if his reaction to the treat is, in fact, a negative one.I'm no expert in dogs or their body language, but it just feels like I'm more concerned than my uncle, his owner, is.

He's always had a pretty controlling mother who was never very comfortable with trans people, and would constantly get angry at my friend for small things. His parents were separated so she would constantly keep him from his dad's house if she was mad at him. She started to get more and more controlling(getting mad at smaller things ,never letting him see any of his friends outside of school ever, checking his phone constantly etc)  causing him to get a whole secret tablet to text me and his other friends so his mom couldn't see that he was venting to me about her and about how she doesn't listen to him.Her controlling got to the point that my friend would text me nearly daily about panic attacks he was having at what would happen if his mom found out about him being trans or his vents.he would shake a lot and text me when he started to spiral. At some point he even had to go to a school counselor it was getting so bad and he had me come with him.  Well, eventually my friend had an edible at a sleepover (normal teenager behavior) we talked about it over text and then in June I get an email from my friends school account stating that his mom found his tablet and searched through all of his things and that because he was \"talking shit\" about his mom in a private conversation, I was shoving bad behavior on him and I was a bad influence. Ever since then it's been pure silence from him.I reached out to his sister for a short period who told me about how he had everything taken and was being forced to go to online school instead of public school with the rest of his friends before she ghosted me. No one else has heard from him in 7 months. I reached out to his father only to get a dry response and then more silence. The most contact I've attempted is trying to leave a birthday present on his doorstep in August only for his mother to come outside and scream \"NO NO\" at me over and over as I drove away. I've driven past his house a couple of times since June and haven't even caught a glimpse of him. His family's obvious ghosting of me and the rest of his friends makes me feel very weird about continuing to try and reach out but completely cutting him off from all of his friends and putting him on online school because he was venting to his friends about his mother seems extremely dramatic.

For his gifts I got him a nice keyboard for his computer stuff (30$) and the Daily Bugle Lego set (370$) that he had his heart set on. Maybe a week or two before Christmas he told me one of my gifts wasn’t coming until Valentine’s Day (they were Ugg’s I really wanted that he said he would get for my birthday but didn’t). I let it go, thinking maybe he’ll get me something else in place of the Uggs since they were coming so late. He told me my other gift was a stuffed animal (40$). Again, I let it go. Closer to Christmas my parents and almost everyone around me was upset since I spent about 400$ on him and he spent maybe 140$ and one of the gifts I wouldn’t even get on time. The more I heard it from everyone, the more upset I got. He came to my house Christmas Day and gave me my gift. It was a pound puppy, an old 80s stuffed dog. I was not happy. I thanked him and told him I liked it but I was honestly really upset and disappointed. When we went to his house later, his parents ended up getting more for me than him. I tried not to let it get to me, thinking I’m being unappreciative and maybe he just couldn’t afford anything else but my mom put it into perspective for me. My mom bought the Christmas presents by herself this year for 5 kids (including me) and paid bills with the same hourly pay as my bf. And let me assure you these gifts were not stuffed animals. I confronted this to him saying that it really hurt that he didn’t put any effort into his gift. He says he liked the gift he got me and thought I would like it too. We aren’t really talking right now, just 1 word replies here and there, but it makes me feel like maybe I should just appreciate that I got something at all. Aita?Edit: let me just clarify: no, no money boundaries were set and he did admit that he could afford something better. No, I do not care about monetary value, it’s just for reference.

It was a long process un-learning everything and finally being comfortable in my own skin which took me till I was about 19 to feel comfortable. My family is VERY religious and considers homosexuality to be a “sin” being why I’ve never told them that I was gay. Well Jake and I have been together for 6 months now and are planning on renting a small apartment together In February. the thing is Jake feels like he’s being kept a secret which he doesn’t like, which I completely understand, but I just knew that my family wouldn’t be accepting and would kick me out/disown me. But now that I’m planning on moving out being able to support myself I decided to come out. Well at Christmas this year hosted at my aunts house I decided to bring Jake along with me as he isn’t too close with his family, and everyone was asking me questions, such as asking me who he is and how long we’ve been friends for, I politely asked for my family to stop with the questions but they just kept asking. I eventually became overwhelmed and stressed and it just came out of me in the middle of Christmas dinner, I told them that Jake was actually my boyfriend and that we’ve been together for 6 months now. The table went SILENT, you could hear a pin drop in that room, my mother left the table crying and grabbed a photo of Jesus and started yelling at me claiming I was going to “burn in hell” the rest of my family (except for a couple of my cousins) were on her side, and all of a sudden I had almost my whole family yelling at me, crying, and telling me to burn in hell and that I’m not welcome in their lives anymore. I ended up excusing myself and went home to Jake’s house, I had a couple of my cousins reach out asking me if I was okay, but the rest of my family were harassing me telling me I’m a waste of a life and ruined Christmas, Aita?I forgot to add in that this was my grandmas last Christmas (she’s terminal) but I honestly didn’t mean to come out of Christmas, when I say that I was gonna tell them I was planning on a later date, some time in January before I move out",

	"body" : "ATIA? I am expecting my first child in June. When I shared this exciting news with two of my best girl friends when I first got pregnant, they excitedly talked about planning something fun like a baby shower or a weekend away. Obviously, I assumed that the two of them, being the amazing friends they are, would take the initiative a few months later to make that happen, especially now that I am in my second trimester. Thinking they were on top of it, I casually mentioned my expectation for a baby shower to another friend. This person, who lives in another state, kindly offered to help plan and reached out to the other two friends. This triggered the 2 friends to realize they were unexpectedly in charge. They reached out to me asking what I was expecting, and without batting an eyelash, I excitedly told them I wanted a co-ed baby shower, swiftly secured a date, and even sent them a guest list, which includes around 40+ people. Did I mention this is my first child, and I explicitly asked them to take charge because I've got a lot on my plate? I'm going on a baby-moon with my husband soon, and most of my free time is dedicated to researching everything for this new chapter of motherhood.I should note that my family and coworkers are also throwing me two separate showers, but my friends are not invited to either of those. Besides deserving a shower, I'm frankly a bit perturbed that my best friends are not more excited about this. They should WANT to throw my husband and I a shower to celebrate our next chapter, right?Edit: I did not mean to sound like I was expecting anything. I am merely trying to express that I would hope that my good friends would be more excited and organized, which they clearly are not.  I would be more than happy to throw myself a party but I simply do not have the time to do so.  I should also clarify that three showers is really a division between three separate groups of people in my life: The desire to have a separate friends and family shower is because my family shower is women only and very traditional.  While my friends are not invited to the shower my family is hosting, my family is not invited to my friend's one either.   The one that I am getting through work is very rudimentary and everyone at my work who is having a baby gets the same sort of thing, and none of my colleagues are on my \"friends\" guest list either.",

My sister says I'm an asshole because my niece should be my encouragement for giving up smoking altogether. I get everyone has different views around smoking but personally smoking is something I'm going to do.AITA for not giving up smoking because of my niece?",

	"body" : "I (22F) have a younger sister named Mabel (20F). Growing up, Mabel was always very academically inclined. However, she was also always shy. She got bullied a lot in grade school for reasons such as being \"too fat\" \"too weird\" \"too crazy\" \"a crybaby\" \"too ugly\". Mabel just wanted to show up and get her responsibilities done to the best of her abilities. She had some friends but has since lost contact since leaving grade school for high school (she had no phone at the time).When she was in 4th grade, a few boybands came onto the scene. That was one of the more difficult years as that was one of the peaks of bullying she endured, plus our parents were getting divorced and her teacher at the time favoured the boys who bullied her. She did admit to trying to fit in during this period. She started listening to them and they seemed to help her get through these hard times. Once finished all schoolwork, she would listen to their music and read as much as she could about them to learn as much as she could about them. She is still a walking encyclopedia about these bands to this day, and since then LOTS more information about the individuals in the bands and stuff has been coming out. She sometimes tends to harp on things for too long or monologue about them, and this was no exception. When asked to talk about something else, she would go quiet, though she says its hard for her brain to think about other things outside of school sometimes because she really loves the bands.There was also an incident in high school where two girls were gossiping about her in front of our mom at the grocery store, calling her \"weird\". There's one who I suspect envies Mabel because Mabel had better grades than she did, especially in English. Also, a guy that she liked was staring at Mabel's butt and not her and that made her upset.Mabel is now in a prestigious university and doesn't see any of them. I noticed that others were nice in high school, though it didn't seem like Mabel tried to get close to any of them. I thought uni would be a good opportunity for her to learn social skills and branch out and make friends.Recently, she and I were on the train, as I work near her uni and was thus helping her find classes and stuff (also there have been crime incidents on public transport so I wanted to keep her safe). A uni classmate came up to her and said \"Hello\" and Mabel was sharing how her Christmas went. The classmate then proceeded to ask Mabel about band C, the least mainstream of the bands she liked. Mabel said she didn't have time to check as she had been busy. They then proceeded to talk about their classes and TikTok.I asked Mabel why she was talking about band C with classmates, as I told her she shouldn't because the topic is niche and I worry that her peers would find her weird for liking that band. I asked her who mentioned band C first, and she said she didn't remember. She also talked about them at our Halloween party. AITA?",

	"body" : "Throwaway account and all names are changed.Hi everyone.  I'm in a bit of a situation and was hoping for some advice.  I (30F) recently got married to my wonderful husband Larry (33M), and our wedding went perfectly except for one thing.  Larry has two older siblings: Candace (38F) and Orlando (40M), and he's very close to them.  He also has several cousins, most of whom he likes.  He has a cousin, Susan (38F), who's married to Gabriel (39M).  Larry thinks that Susan has undiagnosed autism due to her difficulties in social situations and inability to maintain eye contact.  Candace and Orlando agree with this assessment.  Apparently she was never diagnosed because her younger brother Brad, 35M, had high-maintenance ADHD that required a lot of their parents' attention when they were younger, so Susan didn't get as much attention.  I'd met Susan once at a large family function before our wedding and she was very nice, but I didn't get a chance to know her better because there were so many people.  Brad is super nice as well, and I've gotten to know him better because he and his wife live closer to us.  Brad also thinks that Susan might have autism.Anyway, when Larry and I were doing seat arrangements for our wedding, we ended up with several tables that only had two spots available, so we had to split up larger parties.  We put Brad and his wife at a table with other cousins their age, as Larry thought Brad would get along with everyone better.  We put Susan and Gabriel at a table with older relatives, as Larry thought Susan would be more comfortable there.Throughout the reception, Brad and his wife had a great time socializing, whereas Susan didn't.  Every time she'd try to go socialize with them, the other cousins would be polite but would talk around her about things that didn't include her, so she felt left out.  Susan and Gabriel eventually just left the reception halfway through the evening, but no one noticed her absence for several hours.  It wasn't until we were doing final photos at the end of the evening that someone thought to look for Susan, couldn't find her, and then texted her to ask her where she'd gone.  She simply said that she and Gabriel had left earlier. Everyone got upset that she didn't tell anyone she'd left, and Larry was mad that she ruined our final photos by disappearing.Here's where I might be TA: I texted Susan that it was no wonder everyone thought she had autism when she acted like this.  She responded by blocking everyone's phone numbers and has been off the grid since then.  Now Brad is saying that I'm TA for 'outing' our opinions of her when we could've just kept it quiet, but I was upset that Susan had caused such a fuss at my wedding.  AITA?",

Like most kids his age, he is still learning about emotions and how to express them, and, recently, was having a particularly difficult day.He was throwing tantrums left and right, and was visibly upset. Of course, I wanted to comfort him/help him understand his big feelings better. After yet another tantrum, I gently approached him and said, “Sweetie, it seems like you need a hug right now. Would you like one?”To my surprise, he immediately calmed down, and reached out for a hug. We embraced for a few moments, and he seemed to find comfort in my arms. It was a heartwarming moment for both of us, and I truly believed it was the right thing to do.However, when I shared this incident with my family, they were absolutely outraged. They accused me of taking away my toddler’s autonomy by telling him what he needed, and argued that I should have let him figure it out on his own without my intervention.My intention was never to control/manipulate my toddler’s emotions, but rather to offer him comfort when he seemed overwhelmed. I believe that at such a young age, he may not always have the vocabulary or understanding to express his needs clearly, and I saw the opportunity to help him in a gentle way.So, Reddit: I turn to you.AITA for telling my toddler that he needed a hug? Did I overstep my boundaries as a parent, or was I simply trying to provide comfort and support to my child in a challenging moment?TL;DR: After my toddler had a series of tantrums, I gently suggested he might need a hug, which calmed him down.

Liam is a recovering alcoholic, my apartment has been a sort of 'safe haven' for keeping him sober; he still lives with his mum, the estate where he lives is filled with lads around his age who do drink heavily, they all know my boyfriend and therefore they frequently invite him to go to pubs or to house parties with them, there's constant temptation there for him while in my apartment he is removed from that scene.This is for context, but my apartment is a rather large one in a high rise, practically in the middle of our town. I guess this can be alluring to some of Liam's mates and he invites them over frequently, I guess this time his friends had also invited their friends and so on, because Liam ended up throwing some sort of impromptu party whilst I was working. When I came home, the place was an absolute tip and I found Liam drunk as hell and injured from slamming his head on a wall apparently. I tried to get him to sober up and took care of his injuries (his nose ended up being broken).Later on in the day, the people who were passed out earlier on started leaving, and I was stuck comforting Liam as well as trying to make a start of cleaning the apartment. My ex, Justine (F30) called me to ask if I could take our son, Alex (M3), for the day (we have an informal custody agreement, with her taking care of the boy mostly). I told her that I couldn't see him that day - the apartment wasn't appropriate for him at the time, and Liam was a mess who also needed to be taken to a&e due to the state of his nose.

	"body" : "I (23F) have been in a great relationship with my boyfriend, Paul (23M), for around two years now. Recently, we attended the funeral service of one of his best friends since high school, and during the service, Paul kissed the coffin. Not many people seemed to notice, and I thought it was a nice gesture, but I was kinda weirded out. He approached me and looked at me, saying, “What’s that face about?” and I just whispered, “Oh nothing, I just think that was kinda awkward, unusual” Paul just gave me a smile and kept walking with teary eyes.I know funerals are highly emotional events so I didn’t mention anything else after that and I didn’t meant to directly judge his behaviour.The next day, during a casual conversation with a couple of our group friends, I mentioned to one particular friend that I thought Paul kissing the coffin was kinda weird but sweet in retrospective, not really thinking much about it, just as a recounting of the previous day. One of our mutual friends overheard us and said, “I don’t think that’s weird; it was our last time to say goodbye right?” and that she thought it was a touching moment. At that point, everyone joined the conversation, and one of the other friends was like, “Oh buddy!!!” and gave my boyfriend a big hug. I added, “Yeah, I said it was sweet but not something you see every day, isn't it?” and everyone got all quiet.My boyfriend seemed a little uncomfortable. He said, \"Please, let’s change the subject.\" we did but after that, he kinda zoned out and left earlier than we had planned for that day. This was almost two weeks ago, and we're still talking like usual, but I don’t want to keep bothering our friends over this, and I'd rather not bother Paul since he’s still grieving. My sister thinks I was wrong to express my thoughts at that moment and that kissing a closed casket or coffin is not really that unusual, and I should leave it alone.I know that writing a Reddit post is the opposite of leaving it alone, but some of our mutual friends told me I was being very obnoxious that day with Paul by bringing up the subject. So, I guess I need to know from more perspectives if I was indeed an a-hole for mentioning what I was thinking.Perhaps it's a cultural thing because I was raised in Germany, and he’s French, but I don’t believe I was rude for simply bringing it up! Maybe I lack funeral service etiquette?EDIT:  I knew his friend too, and he was a great guy and an amazing person all around. Just so you know I’m also grieving in a way",

He changed the topic and told the teacher that I had spread the screenshot of that convo which I shouldn't have done because it was embarrassing, and it should've been kept private. Although the teacher reprimanded him for talking about me behind my back, she scolded me too for sharing the screenshot. I said it was clearly justifiable and that others should know how bigoted he is. But she insisted that both of us were in the wrong and that each of us should apologise to each other.

Let's call her 'Jenny' for simplicity's same. We have been friends for 6 years.Jenny is very extroverted and likes.to be occupied every weekend. I'm more ambivalent, leaning towards introverted. I enjoy having more alone time or hanging out at friend's houses. We are both overweight, though her a bit less than me.Usually, we compromise and find something to do we both enjoy. I will attend events she throws for specific reasons (like birthdays) even if they aren't necessarily things that I enjoy or would do otherwise because she's my friend and I love her. We went on a road trip last year for her birthday and ended up going to a museum and escape room all in the same day.Recently, she has started a new job and is now working with my mom. They have gotten close and chat often.December and January have been incredibly busy months with things every single weekend. I have done something in each of them. I even went to Jenny's house one Friday after work to drink wine and eat cheese, even though I don't really drink wine.Jenny has been planning her birthday party for months. At first, she wanted to do a scooter trip for her birthday, similar to what we did last year. Since the timing didn't work out for other travels and things, we were going to do this scooter trip in April when there's a long weekend despite her birthday being in February. She has since decided to also do something on her actual birthday.She's planning to go go-karting, ice-skating, mini-golfing, and karaoking all on the same day in another city. However, I can't attend all of those events due to a foot injury I sustained a year ago. I informed her of this and while she was trying to convince me otherwise at first, it seemed like we reached a compromise that worked for both of us. I just wouldn't attend all of the events.Apparently, I was wrong. She ended up using her new relationship with my mom to complain about me not wanting to go out and do things. She is now incredibly concerned about my physical and mental health, because physically I'm incapable of doing certain activities. (I broke my foot a year ago from a work-related fall. My weight has nothing to do with it). She's apparently planning on book an appointment with a therapist for me and surprising me with it (she is paying). The catch is, she has NEVER once brought up any of these concerns with me. She's never communicated her alleged concern to me in the 6 years we've been friends.I'm hurt and upset and now do not want to attend her birthday festivities at all. I know being direct with her doesn't work. She makes up excuses, or tries to emotionally blackmail me. The most drama-free solution is to simply fake an illness.

Sunny was the sun we needed in our lives and we love him so much. I adopted him from a really bad owner so he fell in love with us too.About six months ago our mutual friend told us her brother and his wife are splitting up and giving away their two kittens. Their marriage was psychologically abusive for years now and they bought the kittens for a last resort before ending their marriage. Since they cannot take care of the kittens alone (because they also have two kids together) they decided to sell the kittens to someone. We were struggling financially so we could not buy the cats. But our friend loved the cats so much that she wanted the cats to go to a house she knows. She persuaded her brother, and since he could not sell them at that time, he agreed to give the cats to us.After that we had three cats to take care of and it put us in a binding spot financially. Since Thunder and Cloud (the kittens we adopted) were British shorthair, they were getting sick constantly. Especially Thunder, because he was a pure breed. I was afraid we were neglecting the kittens and begged him to give them away to someone. He finally agreed to give Cloud away to our other friend. But we were still fighting about the kittens and I was afraid something was gonna happen. There was also a possibility that he would go abroad to work and wanted to bring the cats with him. I told him that Thunder could not go abroad, because he could not withstand the drugs they give himon the plane and he is most definitely not bringing Sunny with him anywhere. Because Sunny and I went through so many hardships. We got into a fight again.Couple of weeks ago, Thunder started throwing up everywhere and he could not eat anything. My roommate told me he is gonna bring him to a vet. And I lashed out then and there again. I asked him, with what money are you gonna get him treated, and I told him his love for him is killing the kitten. Thunder seriously needs some surgeries that we cannot afford. I found a couple of good people who would adopt Thunder but he most definitely says that he cannot give him away. I suspect that he is loving this kitten so much because Thunder is an expensive cat and Sunny isn't. The thing is he is making me out to be a bad guy because I don't love Thunder and treating him bad. Me and my roommate don't spend that much time together at home (because of the work hours) so he doesn't see it when I'm playing with both of them. To him, I'm heartless and cruel to want to give Thunder away. So am I the asshole for telling my friend we should give away our cat?tldr; My roommate and I cannot afford two kittens and their vet expenses, so I think we should give one of them away.

January last year, Paul and his brother Peter got into a car accident that ended Peter’s life. Recently, Paul has been extremely passive aggressive towards me. Paul has always had trouble communicating and tended to lash out, typically we have been able to talk through it. Paul had started bringing up traits of mine in order to make me feel guilty about taking his kindness.I have developed ARFID (Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder) and have a hard time eating. Paul offered to buy my food knowing this and even when I protest he got me something. I believed it was just his pure kindness. One day, Paul and I were playing video games. I must have made a joke that upset Paul. I felt awful so I messaged him asking if I had said something wrong (it’s hard to tell). Paul became aggressive and started to tell me that I have been guilt tripping him.He blamed my eating disorder for guilting him into paying for my food and wasting his money and never giving back (he refused any of my offers to pay him back). I apologized profusely and told him how awful it was for him to insinuate that my eating disorder is a weapon for guilt tripping. We eventually figured it out and agreed to set up boundaries.On an important day I overslept and had a meltdown over it. Once my head cleared I realized that Paul and our friend, Emma (18 F), were driving in for second period (our term had switched). I begged to get picked up for second period, stressing that I needed to be there for class. They agreed.Second period starts at 9:48. They showed up at my house at 10:45. I had missed my group presentation, had missed messages from my group asking me where I was and all I could do was cry. I told Emma and Paul to go without me and stayed home to control my feelings. The next day I told them how it hurt me that they didn’t show up on time. Emma told me she hadn’t realized how important it was that I show up for that class. Behind me, Paul mumbled something. I turned and asked him what he had said.  Paul rolled his eyes and said “It’s not our fault you didn’t wake up on time.” I quickly grew upset, I never insinuated it was. I left as Paul refused to acknowledge I was still trying to talk to him.I told Emma how cruel Paul had been recently and how he weaponizes and singles me out every time I make a mistake despite how much I try to make up for it. She offered her support but said that I shouldn’t ignore Paul because the accident is why he’s acting out. I have been sympathetic but I’m done walking on eggshells waiting for him to blow up on me. I have been waiting for an apology since. If I mattered to him he should apologize and set things straight right? It has been 5 weeks and people say I overreacted. AITA?",

	"body" : "I attend a school art class (nothing fancy).Recently, me and my table group (2 dudes, 2 chicks) were assigned a group project where we had to design an inspirational poster to hang up around the school.Part of the assignment was to make the poster have an illustration, so I came up with the idea that there should be a man climbing a mountain (symbolism for the quote) contrasting against a sunset background.For more context, it was a weeklong project and I was gone a day, leaving the other 4 (who told me they knew how to blend) to make the sunset themselves. I came back to 4 bricks of color behind a mountain. I spent the entire class period sacrificing my free time (when I could’ve been finishing the assignment that was due next period) to revive the sunset. I ended up fixing it before the end of class and it turned out nicely.But that isn’t what triggered me. I could’ve lived with carrying the project on my back for a week. I even could’ve lived with the fact that they commented on how terrible the poster looked the entire class period and that they hung my art in a corner so that no one would see it and they didn’t have to be associated with it. I would’ve been annoyed, but okay. In fact, the only reason I thought they didn’t like it was because of the poor blending, so I fixed it without comment.What set me off was that when I asked why they thought it looked bad, they had the audacity to say it was because it looked like A GAY PRIDE FLAG. They were shitting on the art the entire time just because it looked GAY.I mean, how absolutely miserable do you have to be to look at THE COLORS OF A SUN SETTING OVER THE HORIZON and just think “Ew, it looks gay and disgusting. I hate it.” To me, it was absolutely fucking ludicrous and BIZARRE to have be condition to such a dystopian way of thinking and it infuriated me.Naturally, I was livid. I confronted them about it and how I think we should move the poster but they argued with me until the bell.

My whole friend group hangs out in the theatre at lunch because it is quieter than the main cafeteria and all of us are some form of neurodivergent, lol.

So you'd think, \"oh, it's okay, you can just see them later.\" The only problem is, I share none of my classes with my friends, so lunch is the only time I can see them. It's gotten to the point where I just sit and eat alone while my friends play because they get very loud and even sitting next to them playing it causes a lot of anxiety for me.I am the only one who doesn't want to play, and I feel like I would be the asshole for asking them to stop, so I can sit with them.But I also feel like me being upset that I'm the only one who can't be around them is valid because they are choosing to play this game knowing I don't like it and knowing I feel bad whenever they do.I might be the asshole but please, let me know?

She also stated that we would be FINED 50$ for any of the following:Not helping to set anything up (Aka mandating after-school time even though last year's class got to ditch class all the time to work on it)Not participating in the Haunted House or concession stand (we also hosted that)Not staying after the festival to clean up.Now, let me make this very clear.

Now, she says nothing about it and barely gives us any direction at all. But THEN I get a message in the class gc at 5PM on a SUNDAY saying that we would be staying after school that following Monday. Aka the NEXT DAY. That proceeded for the two weeks leading up to the festival, and on the day of, she shamed me and my entire group (who are all busy and have our own LIVES) for not staying after school to set up. I made it clear that I was happy to stay IF I HAD NOTICE so I could miss work. I didn't get any, and unlike her my job PAYS me for my time. She also mandated everyone stay after school that Friday (DAY of Festival) to help set up. She DID give us notice on that so I could stay, but then we worked it for THREE hours with the only break being when some kid outside had a seizure for 3 minutes. THEN, at 9:20 PM (Festival ended at 9) they say we're all going to get \"walking tacos\" (1-serving dorito bags with lettuce in them) and then STAY TO CLEAN EVERYTHING UP. At this point we had gone from noon to nearly 9:30pm without any food and only a few of the small plastic water bottles.I fully admit, I ditched and went home.That Monday I was confronted by my class sponsor that I had to stay after school to clean up or I would be fined. She made me miss actual club time that I actually HAD signed up for, and she's been oddly rude to me since.

Coffee is brewing and kid #2, who is on day 2 of having pink eye, is eating breakfast. Kid #1 had a sleepover to help prevent the spread and another sick kid. My wife began disinfecting and airing out the house so we could pick up #1, and I went to the bathroom for my morning .Upon returning from my glorious purge, about 20 min later, I close the windows thinking we've sufficiently vented the place while the heat is still on on this cold winter day. Wife comes into the room and bristles upon seeing the closed windows and snaps at me that not all the disinfectant has cleared out. I perceive her tone and delivery a bit too aggressive - especially considering the context and the fact we could simply open the windows again - so, I tongue-in-cheek joke that her attitude is just as toxic as the disinfectant. This really revs her engine and she goes into a lecturing frenzy about how insulting the word \"toxic\" is and is appalled I would call her such a thing. The smartass that I am counters that I a) didn't actually call her any name or insult her, but rather  described the way she was coming across, b) wasn't aware \"toxic\" was on the naughty list of words, and c) her attitude is unwarranted and I would appreciate it if she would take note of the way she's speaking. In response, she doubles-down and continues to be oh so offended I called her toxic. At this point, I understand there's no reasonable/rational conversation to be had, so I try to drop it and go the other way; however, now I'm apparently being disrespectful because I'm not trying to understand her side. Thus, a circular argument about the argument ensues which I generally just don't take seriously and consider a waste of time and energy. Unsurprisingly, the dismissive sentiment and my defensive sarcasm (seriously, it felt like I had just called her a cunt) fuels her rage further and she begins crying and yelling about my disrespect and disregard for her as she heads out to retrieve kid #1 from her sister's. After a brief moment of relief, she proceeds to 'text bomb' me and lecture me how I \"don't get to decide how my words make others feel\" and \"Maybe consider how you could have made me feel instead of how you may have meant for it to come across. Take into consideration other external factors, the way I'm already feeling etc etc.. but really seems like you don't take anything into consideration like that\". Apparently, I am able to mindread and contemplate all possible phrasing and word choices within the blink of an eye...I believe I would understand and accept her response had I actually called her some insult, but \"toxic\" to me is harmless.

I write that she has no reason to be acting this way towards me.Eventually she comes back but she is now really angry at me because of those messages it takes some mory crying from her and convincing from my side but eventually we sleep.

Of course he said yes and that he can’t wait to see what Snowflake brought this year.Kelly overheard this and asked Alyssa about it. Alyssa then told her all about our tradition from Snowflake. My brother in law has been texting us since Christmas Eve night saying how we’re too much with Alyssa because now they’ll also have to do that with Kelly or Kelly thinks it’s because she wasn’t a good enough girl that year. I feel awful my niece has been crying thinking she wasn’t good enough but my husband and I never meant for any other child to feel that way. Jack also told his brother he’s not going to have us stop doing something for Alyssa just because he can’t do it for Kelly.The family is divided on their opinions. My mother in law is trying to keep the peace and my brother in law is saying my husband and I are both AH for going too over board with everything making him have to with Kelly or she thinks she’s not good enough.So AITA?",

She came over and physically forced the cookie out of my hand and told me I can't eat it. I asked why and she said it is because you just can't eat late a night.Other times when she caught me eating late at night I asked the same question but more lightheartedly and she said the reason was because im fat. I tried to tell her the time you eat something docent affect the amount of calories it has but every time I say it apparently I say it too nonchalantly because she just docent reply or brushes it off.However, this time around I was serious and I pulled out a article that said that the time you eat docent affect affect the calories. She once agin didn't want to look at it and just walked away but I was serious so I followed her around holding up the article on my iPad and waited for her to look up. Instead of looking up she just got really really mad at me and said \"fine, eat, eat all you want I don't care, I don't know about science, just eat it then\" but she still wouldn't tell me the real reason why I can't eat late at night and just kept yelling at me to eat it if I want to which scared me so I went upstairs and slammed my door.She then followed me upstairs and forced me to pick something off the ground that had fell off when I slammed the door and continued to yell at me that she didn't know about science and I should just eat it. She then told me dad to come upstairs and talk to me with the excuse that he was fixing my fan and when he left he also told me to stop eat at night because im fat enough already.

I gave my parents a Christmas list of things I need for my apartment and life. I emailed it to them when they asked me to. Great. Fast forward to today. I was the only one to buy the pets presents. They view the pets as their own kids and say all these wonderful things about them. But the treat them badly behind closed doors, ie, not taking medical emergencies seriously, not giving them new toys when old ones need replacing for safety reasons, etc. My Stocking had 6 mini candy bars and 3 dollar tree trinkets. There's had king size bars, handmade gifts, vintage knick knacks, etc. My Stocking not being full is a running \"joke.\" One year I got a lighter and a half eaten crunch bar. I was 13. Please don't see this as spoiled. My parents had each 20 plus gifts while I had 6. All th8ngs they asked for, personalized gifts, the works. I got a box of ramen, items from my 2020 shopping list and a new air fryer. This air fryer. Omg. I was told to inspect this air fryer in person, online, in a magazine, a video, multiple times before picking it. I was exhausted by the time Christmas came. They don't match my energy with xhristmas and it's so disheartening to see. Last, I wanted to watch a movie. Dad was gonna read, mom was gonna nap and we all hang out together. She stated for 3 minutes, tops. Dad has to read the yahoo news articles for 1.5 hours before coming In to sit on the other side of the room with his book while I watch my movie all alone. Mom wants to make it up to me by buying me everything I want that was on my list. I'm not giving her the chance. I did buy the pets presents and things they needed and will use.I'm returning all of the gifts that they gave me tomorrow. Am I the asshole in this situation?

	"title" : "AITA for causing a sweet old librarian’s mental breakdown?",
	"body" : "Hey so I never post on Reddit, but after all this happened I thought the internet might find it as crazy and I did, and also I could use the advice.I (27F) recently started a new job working with kids at a local high school working with kids. I was situated in the library and worked very close to the librarian (65ish F), who is a sweet and friendly older lady. I was nervous about fitting in but she (let’s call her Susan) made me feel comfortable right away. We would chat sometimes when it was quiet and after a month or so I felt comfortable enough to ask her questions like: “Hey Susan do you think I should set up a desk in this corner?” Or “Susan I brought this little cabinet so I have somewhere to lock things up.” She seldom complained or criticized, and when she did (like when I kept forgetting I can’t eat in the library) she was always polite about it. I thought we were on friendly terms. I was wrong.A few weeks ago I overheard a Susan and a student talking about book recommendations and, in an effort to be outgoing, I joined them. Susan pulled the student away, and I got the message and sat back down. A minute later Susan approached me and she. Just. Exploded.I was shocked. The kind and friendly librarian was in my face, aggressively calling me inappropriate and unprofessional. She said I “didn’t belong” and to “sit at your desk, work with your students, and leave everyone else alone.”I learned later that she went home and broke down. She called the principal crying because she didn’t want to go back to work while I was there. She said I was terrible to her and I was ruining her job by being in her environment. In the end I was almost fired before somebody actually asked my side of things.So now I am just. So confused. I just can’t reconcile this version of me with my past behaviour. I like Susan and I genuinely thought she liked me. But while I thought we were getting along, she was staying up all night crying about how much she hated being around me. I work in the hallway now because Susan can’t stand to have me in the library anymore.So AITA for unwittingly ruining Susan’s work life? Advice would be appreciated because I legit don’t know what to do about any of this.EDIT: here are a few things I can clear up.I work with the ministry of Education helping support students taking classes online. This is a new position because the government just made this online school, so there's no precedent of where I should work, and it's been a learning curve for me and the school about the specifics of my job description.Also, the school board is PISSED at the ministry of Education for spending so much money on their new fancy online school at the same time they slashed the school budget so much they had to lay off 1 of every 2 librarians. I know Susan is super stressed about this.I may be socially awkward, I may be clueless sometimes, but I am NOT unkind.",

	"title" : "AITA for not buying my girlfriend flowers?",
	"body" : "My (33M) girlfriend (28F) have been together for almost 4 years, but only began living together just over a year ago. Before that we were long distance and I used to send her flowers for special occasions and sometimes just because. I often spent a good deal of money on a dozen roses. She was very grateful and would say how when she looked at them it reminded her of me and made her smile. It might be worth noting she never brought me flowers, but that didn't bother me as its a bit of a girly thing (no judgement or whatever, but honestly I could care less about flowers).Anyway, now to the issue at hand. Since living together I haven't brought her flowers - honestly I hadn't really thought to, because I'm right here in the same flat and so she doesn't need a reminder of me. Well just before Christmas she brought a Christmas flower arrangement, which I figured was just part of decorating for christmas. Early January she threw it out, and in its place appeared another vase of flowers, which I didn't say anything about because she was not working (she's a private school teacher and was off for their Christmas holidays) and I figured she's just bored. But I guess they died and now there's another vase of flowers in its place, and this time it's a dozen roses!I asked her what was up with the roses, and she said she likes flowers and that as I never buy her them anymore she has decided to get them for herself. I didn't say anything at the time but this has really got to me questioning her. It seems really passive aggressive to go out and buy roses for yourself just to make a point (literally identical to the arrangements I brought for her!). And now every time I walk into the kitchen I am hit with how shitty a boyfriend she thinks I am.Edit: I appreciate the comments, even though some of them were hard to swallow.It seems the jury is split, I’m either an unloving asshole because I've overlooked an obvious hint to gift my girlfriend flowers and make her happy, or I’m a self-absorbed asshole and her purchasing flowers isn't anything to do with me. Either way though, it seems like I’m an asshole.",

	"title" : "AITA for asking my husband to cook food more to my taste?",
	"body" : "I (37f) asked my husband (40m) to cook food that I like and have been buying ingredients more aligned to what I want to eat. He says IATA because I complained. Backstory is we have a baby 8mo. The last year and a half he’s been doing all the cooking because I was pregnant and working a lot, recovering from a hard birth and struggling with breastfeeding the baby. The issue is not that he is upset about doing all the cooking. He’s upset that I complained and bought different food. For example, I asked him not to make anymore plain pasta and peppers with sausage because we’ve eaten it so many times times, and I bought food to make quiche because that’s something I like and miss cooking. I might be TA because this sounds ungrateful, but I just miss cooking myself and making foods that I like. I simply don’t have time because I do more baby care. I had him look this over so it isn’t biased. So, AITA?EDIT: Just to clarify, his dad is a very involved father and overall amazing husband. We’ve tried to switch off and have me do cooking, but our baby wants to breastfeed almost constantly in the evening because he “tanks up” and sleeps 9pm-6am (yes, we have an amazing baby). I cannot just “pump” as some have suggested because I would need to pump every time he eats to keep up my milk supply. I am a “just enougher”. We both do not want me to give up breastfeeding just to cook as it’s better for the baby.Another edit: My husband is a better cook than I am. He just likes different food and we’ve had a lot of repeats due to staying in a budget (as you all know food is ). I did try to buy food I like and send him recipes and he likes to cook the food he likes to cook. Also, some of you really don’t seem to understand the commitment and time that breastfeeding a baby takes. It’s a lot of time! We both work full time, and feeding the baby takes me 3.5+ hours on weekends and 2+ on days he is at daycare for most of the day. That doesn’t include the time I pump right before bed when his dad is putting him to bed. Breastfeeding and pumping is a full time job.Hopefully last edit: My husband wants everyone to know that his repertoire has been limited by little freezer space (I made a breast milk stash just in case), food is super expensive/he’s been trying to stay in budget, and he’s making sure I get the right nutrients for the baby. He also thinks I could have asked more nicely and the way I said it sounded like criticism. I own that. Maybe I am slightly TA.More: Wow. I’m sad to see so much judgement for our feeding choices, which was not an issue here at all. Neither of us feel it’s worth me cooking to do less for our baby. And yes, I am a former low supplier and exclusive pumper who worked my ass off to put milk aside in the freezer (waking up at 3 am) just in case my supply drops again and currently I can pump just enough while at work, but have been advised by lactation consultants that if I supplement with my stash my supply will drop again and I should keep it for emergencies until he’s closer to a year. All this has nothing to do with what my husband is cooking. For those of you saying just pump and bottle feed, I do not respond to a pump like a baby and that would actually take more time than breastfeeding. Not everyone can just pump for 20 mins and get a lot. My breastfeeding journey has been very very challenging but we’re committed to it and in no way think it would be worth changing so I can cook different food. That’s just not worth it.So: People still insisting we could trade off. That’s exactly what we tried to do with the quiche. I bought the stuff for quiche, I attempted to make the quiche while he watched the baby. Baby is starving in the evening and was screaming for me. Husband had to take over making the quiche and was not happy because it’s not something he usually makes and feels comfortable making, despite being a good and experienced cook. So we’ve accepted that he has to do the cooking.",

	"body" : "I (19F) have two younger brothers (16 & 8).  We’ll call the sixteen year old T and the 8 year old A.  A is diagnosed autistic and ADHD with possible learning difficulties.  We suspect that T has ADHD, though he isn’t officially diagnosed, and I am diagnosed autistic with anxiety.Because of my autism, I’m not good with change and I have unnecessary emotional attachments to a lot of my belongings.We have lived in our house for about eighteen years, and my bedroom and the office are extensions put in by the owners of the house before us.My parents and I have the two biggest bedrooms, and my brothers have the two smaller rooms.My brothers rooms are boxes what with all the stuff that’s in them, with A’s room being the smallest.Seeing as I’m at uni and in the dorms for three-to-five days a week, my dad wants to move T into my room, A into his room (it’s slightly bigger than his current room), and me into A’s room.A is not yet aware of this plan, but T is happy about getting a bigger room.  I wasn’t consulted on the idea and I don’t want to be moved to a tiny box room.I have a loft bed (T’s old bed, he now has a double bed) and it’s going to be difficult to have it in a smaller room with lower ceilings.  I also have a large bookshelf (I am a big reader) plus two small tables (I have a Lego hobby), a wardrobe, a beanbag, a dresser, and two desks with both placed under my bed.One of my desks is for uni work/Lego/my laptop, etc.  The other has my PS4, Switch, my TV, a stereo, and all the games and associated accessories for my consoles.Both of my brothers have far less in terms of books and the like.  I wouldn’t be able to keep all of my stuff in A’s room and I don’t want to take my parents’ suggestion of putting most of my books in the loft (attic) for three reasons:I have severe fears and anxieties of going into the attic.  All of them are irrational.I have no spatial awareness and I am very clumsy.  Our ladder is very old and rickety and requires someone to hold it to make sure it doesn’t fall while someone is climbing in and out of the attic.Generally things that go into the attic don’t come back out, normally thrown away a few weeks after being put in there.  I am speaking from personal experience.  I am very emotionally attached to all of my books and read them regularly.So it would be extremely difficult to access most of my books and my parents would likely throw most of them out without my knowledge (they say I have too many).I’m being called selfish for not wanting to change rooms and I’m being told that it’ll go ahead whether I like it or not.AITA for not wanting to change rooms?EDIT: Consensus is that I’m TA.  I fully accept that title and I’ll apologise to them for being selfish about the situation.  I think there were a few people who were a wee bit harsh in their wording (I’m sorry, I am a people pleaser who starts crying whenever someone even remotely shows any hint of being mad or annoyed, I’m pathetic) but you guys have been really helpful with helping me try to find alternative places for my books to go! I feel like I should specify that every ND person in my household is bossy and controlling, I just try not to be as much.  This room issue is the only thing where I’ve been really selfish and controlling because my dad is the type of person to make a decision, give no room for negotiations, and expect everyone else to blindly follow along.  The fact that there‘s been a lot of change lately (which I don’t do well with), plus the fact that I want one private space to be mine (there has been a lot of bedroom changes or furniture swapping in bedrooms with basically no notice before) sorta tipped me over the edge and I went on the automatic defensive to try and keep my space.  I plan to talk to my dad about getting rid of some of my youngest brother’s toys that he never uses to make room for another bookshelf downstairs where I can move most of my books, as well as apologise for being a selfish control-freak and to explain how I felt about not being consulted or negotiated with about this at all.Again, thank you all so much, you were all amazing!:)",

He said that I can't hide from everything I don't like, and that I need to be more adventurous. I told him I have tried the green beans, I just don't like them. He got offended, saying that I need to start \"liking more things.\"A jumped onto S's case and started defending me, saying things like \"He just knows what he likes,\" and even said \"You can't talk about being adventurous, you don't leave your room.\" (For context, S graduated and rarely leaves his room. He doesn't have a job, can't drive, and isn't in college.) I told A not to talk to S like that. However, I told S that he can't be mad at me for not trying new things when he hasn't either.S got really upset with me and started being transphobic toward me. He deadnamed me, I got teary eyed, I called him an inconsiderate ass, and said I understand why he is moms favorite because nobody is going to love an ugly c*nt like him. S tried to push me down, but I pinned him against the wall as he laid his hands on me. My dad heard the noise and came running towards us, and saw the scene. I let go immediately, and S started saying I was beating him up. A told Dad it was all over green beans.My dad is disappointed with S because he hurt me over something so simple, and S is mad at all of us.Dad and A said I did nothing wrong, but I know they both baby me since I'm the youngest. I'm not mad at S because I know he didn't mean what he said. Honestly, I feel horrible for hurting him physically and mentally. I just don't know if I should address the issue or apologize. Am I the asshole?Update: S has apologized! He came into my room and we talked. I also apologized for hurting him and not handling it better. We had a conversation about how deadnaming me is super not cool, and about how what I said and did is super not cool as well. A then came to my room to ask for something and joined the conversation. Everyone has apologized to each other about it, and we all understand what we did wrong. S said that he wants to learn to drive but isn't sure where to start, and A said that he will help teach him alongside our dad. Currently, S and I are talking about entry level jobs and resumes since i'm the only kid currently working. I showed them both the post, which led to S opening up to us about his mental health. We all had a heartfelt conversation about it and how we can all support each other better. Of course we are still going to get into dumb fights (we're teenage boys and we're brothers), but hopefully nothing like this again. S wanted to say thank you to everyone who helped point out the signs to me. Tomorrow, S and I are going to talk to our dad and step-mom about what S wants to do. A would be there with us, but he is leaving for his dads house (I forgot to mention A is my step-brother, but I really just see him as my brother). Thank you for everything y'all have helped with. You're truly great people! Also, if my dad decides to write down the recipe for the green beans, I'll definitely make sure that those who asked for it get it.",

Over the past few months, I've come to notice a few concerning things.Jane started writing webnovels online in high school and it has continued into university. She makes decent money off of it now but I mean it's seriously affecting her life tbh, she doesn't go out or do anything and since we moved out of the dorms her social life is now non existant. Our course load is pretty heavy and involves a lot of lab work and assignments, so our parents pretty much pay for everything as getting a part time job would be too much, but Jane will stay awake till like 3 AM writing on the daily and then pass out on holidays, which cannot be healthy.Our families spent Christmas together and I happened to find out that Jane's parents think she stopped writing in high school, cause they were never all that supportive about her 'wasting her time'. I've suggested sleeping and eating properly to Jane cause I can't stand watching her wear herself out like this but I'm \"not her mom\".I mean, she fell asleep during class for the first time yesterday and also constantly looks like shit, so I'm considering telling her parents that she's absolutely ruining her health, cause she just won't listen to me, but she'll likely listen to them.

Now remind you I’ve lived on my own since I was 18 due to the military.. my wife and I were kinda hesitant to move in with my parents but honestly we had nowhere else to go.. we were promised that we would be taken care of until we got back on our feet.. we were home for about a month and a half with no mention to anything then all of a sudden my mother is filing for bankruptcy (because she has a terrible Amazon problem) there was a little talk about possibly paying rent but I was told it would be half of there mortgage,electric, and half internet and cable (neither me nor my family uses the cable)  (my parents live in a double wide that pretty much paid off) and after that she required that I start paying 600 DOLLARS a month for literally 2 beds and one closet in PA.. (because she has my closet packed full of shit probably from Amazon, oh and REFUSES to let me get rid of it so I can actually hang my clothes). She has just recently requested that we start getting our own groceries as well but when she talked to us about the rent she told us it was included.. my question is should I just take my family and actually go struggle away from the toxicity that lingers around her or what should I do? Me personally I think 600 a month is a little steep for 2 bedrooms and the house isn’t even to myself and my family.. I personally don’t believe we should be paying anything because we were promised help not told we would be required to pay rent because you can’t manage your own funds.. and the whole time all this shit goes down my dad just backs my mother no matter what I’m about to the point where I just load my family up and leave.. AITA?EDIT: I forgot to mention the part where she’s been trying to pull the wool over my eyes and saying I owe her more money than what I do.. she tried telling me that I owed her $1800 for a couple months rent I was behind but ever since she mentioned the rent I’d been paying her.. she also lent my friend money which he payed her back a long time ago it was like $300 which she swears to this day that he never payed her but I was there the day she got the money.. it seems to me like she’s just money hungry.. also she has access to my bank account and knows how much money I have so she will look and see what she can get away with.. so she’s making it impossible for me to save and leave.. for everyone saying I should be helping and there expenses went up Your right they did the expense of electric and gas for the furnace that’s only used 3 months out of the year my parents have a well for all there water and a septic tank so no there expenses went up MAYBE 100 For electricity..

For a while my parents and sister had been bugging me about getting a haircut because they were talking about how ugly and messy it looked and how I would get bullied and would look like a girl, except I really liked how it looked at the time. So on the day we were going to get a Christmas tree my parents had booked for me to get a haircut without me knowing, so the only real option was just to go along with it. After the haircut I felt AWFUL about my hair I thought it was so bad, when we got home we were going to start decorating the tree soon, and this part is the part I feel really bad about and makes me think I may be the asshole, when I got home everyone commented on how much better my hair looked but I didn’t like it so I complained about my haircut a lot whenever they said anything about it. Eventually my dad got really upset and called me ungrateful and stormed off to his room to calm down, then my mom sat with me on the couch and started to apologize and say that she shouldn’t have booked the haircut especially if she had known how bad I felt about it, but my sister was not having it (she is slightly transphobic but I don’t think this was about that) she started yelling at me about how I was ungrateful and ruined Christmas decorating (which is a pretty big event in my family) and I should should just be happy with it and grateful that I even get to look slightly like a boy. At this point I started crying and went up to my room, not wanting to stay around my sister when she’s like that and soon my mom came into my room and apologized again and said how she just shouldn’t have brought up my haircut and she would love for me to come back down and finish decorating when I’m ready. I said that she was totally fine and it was more of me and my sisters fault for causing all of this. I eventually went back down to finish decorating, my dad had already came down and was decorating the tree with my mom who was telling him how they really shouldn’t have booked the haircut and they did it more for themselves than for me. My sister at this point had gone into the living room to watch the office and refused to decorate saying I had ruined her mojo. I started decorating but it was really awkward as I could feel that my dad was still angry with me, at one point I couldn’t take it anymore and went into the bathroom to take a break. From in there I could hear my dad still talking to my mom about how angry he was with me. When I got out he told me from now on he wasn’t going to book appointments for me anymore and it was up to me to decide when I want them prevent this from happening again. I feel like I made a really big deal about nothing and that I might be the asshole here.",

I used to have socials, but it wreaked havoc on my mental health, so I deleted them. Not only am I isolated online, I was homeschooled from age 10 to 15 so I've had minimal experiences with friends, and quite literally zero experience with dating. Hence, this post.As I'm so closed off from the internet, the only way for someone to contact me is with my phone number or email, both of which feel quite personal. Because of this, my parents came up with a system if anyone ever did show interest: I ask them for a photo for their contact before giving them my number. This was mostly for safety (if they say no, then it's a no for my number, if they say yes and end up being creepy, I know what they look like), but it's also nice to have a contact photo right away. It seemed like overkill to me when they suggested it, but I trust their judgement (especially when my dad has a 'dad moment' where he goes on a BENDER telling me how much he cares about my safety.)Long story short, I was on the streetcar minding my own business and this guy sits down across the aisle from me. Now, the streetcar was basically empty, so I saw him out of the corner of my eye, and accidentally made eye contact (which was awkward enough for my social inept ass). I just sort of awkwardly smiled and then looked down at my book again as fast as humanly possible. He then says hi, I say hi back, he asks me a few questions, (What's your name? How old are you? What school do you go to? etc.) it's all going fine, which for me was a HUGE surprise. We talk for maybe, five minutes then he asks me for my snapchat. Now, here's the part where I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong or not.Well, I did the plan, told him I don't have social media, said I could give him my number but asked him if I could take a photo for his contact. He then got very weird. He leaned back in his seat, and told me that was weird, and an invasion of his privacy. Then he flipped it on me and asked me how \*I\* would feel if someone I barely knew asked me for a photo. I told him I honestly wouldn't mind, as it really doesn't seem like that big a deal to me, but he told me I was just trying to rationalize my unreasonable question.After that I just said I was sorry I'd offended him, sat awkwardly for the next couple of minutes then got off since it was thankfully my stop.

So I guess for context me (20F) and my boyfriend (23M) have been together for 4 years, our first two years together we're really nice, our first Christmas together he got me a bunch of stuffed animals and candy, our second year together he got me more stuffed animals, I always try to get him similar things. Our third year together I asked for a used PlayStation 2 for Christmas as I like retro gaming, and when we exchanged Christmas gifts I asked for that and candy, he had asked for pajamas and candy. Since we lived together at this point (and he's not good at hiding gifts) it's like 2 weeks before Christmas and I notice he hasn't gotten me anything yet, I like at him and ask if he's gotten it yet, he told me no, a few more days pass and I get worried because I'd be a little sad to not get to open anything on Christmas so I bugged him again, at that point he told me I was entitled for thinking I deserved anything for Christmas, I ended up crying and the next few days I begged him for it. looking back I shouldn't have acted so childish, but 4 days before Christmas he ended up buying me one and it came 2 days after Christmas, I ended up really liking it and I still use it. This Christmas just came up and I had asked for a big fruit spread, ex dried figs, candied oranges, chocolate oranges. I really like candied fruit and stuff and I thought it would be fun to have one on Christmas, I'd also thought it'd be nice if I could share it with him and other family, he ended up telling me it was too expensive (60$) and I'd have to pay for half and set it up myself If I wanted it, I didn't mind and I did. I gave him a 40$ pair of shoes he'd been wanting for Christmas. Now my birthday is coming up as well as Valentine's and I told him I'd really like my nails done and dinner, and if he can afford it a new stuffed animal, I know it's a lot and would probably be over 200$ for dinner, nails, and a stuffed animal but I was hoping maybe he would do it. He ended up telling me all he does is buy me stuff and Im entitled for expecting so much on my birthday. I don't know if it's wrong to ask for things on Christmas or birthday as I'd always directly tell my parents what I'd want when holidays came, and when his birthdays come I always try to do something nice for him, ex for his 23rd birthday I bought us tickets to the zoo, ice cream, and dinner. My parents stopped giving me gifts and stuff when I turned 18 and I don't have many friends so maybe I'm just asking him for too much.",

Because of the timing of the surgery and the fact that I got it scheduled the day after I got back, I decided to give my sister (16F) 50$ to get my mother (52F) gifts from local stores, including a summer sausage that is the only thing my mother says she cares about getting. My sister went out and got a bunch of gifts that are very obviously from her while I was incapacitated from surgery. Now, my parents have been divorced since I was 12 years old, so my sister and I are responsible for both of their gifts and by the 23rd, we still didn’t have anything for my father (52M). I felt like I had recovered enough to get a gift for my dad just so he had something. It wasn’t anything big, just a funny bumper sticker and a t shirt, but at least it was something. I went to get that gift by myself because my sister does not want anything to do with my father due to his absence in her life in particular and our mother has not left her with the best impression of our dad. Now, come Christmas morning, we all open gifts and everyone was very happy and I thought nothing of it other than thanking my mother for what she got me and showing my appreciation. Everything was fine until this morning. I got up this morning to find my mom looking very angry. When she saw me, she immediately started grilling me about what I got her for Christmas. I was very confused so I told her that I delegated the getting of her gift to my sister and she got really upset about that. She brought up that I had gone through the effort to get my “absentee father” something but I did nothing for her.

Since then I have been making it clear to my family that change really throws me off and for holidays if things aren't going to go as they usually do, I need to be told well in advance. It can be very upsetting for me going into a situation I haven't been in before and I need some time to mentally prepare myself.In my family, on New Years Eve we all go over to my grandma's house, eat KFC and play cards until the ball drop at midnight (a simple tradition, but it's important to me). I was expecting this to remain this way this year as no one mentioned anything changing, and as of writing this post, New Years Eve is in 2 days.Well, last night I receive a text from my sister asking if I wanted pizza from one place or another. I respond I don't mind, and that was all, I figured she meant tonight (day im writing this) since we are having pizza for dinner.Today my mom texts me asking if I'm having pizza for dinner. I respond with yea, I told my sister I was yesterday. My mom tells me that it's for new years Eve. I'm super confused at this point, so I just say, no, new years Eve is KFC. Always has been. So I walk out of my room to talk to my mom in person, whos on the phone with my sister.My sister begins shouting at me over the phone and saying that everyone decided on pizza for dinner on Christmas after I left early and so when she texted me asking about pizza I should have known she meant New Years Eve. I was like, what? No, you never mentioned a day, and if you know we're having pizza the next day you should have specified.Now my mom and sister are very upset with me and I'm currently holding myself back from panicking. I know it seems like a nonissue, but I've made it clear to my family how important holiday tradition is to me and that if things are changing I'd like to be told so I can prepare. I've always had a hard time adapting to change and, I am working on it in therapy, but I'm not quite there yet.I just wish my family was more sensitive and didn't just assume I know everything.

	"body" : "No you do not have permission to republish my post.So I work as a programmer working for a small government Dev team.  I needed to have some elective surgery done and so my family decided that it would be best to do it between the holidays.  While I would be prepping on Thanksgiving and recovering for Christmas, I would be home for both holidays.  I'm WFH so this wouldn't be a major issue but it would mean that I would be working except for Thanksgiving day, Christmas Day, and New Year's Day.  The other two developers would have time off during the holidays.My wife works for an international company is also WFH but also flex-time.  She interacts with Asia and Europe so it is not uncommon for her to be working in the evening or early in the morning.  She took this week off to spend time with our daughter.  She has some health issues which can make it rough to get around sometimes.Sometime yesterday, they decided to celebrate Christmas with one of my daughter's friends by going into the city to the aquarium.  Okay, cool, have fun.  Last night my wife had a rough night sleeping, so she didn't get much rest.  She asked me to take a sick day to take the three of them to the aquarium.  Now what you have to understand is that I am almost hyper ethical.  After childhood, the only lie I ever told is to my daughter about Santa, the Easter Bunny and the like.  Anything more than change that I find, I turn into someone in hopes that the money will be found by the person who lost it.  I'm not naive enough to believe that someone at the store may not keep it themselves, but to me it's not about what others do, it's about how I live my life.I wouldn't have a problem if my wife was sick.  That is what sick days are for.  But this is not that.  Yes, she sometimes has problems sleeping but she is also prone to a bit of exaggeration.  I deal with insomnia.  Often she says that she got no sleep but I know that she slept a good portion of the night even if she was up and down a lot (there are easy to hear indicators she makes when she is asleep).  Not restful sleep, okay, but sleep.  I understand that it stinks to have to deal with that situation.  When she works with oversees offices, she asks me to sit with her, as dislikes being up at night alone.  On those nights, I usually get about 3 hours of sleep before I have to deal with work.  I've stayed up prepping the car for road trips, slept 2 hours and then drove 10 hours. (I cannot sleep in cars).  I told her that I couldn't do that.  No one is sick and there isn't anyone that can cover for me right now.  There are certain things that have to be taken care of by law at certain times.  She feels that I'm giving priority to my office when I feel they gave me priority when they covered for me for the 11 days I was out at the beginning of Dec. to have my surgery.So AITA here?EDIT:  Cannot reply to comments as my karma is too low.  Beginning judgement is that I am TA, which I can accept if that is the case.  I will say however that my statement is not meant on how much sleep that she gets.  It was more that there are plenty of situations where she will ask me to work on a short amount of sleep.  I do so happily, even knowing that it is going to be a pain to work the next day.  I get a bit upset, wrongfully maybe, that she starts looking for outs when she is  in a similar situation that I didn't have any part in.  If that makes me more TA, so be it.  I'd rather know that I am one and change then deny the truth.FINAL EDIT:  I want to thank everyone for weighing in.  The conscience is that I am TA.  While most of the posts conflate things that should not be associated, there were a few that pointed out that I my reaction may have dismissed her feelings which I see is a valid point.Point of Contention:  Her health issues are mobility related, not sleep related.  The issues that crop up from time to time are regular issues, she sleeps wrong and pinches something, drinks too much caffeine before bed, etc.Extra Information:  I just learned this from my mother-in-law when she woke up just before lunch.  Apparently my wife, daughter, and her did not make it to bed until around 3 this morning.  I left them watching movies at about 12.  I normally leave the light on so my wife can see when she comes to bed and sleep with a blanket over my head to shut out the light.  I woke when she came to bed and reached out and rubbed her until she fell asleep.  I woke up one other time and rubbed her back to sleep again.  I don't know what times those were as I have learned I can quickly go back to sleep if I don't open my eyes.",

	"body" : "I was in Walmart with my extremely hard to handle children (8, 3, and 1). My 8 year old daughter tells me she has to use the bathroom and honestly I needed to go too. We went to where the bathrooms were but the family room was locked. I waited a minute but she really had to go. So, I bring the 3 kids in to the women’s restroom. My oldest takes her 1 year old sister in with her and I took my 3 year old son into my stall. My 3 year old is hard to handle and even with my protests he continues to crawl between stalls. A lady walked in to use the restroom and at that point my son was waiting by the sinks. He then says “where’s mommy?” and looks underneath the door to find me. He accidentally looked underneath the door and saw the other lady. she scoffs and says “UGH! Will you get your kid?!” I tell my son to stay with me and of course he doesn’t listen because he’s a rambunctious 3 year old… I hurry to finish and tell my son that was rude and we need to go. As I leave I tell the lady I’m sorry I have 3 kids and had to use the restroom myself. She said “ I don’t care how many kids you have! That was just rude!”. I then said “ OKAY…! I said I’m sorry. You don’t have to be so F-ing rude yourself!”I do have to say I didn’t see this lady face to face but she sounded like an older boomer lady. Idk if that gives anyone any insight… Not meaning this in an ageist way just as context that maybe she’s had her own children in the past.{I’ve actually been on the other side of this situation before children and I didn’t get angry. If I said anything it would have been most likely to the child and would’ve been “Oh you should stay with mommy..” or “ Ugh oh, don’t do that.” Nothing as far out as this woman did with the yelling at me and my son. I acted on impulse and momma bear came out. Everyone is saying that I am not taking responsibility for my child, but that is not the case. I let my children know that that is not OK.I understand that people don’t know me and don’t read everything or understand but I don’t think I’m a horrible parent. I’ll take my loss because maybe I should’ve turned the other cheek and let the lady yell at me.I thank all of you who offered constructive criticism and support. I apologize to anyone I offended. It was never my intention and I am not that type of person. Maybe you knew someone who was as awful as you feel I am and I’m sorry for that.}",

	"body" : "I (24F) am getting married in about four months. I have a friend, Jessie (28F) who has a horrible track record with guys.Her ex cheated on her and left her. Since February of last year she's probably been through 5 or 6 guys. Everytime she ended it. And the last one was horrible. She kept saying that he's the one ect ect. We met him and he genuinely seemed nice. I decided to give her benefit of the doubt and said that he's cool she should keep him.Then a month later she dumped him. Apparently he wasn't valuing her time. I don't know why I was suprised obviously this is a pattern now.She recently met up with an old friend of her that chased her years ago but she shot him down because she felt like she didn't deserve someone like him. But she admitted that she always liked him. And apparently, this is \"the one\". I've heard this so many times. Worst part is she plans on emigrating to another country to be with him. Let me clarify they've been official for a month. I can't believe she's going to drop everything here for a man she's barely known for so long. Her friends, family and security just down the drain because of a man she apparently \"loves\".When she told me that she plans on emigrating in 6 months (my wedding is in 4), I laughed and told her I'll remove her from the guest list if she's serious about this. At first she thought I was joking but I'm serious. I don't want someone in my wedding photos that will be MIA for the rest of my life or that is willing to give friends and family up like this.Now she's calling me controlling, weird and saying that she doesn't want to attend my wedding if this is my attitude. This is also spilling over into my relationship because my fiancée is good friends with her and he's saying he'd very much like her to be here, that I'm being weird.For context: She is a very close friend of my fiancée, and I am closer to her ex. So unless he (the ex) is going to emigrate too, he's invited as well.But it's my wedding. So AITA",

I use to get 8 plan b pills per year (now I only get 2) but I’ve mentioned this to my group of friends and whenever they need plan b they always come to me. Which I understand but it’s my stash and I’m in college and like to have fun (responsible fun but ya know shit happens) I like to keep the pills handy for when I need them cause things happen and I wanna be prepared. Well during this time of my life, slip ups would happen so I would take a plan b. This left me at only 2 or 3 pills left. My friend also 20F has been messing around with a guy in our friend group. They never use protection and have had some scares. The whole friend group knows about all that. We tell her that she needs to start using condoms and she says “yeah yeah I know” but continues not using one. One day me and a few of my friends are getting breakfast and she texts me asking for plan b. I read her text out loud to everyone cause at this point we told her so many times to use protection and still hasn’t. Everyone at the table says things like “don’t give it to her” “she needs to learn her lesson” “he needs to buy it for her” and I kinda agreed (I’m also just a very influenceable person and will listen to anyone’s opinion/advice) so I tell her that I’m all out and I don’t have any so she buys it herself. All is good no babies around here. Almost a year later someone that was sitting at the table during breakfast told her recently that I had plan b the whole time. So she texts me a paragraph saying how she’s going to look at me differently now and how upset she is at me for lying. I understand her being mad at me for the lying part, I get that but when it comes down to it they were MY PILLS and I should choose what I want to do with them. Am I the asshole in this situation?",

	"title" : "AITA for turning up at a friends house at night?",
	"body" : "This is gonna be a little complicated, but Im really conflicted.Last week I went for a walk with some of my friends at night. We wanted to clear our heads and have a nice talk together. We actively didnt invite some of our other friends since we knew they wouldnt want to come or were asleep. So we kinda just roamed around the neighborhood.We had the idea to show up at one of our friends houses. Jokingly, I took a photo of their house number with the caption \"we are gonna get you\" to let them know we are here.Normally, this friend is more on the joking side, making fun of everything, but also can be quite weird sometimes. Weird in ways of them accusing me of mental abuse and ghosting me for months after I sent them a photo of me and some others partying, even though we have been like besties the previous weeks (and they could have come along too).To my surprise, they didnt take the joke well. Some time later, they thanked me for telling everyone where they live and making them panic. I responded way later, as the notification didnt pop up and  apologized. Though I told them that 1st, everyone knew already their location because we are, like, friends, and 2nd, if they really did panic, they could have called me asking if we are serious or not.I was kinda taken aback. I was expecting them telling us something like \"get lost\" in a joking manner, or waving out of the window and thats it. Not panicking about us, breaking in? Throwing stones? Staying there for the whole night? I dont know what they were expecting.They later told me I've crossed a boundary, resulting in a sleepless night. If I had known, I would never have done that. But again, they could have called me for reassurance. Though they responded with \"well I thought you were drinking\" because I didnt see the notification and a friend of us asked if we were drinking, to which another one responded with \"yep\".If we had been friends for about a year or so, I'd understand that they wouldnt notice the sarcasm or have issues trusting me. But we've been friends for 7+ years, some of them they were even in love with me. And I made it clear enough that I never drink, ever. Still, they had no trust in me nor our other friends, one of them also against drinking. We are normal people, living our life without partying often or causing scenes. They are supposed to know that by now, or so I thought.So why would they not trust us and think of the worst case scenario, without asking if we are for real?Our friendship is over because of this, and they said some really nasty things, some of them contradicting each other. They seem like a mess mentally, and had I known it was such a big deal, I would never have done that. Some of my closest friends think they are overreacting and having, again, one of their emotional bursts.Still, I'm trying to understand their point of view.

	"title" : "AITA for wanting my boyfriend to throw away a big plastic bag that he has used for 20 yrs?",
	"body" : "I (24 f) have been dating my boyfriend (26 m) for 4 years. During this time he has been using a large plastic bag to hold various things such as handheld game systems, games for the systems, wires, and other small things that he did not want to lose. This year i have decided i want to start fresh and get rid of any unnecessary things. I was able to convince him to put the things that were in the bag in other storage places but he does not want to part with the bag. Because “it is reusable, durable, and perfectly fine.” It is dirty and wrinkled from use. We are currently in a stalemate about this fucking bag and need another opinion. This is not going to end our relationship but it’s driving us both crazy. Thanks in advance.UPDATE: He has claimed his undying love for the bag, magically packed all his things in it and left me! You all have shown me i have no respect for my relationship and im a horrible controlling person. Thank you for the wake up call.JK heres some answers to your questions and some context since i didnt realize i shouldve been more detailed rather than concise. We currently stay in a fairly small room with a small closet for storage. I have a lot of stuff i need to get rid of and so does he. Just things that take up extra space in our small living/storage area. i have gotten rid of TONS more of my stuff than his and i always ask before i do ANYTHING with his stuff. In the four years of us dating i am always the one to purge both of our old things. With permission of course. If not we would be living in a landfill of our own. Now to last night - He was going through his things to find a small 3DS Part and asked me where the bag was. I told him it could be 1 of 3 places but it was most likely in the closet. He then began to go through his things and eventually found the bag. When i have gone through everything and asked him what to do with the bag previously he said to keep it so i did no questions asked. This year because i am in the mindset of reorganizing and cleaning i decided to ask him why he has kept this bag for so long and why this bag was so important to him. Now here is where i will describe the bag. This is not an opinionated description of the bag, just facts. It is over a gallon size wise. Has a plastic zipper at the top and has one of those warnings on it so your children don’t suffocate. Its like one of those bags you would receive in a package or would hold all those small tools you get when you build a new table. In my brain its not something I would keep. In his brain its useful. we were making jokes back and forth about the bag how he was in love with it and when he was 70 he would pull out the bag and tell its great history etc. and in the end could not agree what to do with it. We decided to make a post on here to see is it useful or i am being an asshole. At first it was funny and he was getting a great laugh being proven right but then it went downhill FAST and we decided i should probably post more context. I am not the controlling type, we were not in a heated argument over this bag, and THE BAG STILL LIVES!",

	"title" : "AITA for Telling My Sister It Was Rude To Send Me a Wedding Dress Pic?",
	"body" : "Context- my sister is 2 years younger than me (I'm 37f) and is getting married. She and I haven't spoken very often for the past 4 years and certainly don't have deep conversations. Due to my family continually gossiping or being judgemental I told them 15 years ago after my first boyfriend any I broke up that they wouldn't be told if I was dating someone until it was serious. To be fair, while I tried online dating for years and have my share of bad first date stories, it's never gone beyond that until this year.I have been dating someone for over six months. Knowing that my sister was talking about getting engaged and was planning a very short (3 month) engagement, I decided to tell my family that I was in a serious relationship.  I also wanted them to meet my bf over Christmas.  I didn't want to just show up with a date to family events without letting the hosts (one of my older sisters and her family) know.I called my older sister in the morning and she was completely okay with meeting my bf. I was excited to share about him. :) that afternoon, my younger sister texted me that she could have gotten a free size 4 wedding dress from Facebook marketplace (in the city I live in) and I asked if she wanted me to pick it up for her. She said no, it wasn't really her style but it would have been fun to try on. Plus, she was waiting for the dress she'd ordered online to arrive. She then sent me a Screenshot of a size 12 wedding dress for $80 with the caption \"Here's one for you. Lol. I've tried clicking Facebook to show me less but I haven't been successful yet.\"I assumed that she'd found out from our one sister I dating so I sent back a pic of myself and my bf. While she had been immediately responding she now took 4 minutes to respond with, \"Who's that?\" I told her \"my boyfriend\". She said, \"He looks happy\".I got on the phone with her and asked if she knew I was dating. She said no, she was surprised to hear it. When I said she was rude to send a wedding dress to someone she thought was single and had been for 15 years she told me that I was the one with the problem and she had sent it to me because it was obviously too big for her and something I could actually afford.I told her congratulations on her upcoming marriage and that obviously we still have difficulty communicating with each other. We both have talked to our sisters and mom about this situation and while I know it's silly, it bothers me that I was told I was the one being rude when I called her rude for sending it. Aita?Edit- after reading the comments I think it's clear that it's not a simple issue. Some people understand why I was hurt and felt like she was rude. Some people see her side that she was trying to connect and agree that I was rude. I do try to take a step back in situations where I feel emotional. I truly appreciate every single one of you that responded. Life is complicated and emotions even more so. I don't need to know if IATA anymore because the reality is both of us have things to work on. I know I need to not take things personally and at the end of day- this is a ridiculous thing to be upset over when there are so many more truly life altering things to worry about. I'm going to just keep being happy that she's happy and move forward.Edit 2- the history with this particular sister is that she regularly has made fun of my weight, job, looks, clothing choices, etc. One example is telling me that if I ever wanted to start dating I'd need to slim up first because no one would find me attractive where I'm at. Some additional context below. -I'm happy with where I'm at physically- I'm a body builder and had several serious injuries from car wrecks last year but I'm doing great just being able to walk and starting to workout again! Yay!my sister and I slowed communication because she wanted me to join a dating app just so we could swap bad date stories and make fun of the people we met. I told her I didn't find it fun to make fun of people and it's also one of the reasons I didn't want to talk about who I dated until it was serious.my sister had announced she was getting engaged 3 months before. I wanted my family to meet my bf at Christmas for two reasons: most important, we are serious and I would love my family to get to know him. 2-I genuinely didn't want to take attention off my sister's big day. I thought it would be a huge thing to show up with a serious bf at her wedding that no one knew about and would take the attention away from her. I 100% did not want to do that.I'm currently a12/14 street clothes which is a16/18 wedding. My sister is a0/2 and is altering a size 4 wedding dress smaller.As I said in my previous edit, I've realized it really is a ridiculous thing to be upset about. I'm happy for her, I'm hoping she has an amazing marriage and that she is super happy for the rest of her life. That should and will be my focus going forward.

We’ve had many bad episodes until one day there was such a bad episode bordering on abuse (throwing things near me) that I gave an ultimatum to stop drinking. Since then, he hasn’t stopped drinking completely but drinks comparatively less (not to the point of getting piss drunk where he remembers nothing the next day) and is not as much of a mean drunk.The problem is that a few times the past week he has gotten piss drunk again and while nothing bad happened, it gave me PTSD that a bad cycle may start again. He told me that he would stop drinking completely and he’s a new leaf (he is moving to join me in a new city). However for this weekend he requested if he could drink for a road trip with his friends. I said no. However this week I also got promoted and my friends were thinking of a celebration.I would like to preface this by saying I am not a drinker (I will have like two drinks in three months). I’m also a workaholic and right now really feel like blowing off steam by having a drink or two with my friends, something I usually avoid doing since I’m so cautious monitoring my partners intake. So AITA for asking him not to drink while not completely stop drinking myself?

I, however, go to school every day, my days end later than theirs and i cant skip classes. They decided to meet up at 1pm when i could probably get there at 3:30. They invited me as well, but i told them its inconvenient for me, as i would get there so late that they would probably want to leave soon, and that i was hurt and upset by the fact that they did not consider my circumstances in this situation.This ended in a fight between me and the three of them, who think that its not that big of a deal, but im mad at them because i feel left out. Am i making a big deal out of nothing?UPDATE: I read the comments and apologized. They accepted my apology and im omw to head over now, as its not too late yet :) Thank you all for the feedback",

	"body" : "I will try to put as many details as possible.I (28f) have recently (at the start of this year) received a promotion at work, taking my ex head of the department who was finally fired due to a lot of gross misconduct. As I was very happy about this new opportunity I have posted on my private social media something along the lines of \"keep on doing what you do, karma will take care of the rest\". I thought nothing of it and a lot of people congratulated me on the promotion in the comments. However a few hours later I started to get really mean and hateful comments calling me all sorts of names.I was confused and started investigating what happened since the comments came from people I barely know or don't know at all. I have asked some close friends and one of them sent me a link to \"Anne's\" (29f) profile. Anne took my post as if I was \"gloating\" over her child being in ICU and being born with some problems. I didn't even know I still have her as a friend.Now the reason why she believed so comes from the time we were in college (over 10 years ago now). We lived in the same dorm and once went out, where Anne got very drunk and started saying a lot of insensitive and mean things about me, mainly about issues I had with my health when I was born and spending a few years in the hospital and ended up with a few very big scars. She believed I was exaggerating the problems I had and using them to get attention since I wouldn't wear certain clothes due to bad scars.I haven't communicated with her since college. Had no idea what was happening in her life since I wouldn't see any updates about her on my social media. Turns out her kid was born with the same issues I had and I have posted the same day the kids operation was due and when she announced his issues publically(which again I had no idea). I have messaged her and explained the post and have asked to stop spreading misinformation, but she wouldn't listen and called me an asshole. Since then she also gave an interview to a local newspaper so despite setting social media to private I am still bombarded with hate and people calling me an asshole.",

I understand why your teachers say you are hard to teach, because you won’t f***ing listen!” (I have mild autism, it is hard for me to learn. I had also started crying when she started yelling).

My wife is very kind to my daughter and they are quite close. My daughter has very little memory of her mom and has told me how nice it is to feel like she has a mom now. My wife is also happy to play that role in my daughter’s life. I’m not as close to Sophie, because she’s older and she spends  two weeks a month at her dad’s place. But she’s polite to me and I think she’s a wonderful girl.Sophie’s dad is pretty well off, my wife and I are less so. He was the main earner before my wife left him. My wife and I both work full time, but we have to be careful with our finances right now. We got my daughter a few books and Sophie a dress for Christmas. Both of them liked their presents. Sophie’s dad got Sophie a brand new car. We have only one car in the family right now, I drop my wife off on the way to work in the mornings, so it works out. But it does mean that I couldn’t take my daughter or Sophie anywhere during the holidays, as my wife still has to work. I have the week off because I’m a teacher. (She did have a few days off though.)Now that Sophie has the car, she is planning to go to her friends’ New Years party. My daughter asked if Sophie could drop her at her friends’ house too, and Sophie said it’s too far out of the way (extra half an hour approx) and it’s her car, so my daughter can wait until she’s old enough to drive. I thought this was uncalled for, so I said Sophie was being rude and she should drop my daughter. She said it’s not her fault I can’t afford another car for us.My wife said I should just let it go, because my daughter has a dad all the time and Sophie only has one half the time, and a car is fair compensation (not the right word, but I can’t think of a better one) for that. My daughter and Sophie are both upset now - AITA?Edit: I suppose you are right, it’s her car, she can do what she wants. I just thought it wouldn’t hurt her to think of others this time. My daughter asked very politely and Sophie often has much nicer things than my daughter and I’ve never asked her to share or anything. And I pay for all her gas while she lives with us.Edit again: 30 mins extra means 15 mins out of the way, 30 mins total. An hour is a lot of extra driving, I agree. I can’t reply to comments because of the poo mode, so editing here. To the person who said ask nicely - my daughter asked very nicely and Sophie literally said I don’t have to do anything for you. That’s why I said she was being rude. I’m not forcing her, I just said I think she should. To the person who asked if I broke up their family - Sophie’s dad cheated on my wife, twice. So maybe… think before you speak? I might be wrong here but there’s no reason to overreact.",

	"body" : "My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years and lived together for around a year and a half. I have a son (5) and have full custody.My bf has 7 kids. He has custody of his youngest 2 (10M/8M) every two weeks. His eldest son is in his late 20s and visits every few weeks with his own kids. His second oldest son is 20 and lives full time with us, he works full-time and pays rent.It's the middle three's (17M, 16F, 14M) visitation that causes issues.They have rooms at our house, some visits/custody time is scheduled but most the time they'll randomly show up when they want. Sometimes this is fine, but it also causes issues.A mundane issue is food. I never know how much to buy for the week because I could be feeding 3/5 or 6/8. Many times, I've had no snacks to give the younger boys because the teens had stopped by unannounced or been in the middle of cooking dinner when one of them shows up. Other times they plan to visit and bail last minute and I'll ending up having to waste food.The unannounced visits also cause disruption to the younger boy’s routine. Sometimes it's just stupid stuff like the boys being kept up by their older siblings or being over excited when they show up before bedtime. The issue happens the other way round and they get disappointed when the teens flake.I've previously brought up my dislike for the unscheduled visits to my bf but he doesn’t see the issue and blows me off.However, we recently got into a big fight about it. All bf's kids were supposed to be at their moms for Christmas. The youngest 5 were scheduled to be with us from the 26th.My parent, 2 sisters, BIL, and 2 nieces stayed with us from the 22nd to the morning of the 26th. This allowed for my family to have space in the house as we only had one kid. My parents are also not the biggest fan of my bf and don't like the number of kids he has so I try to schedule their visits when they aren't around.However, on the 23rd the 17 y/o storms into our home after a fight with his stepdad and says he's spending Christmas with us. I tell him he has to sleep on the couch because my parents are in his room, and he throws a hissy fit and basically sulked for the next few days. On the 24th 14 y/o called his dad and also wanted to spend Christmas with us.I didn't want him to because we didn't have enough food/space, and I had originally planned a seperate Christmas for bf's kids on the 26th. We argued for a while, but BF went to pick up his son anyway.It caused issues like I knew it would. We ran out of food and there was lots of tension between my mom and 17 y/o. He kept going into his room to get stuff and wanting to play on his computer. She told him off multiple times for being rude.This morning I was complaining to my bf about how they made Christmas so stressful for me and that he needed to get the kids to schedule their visits. He told me I'm being an asshole who just didn't want his kids around for Christmas. I disagreed as it's a year-round issue.",

My wife, on the other hand, has traveled all over the place, lived in multiple countries, and is always planning the next big adventure.This really hasn’t been an issue for us. I do travel with my wife probably once or twice a year, usually staying a little closer to home. Otherwise, she travels with her family or friends. She always invites me on these other trips but I rarely go. While I miss having her around, it’s a good arrangement. She gets to do something she loves and I get some alone time to unwind at home. She’ll send pictures, we FaceTime, and she usually brings me back some cool souvenirs.All of this to say, there’s one trip she takes every year and I’m starting to get uncomfortable about it. She goes, by herself, to the same place every year and it’s non-negotiable. When she’s there, I hear from her way less than any other trip. She’ll send pics and we FaceTime but less often. When she gets back, she’ll give me snippets of information but I don’t get a full day-by-day run-down.This trip predates me - she first went to this place in college and has been back basically every year since. She’s told me several times how much this place means to her. But my problems are as follows:The trip is non-negotiable. She’s had lots of trips change, get cancelled, or not materialize but never this one.I’m not invited.It feels secretive, like she doesn’t want to share it.This place isn’t not exactly a tourist hotspot. It’s not what you would think of as a vacation destination and there aren’t a lot of sites to see - even according to my wife. So why the need to go back 10+ years in a row if there’s not that much to do?I’ve brought it up to my wife but she can’t see where I’m coming from. The issue being that we have the money, we have the time off work, and we still have a great relationship outside of this. I even asked if I could accompany her some time but she accused me (probably correctly) of only wanting to go to keep tabs on her because I, under any other circumstances, would have no interest in going to this place so, according to her, it’s either my “insecurity or ego” that’s trying to keep her from her passion.I get where she’s coming from but it also seems crazy to me to be deliberately unwilling to include keep your spouse in something like this.",

One of the people I met in the first week of school is an international East Asian girl - this will be important later - we can call Amy. We get along really well and are in the same friend group, but ever since the start of the year, Amy has made various comments that have made me extremely uncomfortable, and, quite frankly, seem racist.The first instance came on a hot, sunny day early in the school year when my friend group went to a local park. All was well as we walked there, but half-way there Amy asked the entire group if anyone had an umbrella, to which we all said no. When I asked her why, she said that she \"didn't want to get any darker\" than she already had gotten. For reference, Amy was about as pale as it gets when this happened. The rest of my friends - white or asian and all from the US - seemed shocked and uncomfortable, but I chalked it up to just being wary of sunburn because I didn't know her well yet.Just a few weeks after that, though, Amy and I were watching videos of K POP stars when she exclaimed how great their skin looks. I told her that when you have a makeup artist as professional as they do, anyone can look amazing, but, without breaking eye contact with the phone, she told me she was talking about how white their skin looked. This time I could feel a rising anger in me, so I asked her why it mattered, to which she said \"in my culture it's the beauty standard\".If you were wondering, I am black and have had to brush off all levels of racism because I am from an all white city. Part of me had hoped that by going to a university of my school's caliber and diversity, I might not have to deal with it as much, but is seems I was naive, and have heard various other comments from her regarding this same topic. I genuinely can't tell if she is oblivious to the fact she is saying white skin is the \"beauty standard\" to a black person or if she knows and doesn't care. The next time she makes a similar comment, I really want to tell her she's being offensive and that her culture's standards don't justify whatever she says. WIBTA in this situation?Edit: After some very helpful comments - thank you so much - I have definitely pivoted my stance of her comments being racist.

	"body" : "This happened while staying with my parents over Christmas.One night I (41m) went to bed earlier than my parents (~23:45), and just as I was falling asleep, I heard my mum (66f) talking loudly as they came to bed (~00:15), as if no-one else was trying to sleep.  My dad was being quiet; it was only my mum's voice that disturbed me.The next afternoon, I gently asked my mum if she knew how loud she was when she came to bed, and she said \"no\", so I let her know she woke me up when coming to bed.  Rather than apologize or even acknowledge being loud, she just said \"I don't think we were that loud\" (I corrected her on \"we\"; it was only her), and then when I told her she was loud, she starts some whataboutism about the dehumidifier being loud anyway (it wasn't bothering me; she was).By the end, she still never apologized or expressed any intention to try to be quieter in future.A few days later, she was getting frustrated while trying to do something on her phone.  This irritates me because she won't stop whining about the problem, but also won't let anyone else help, and she's terrible with communication.  She doesn't read error messages or explain the actual problem; just keeps repeating \"It's not working\" while not letting anyone else try to solve it.Even my dad was getting frustrated, so I told her I can only help if she either lets see the problem myself or improves her communication skills, otherwise don't bother me with it.She replied that there's nothing wrong with her communication skills, so I brought up how poorly she handled me telling her she woke me up, and how she never acknowledged or apologized for it.  So then she started getting upset about how we (my dad and I) were always \"picking on\" her, as if she's the victim and guilting us to feel like we're bullying her.  Then she went to bed and didn't talk to us.The next morning, she acts like nothing happened.  But similar things have happened many times in the past and she makes no effort to learn from it.  I've even mentioned this, but she'll say things like \"I'm too old to change\", which I interpret as \"I don't care about you and I'm not going to make any effort\".  AITA?",

	"body" : "Hi. I (29m) and my wife (27f) have been married for 3 years so far, and never had many problems before. However, we're in the middle of a huge fight which I think could've been avoided.I am an avid gamer and spend a good bit of my free time playing video games. My wife also plays some video games, but not as much as I do. We often play different types of games (ex: she plays sims I play COD). However, we always make sure to spend a lot of time together and have hobbies outside of video games.Recently I've been playing a game called Stardew Valley. (For those who don't know what that is, it's a peaceful farming sim with a very expansive co-op system). I've loved it so far, but none of my friends have it. It seemed like the type of game my wife would like, so for Christmas (along with other gifts) I bought her Stardew Valley.We opened our Christmas gifts with my family this year (we spent Christmas with her family last year), and she seemed polite then, but when we got home she was livid. She said the only reason I got her Stardew valley was so I could have someone to play with, and I wasn't thinking about her at all. I explained to her that it was more than having someone the play with, that I thought it was something fun we would both enjoy together. She said I should've got her a $15 Steam gift card instead, and let her choose what game she wanted to play. I explained to her that I felt that gift cards were impersonal so I promised myself I wouldn't use them when gifting, and the point of my gift was to spend time together using (what could be) a mutual hobby. Eventually, she just stormed out yelling that I embarrassed her in front of my family. I was confused because she gave me a really nice \"gaming keyboard\" last year. (It was very obviously for playing games as we then discussed the video games I play, and more). She has not touched the game so far (I sent it as a gift via Steam during Christmas) and every time she sees me playing it she gets in a bad mood. It's made me stop playing it altogether because of how mad it makes her. Every time I try to discuss it she ignores me.So, AITA for buying my wife a game that I like?",

About 2 hours ago I got picked up by my friend (let’s call her Leah) and her friend (let’s call her Sarah) in Sarah’s car. The plan was just to go to Target and hang around and chill. The second I opened the car door I could literally feel the smell of weed seep into my skin. (For reference I don’t do any sort of drug/smoke/drink etc.. I’m a 20YO male and my Leah just turned 21 and Sarah is 19). My friends know and respect my choices about substances and I with theirs; I have been around them when they smoke outside and in the car. But when I sat down in the car it felt so heavy and dirty and on top of that Sarah was hacking and coughing and not covering her mouth. I don’t know if this is relevant but I spent 5 months in a hospital for contamination OCD. It helped me in so many ways and I’m grateful and usually I’m able to ground myself in situations like this. It wasn’t even 1 minute in the car and I had to pull up my shirt to block the smell. The two of them were in the front and I sat behind Leah who was on the passenger side. We had gone to Target and then Taco Bell and I suggested we eat inside because I didn’t want to have to sit in the smell but we ended up staying in the car. I literally couldn’t eat my thoughts were racing and I literally went nonverbal. They began to ask me what the matter was and I said I was tired. They sort of brushed it off and talked for about 20 minutes while I didn’t say a word and was just on my phone. I got the sense they felt worried and confused about what was going on with me. They kept asking if I wanted to eat the food and if I was ok and at this point I was getting overstimulated and didn’t want to breath inside the car anymore. I am a major people pleaser and didn’t want to be rude by saying I wanted to go home and Leah said do you want us to drop you off and I said yes. It was mostly quiet the rest of the way home and when I got dropped of Sara said a meek bye and Leah didn’t say anything. I feel awful and texted Leah what happened and she hasn’t replied. I got home and immediately took my clothes off threw them in the wash and took a shower. I acknowledge I need to work on things when it comes to exposure therapy but I was not expecting what happened tonight to happen. AITA for acting the way I did and seemingly ruin a good night?",

My parents feel I'm putting them in an unfair situation having to choose between me and other peoples reactions but I feel other peoples reactions are their responsibility. My dad said his foster son is also not welcome on Christmas, due to him insisting on bringing an assault rifle which would also make people uncomfortable.I still feel this goes deeper than a desire to carry a gun and that it's unfair since nothing I'm wearing would be unusual on any other women in the family, not to mention hormones change your body and I would not look normal in men's clothing now.

I was totally okay with this, but I was worried about her being in my car.I have a very bad fear of bugs. Because of that, I bug bomb my car every season (every 3 ish months), fill it with mothballs, spray every inner/outer inch with Ortho max and use a chlorine diffuser placed on the dashboard. I understand that my car is a gas chamber on wheels, but my reasoning is that it’s better to cut my life by 3-5 years compared 50 years in a deadly car accident. (I almost killed my myself multiple times endangering myself and others due to bugs in my car). Doing all this seemed to stop all bugs from appearing, I haven’t seen them for 2+ year so I do this religiously.so I let J know beforehand if she is okay with all this. Warning J all the things I did to the car and even letting her “testing” the inside of the car if she is ok with it. She said it’s all good. We also made the agreement that she won’t roll down her windows. She told me that’s fine, as the ride home is only about 15 minutes.As we were otw, J mentions that the smell is worse than she thought of, and asked if she could roll down the passenger window. I told her sorry but no, and brought up that we agreed to have the windows up. About a minute later, she just rolled the windows down. I panicked and rolled it back up. Then she started telling me that she’s getting dizzy. Now this is where I feel like a real asshole. I think I slightly gave in and rolled it down about 2mm of space. It was sunny outside, and I was afraid of potential bugs coming in.I dropped her off and J called me a weirdo psycho. I understand that this is not normal, but when choosing between a friend vs phobia, my mind automatically goes to my phobia. I absolutely despise my fear.As I am writing this down I definitely feel like an asshole. What do you guys think?Edit: I guessed it but majority votes AH. Going to apologize to J today. Some of you mentioned that this could have been all avoidable if I just didn’t let J in the car in the first place. I think from now on no more passengers for their own sake",

So, as you can probably tell (and with gender roles exacerbating the issue) we fight a lot abt messes. I have gotten a lot better bc some of the things I agree are just too much to be mad at sometimes like whatever a shirt or a pair of shoes can sit out for a little bit. But what my husband is failing to understand is that with OCD and just regular old being a woman, we start to get resentful when we have to asked over and over again for the same shit. So, my husband never grew up with real christmas trees bc he is allergic. Well, so am I and we always had real christmas trees, you just touch it with gloves! So, about 2 weeks ago I had a day off from work (I work nightshift 4 days a week) and I decided to take down all the christmas decorations myself. So then I said to my husband “i want to take the tree out today” So here comes the issue, instead of just saying yes it either comes eith an excuse or a questionhim “well what are we going to do with it?” me “throw it in the dumpster like we did last year” him “can we throw it in the dumpster?” (we have the same apt and same landlord) me “yes we did it last year” him “can we do it later i don’t wanna do it today” me “well idk when else we are going to do it i work the rest of the week and then we are going away to visit your mom for the weekend”but my first mistake here was letting him ask to do it another day, we should’ve just done it then but I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubtNow, its 2 weeks later, 2 weekend trips passed, and the tree was still here. Now being beyond frustrated I said “we are taking the tree out now” and he said “well there were gloves here where are they now” so then i flipped out. Yes ik screaming and yelling are not condusive to have a conversation but i’m not a quiet and timid person. i had to go to intense therapy to help control my compulsions and anger so tbh I’ve come a long way bc 3 years ago I would’ve just cursed him out for telling me no the first time.But I said “no I don’t know where your gloves are, you had two weeks go find them” and then I got impatient waiting for him to find the gloves so I said Ill just do it myself and ripped the tree out of the stand and started dragging it out of the house myself.Now my husband is saying i’m overreacting bc i wouldn’t let him find the gloves and that i’m mean and this all could’ve been avoided if i had more patience.Can someone pls just tell me am i the asshole here for losing my patience???",

My hometown has some vocal bigots and T has echoed some of that sentiment over the years. We are black and R’s friends are white. We live in a well off area. I’m a scientist (PhD) for a government contractor and my husband has a MBA and owns a consulting firm.When we first met T at R’s 7th birthday she “jokingly” asked how we could afford our home and if we were drug dealers…it was awkward but I let it go. It is a lazy stereotype to imply black people with a nice house are criminals. I assumed she was just awkward or nervous. Over the years she has made “jokes” about me being “light skinned”, saying I’m an affirmative action hire, how it is easier for blacks to get into college than whites, etc. I have tried to question her logic but I confront her bs with more patience than she deserves so R doesn’t lose a friend. Part of me hopes that she grows/learns from our interactions.I grew up poor and black around poor white people. I understand that class oppression is real. I am certain T has experienced the oppression of capitalism but that doesn’t mean that I also haven’t experienced it just because I am better off now. I spent most of my childhood living in a trailer park. It was not easy being black and poor in rural America.Bs family are very wealthy and I’ve never heard T say a single thing rude in their home. Although she did initially have ann issue with B taking part in the sleepovers until As mom pointed out that they are kids and B is openly gay. As parents are working class white people. As mom has spoken up a few time when she heard T say racist nonsense. We’ve never talked about it directly but As mom and I have shared a few poignant looks over the years.All of this makes me unsure what R will experience at Ns house. I won’t be there to protect her. N is a kind child. Her and R are close and I trust my daughter to pick good people. I don’t want to punish or isolate N because her mom has problematic views. N doesn’t seem to share her views. N has talked to me about how she wants to be a scientist and asked questions about grad school and my job. My husband agrees with my concerns but doesn’t think anything will happen. I haven’t said anything to R, just that I needed to check our schedule next weekend.I think I’d be an asshole for causing drama and tension between a group of 12 year olds who just want to have a sleepover. WIBTA if I made my daughter miss this sleepover or should I not cause drama for R?",

	"body" : "I apologise for any errors, kinda writing this post in a desperate state so I'm sorry.6 months ago my (24F) best friend Tess (26F) asked me to be her Made of honour for her wedding. We have been friends for years now and I love her a lot, she has always been there for me and we've been through a lot together.The one thing Tess was the most excited for was her bachelorette, she has been talking about it even before she got engaged (which is why I feel so guilty). I also helped her plan our vegas trip and we were supposed to leave this week.But a few days ago, Jason got laid off of work. Even though he saw it coming, it hit him hard. He's just  stressed and really upset. He didn't even tell me at first because he didn't want me to be worried but when he finally told me I just knew I couldn't go anymore.I was really conflicted, and I knew what this meant to Tess and that I'm the MOH, but I just couldn't even consider going to vegas while Jason is this upset. He's a strong guy but I felt like he shouldn't go through this alone.I worked up the courage to call Tess and it just went so much worse than I planned. Tess thought I was joking first, and then she just became really angry which is understandable, but I wish she understood my situation too. Tess at first told me to do whatever and cut the call, she didn't respond when I tried contacting her again.After that she sent me a lot of messages saying that I'm stealing her special day, and started questioning why I accepted to be made of honour if I didn't want to do the duties that came along with it. She said I'm untrustworthy  and jealous, that I'm ruining her special moment for a guy I've only known for a year.I'll admit, I usually don't accept Tess's offers to go clubbing and she blames that on Jason being controlling, but in reality but I've explained that, I just turned into a homebody because I never really enjoyed that stuff in the first place. I  still go out with her a lot, I make sure I'm there for her. But for her bachelorette I was willing to do that and more. I really did want to go and make it special.She told me that her whole plan will fall through, because I was the one with the plan. I told her I'll explain it all to one of our other friends.But she said I don't have to because I'm no longer her friend, that hurt a lot to hear.One one hand, I don't regret my decision, Jason needs me and Tess should understand how difficult this is for us. But also, this is a once in a lifetime trip, and she has been dreaming about it since forever. I'm also the one who planned a lot of the stuff. Our mutuals also reached out to let me know that Tess was very angry, and that what I did was not cool.Now I'm doubting myself, and I need to know if I have to apologise.I obviously can't ask anyone I know, Jason thinks I'm right, and I'm sure Derek and the bridesmaids think Tess is right. So that is why this post. Thank you, if you are trying to help me.",

	"title" : "AITA For telling my friend’s girlfriend that she makes our group uncomfortable?",
	"body" : "My friend, Chris and I have known each other since middle school. We became very close in high school. We are 25 now. He has only had one short term relationship years and years ago. And has been unsuccessful overall. Fast forward to almost 2 years now, he has a girlfriend who I can’t stand frankly.He met her off tinder, and at first all of us were so happy for him. Since he spent years chasing after me when I told him, I didn’t like him that way, but he insists that I gave him mixed messages.  For a while, I thought it was just a crush. But I guess it was more than that as he used to send me love letters and wanted to listen to my problems and help me out with everything. Maybe the lines could have been blurry idk.From the first time I met her, I’ve tried to be nothing but nice to her. But there was just this weird energy about her. I guess the first thing that threw me off is the fact that she’s not super outgoing like all of us.  Every time he brings her around, she won’t hang around the girls of the group during concerts. And only hangs by him like a lost puppy. She doesn’t ask about us, or wanna get to know us and only talks to people who talk to her first.I guess after she found out about him being obsessed with me, she has an issue with me. She doesn’t talk to me, hang out with me, and just really acts shady. Like they’ve been together all this time, we don’t know anything about her.Overtime, Chris began to get more and more distant with me. Until I asked him what the problem was. He told me that I wasn’t good for him, I broke his heart, and his girlfriend is the most important person in his life now.A few weeks later, I see them at a show, and I go up to his girlfriend when Chris is in a different part of the building. I told her that she makes everybody in the group uncomfortable, I don’t want Chris, and just pretty much everything I said here.  Trying to squash the beef. She wasn’t having it and told me she wasn’t being disrespectful she was “just existing” and walked away.He texted me the next day after she told him, and he was so mad at me for saying that. But she blew it all out of proportion.",

	"body" : "Long story short we ordered takeout from a local Asian restaurant. They do hibachi, mostly Japanese, but they have some Chinese dishes in their menu too.So I called and asked if I could do their Lo Mein, and they said yes. I saw they had an extra chicken option, and an extra sauce option. I asked for both but the man I spoke to argued, complaintively, that there was “lots” of chicken and more sauce would make it soupy. I suggested that I prefer my Lo Mein saucy, to the point that I should be able to spin a fork or chopsticks and not pull up more than the noodles I’d touched - maybe not authentic idk, but it’s what I grew up on.He sort of seemed upset at the idea that the base dish wouldn’t be correct, so I relented. House style is fine, then.I also ordered crab rangoons, and my partner asked me to see if they did Kung Pao. I asked if they did Kung Pao, and he got kind of… weird? He laughed, maybe awkwardly, and said “this isn’t a Japanese dish, I don’t even know what it is, no.” Ok, strike that one we’ll stick with what we ordered.Anyway I go to pick it up and suddenly he starts complaining to me, saying that it’s rude to ask if they carry Chinese food, and that it’s not polite to ask for modifications. I said it was on the menu, and I didn’t think it was a big deal, and that they had other Chinese options so I was just curious. He doubled down and said they didn’t carry Chinese food and that I was either mistaken or trying to cause trouble.I was done. I just opened my package of Lo Mein, pointed out that it’s a Chinese dish, that it had very little chicken (small stringy pieces, maybe 3 visible at the top, and a fork turn showed no treasure trove hidden) and that it all moved together and wasn’t very saucy.I just said thanks, but no, and left (to myself, I admit I didn’t say it out loud I just turned and left). He followed me out and told me I had to pay, and I said that I wasn’t taking it with me and he should have listened to what I wanted the first time, and maybe not gone off about me asking about a dish.I didn’t pay, but I didn’t take the food. My husband who was there when I called doesn’t think I’m in the wrong, but our friend who showed up thinks I should have paid and just never gone back, even if I didn’t like the way the food looked. To me, I think, if I’d have sent back the food sitting down there, I don’t see a reason to pay for it if I’m not sitting there.AITA?",

I have played badminton casually for a while now at a school sports hall 1 min away from my house. When I was with my ex occasionally we would play together at the hall.When we split we did have a conversation about whether he would ever continue to play and he said that he probably wouldn't and definitely not near me as its 40mins drive away and he said that was too far to drive for a game and there are venues near him.Since the split (I am still healing) I have thrown myself more into the sport and have even joined the club at venue and go a several times a week. I have been really enjoying it and the distraction. It has been a really safe space for me.On Tuesday he he messaged me saying that he was now planning on going to the venue to play badminton. I asked him why he was going to play at my local venue. He said that he had a friend that lived \"this way\" and he wanted to play. I asked why it had to be THAT venue as you can play at any sports hall. I can think of 5 locally even to me. You can basically play at ANY sports hall.I told him that it felt weird for him to suddenly come to a club that I play at as to be honest I never want to see him again. I just want to move on without him in my life.I would never just start going to his gym as there are loads of gyms about and I personally would deliberately avoid going to a gym he went to! I think that's breakup etiquette!Obviously I can't tell him what to do, but I don't understand why he would even want go to a venue 40mins away from him that I regularly go to when you can play at any sports hall.I cannot go to another venue to play as my club is based there.He basically told me that I was welcome to join him to play (wtf?!)

I said \"I don't think these are supposed to be tumble dried\" and then looked at the label \"line dry in shade only\" and said yes it isn't supposed to be tumble dried. Then I noticed a brand new smocked dress that is our daughters had also been dried and looks to be like it's shrunk, and I said, this wasn't supposed to be tumble dried either.Husband said \"sorry\" and left, then later he came back in and he just yelled \"sorry I fucxed up by drying things I shouldnt have, it's not like I've been doing housework all day and you haven't even said thanks\"He doesn't usually yell and is pretty even tempered, but I got annoyed too: I've told him that not everything can be tumble dried and he knows, which is why he asked me about the second load (but obviously not the first). It's ruined clothing of mine before. I yelled back and said I should be able to tell him a thing without him getting so hurt about it.But as I said, he doesn't usually get angry so I'm wondering AITA, perhaps I could have phrased it better \"I appreciate you doing all the washing but just for future reference these things shouldnt have been put in the dryer\"",

Lindy has become much more withdrawn over the past year-and-a-half, and she throws a fit every time we drag her out to some public gathering.This year, I got burned out by my sister's behavior, and I simply did not attend her 30th birthday party. It was an intimate celebration, and only my parents and I were invited. I just didn't show up. Shortly after her celebration, she personally came to visit me at my apartment, and she was depressed because I didn't come.

	"title" : "AITA for \"sleeping in\"?",
	"body" : "We have 2 small kids, 6 and 2 years old. I have a full time job and my wife has mostly been a homemaker since the 6 yo was born. For medical reasons, we have opted not to send the 2 yo to daycare, so at this point my wife is not receiving any mat leave and I am supporting the family on my salary.Despite this, I try to contribute what I can to the household. I admit I still do less than 50% of the total work around the house, but I’m genuinely interested in helping when I can. For example, and this is the topic of this post, we take turns getting the kids in the morning when they wake up too early.Also important is that my wife is what I call “nap-racist”. She gives me stink-eye whenever I try to take a nap. She was simply never a napper, always complaining that napping makes her feel groggy. Also, she’s much more anxious than I am, always putting upkeep of the house and children ahead of her own self care. My wife honestly doesn’t understand the concept of “self care,” and so is constantly nearing burnout trying to do everything for everybody but herself. Often I wonder if she sees me putting myself first (for ex: by resting) as selfish or lazy, even if it doesn’t inconvenience anyone. If my wife ever wants to nap, I’m always super supportive.Which brings us to the debate. When the 2 yo was a baby and would be up at 5am screaming hysterically and refusing to return to sleep, what to do was brutal but pretty straightforward— pick up the kid, take them far away from the other kid, and let the partner rest.Nowadays, they wake up a few times a night, usually needing a cuddle. When I go to get them, the whole procedure takes at most 2 min and they go back to trying to sleep. When my wife goes, the kid supposedly really wants her and freaks out when she leaves them, so it “takes longer”. I don’t really know why it should “take longer”, but I suspect if she tries to put them down quickly, they lose it because they know my wife will give in. Our morning family routine starts at 7:15. If the toddler is up at 6:30 and it’s my turn to get them, I go to put them back. Over half the time they lie there until 7 am. My wife thinks this is completely unfair, if the kid is up at 6:30 she just starts her day. She says that if SHE tries to put the baby back they’ll scream and she wouldn’t be able to rest anyway. But what I do on my mornings is ruining my wife’s sleep-in because the child calls for us later anyway.I genuinely don’t see her point. Wouldn’t it be better for both of us to be as rested as possible (especially if napping during the daytime is bad)? But she felt super passionate about it, even raising her voice this morning about how unfair this was (while the kid is trying to chill in their bed, mind you). I don’t know what to say. I think this is just her nap-racism sneaking in. This is why I wanted a third party’s opinion.So, AITA for trying to sneak in another 30-45 minutes of sleep when everyone’s still resting in the morning?",

Don't get me wrong, I'm happy she's able to live her life to the fullest but I can't help but feel like I'm no longer needed.

	"body" : "I (18M) am a college freshman and I know a girl. We’ve never interacted before, but we’re from the same place and have a mutual friend, who’s her best friend. She goes to a different college and she doesn’t know.We talked a bit during Freshers’ Week, but I wanted to make new friends. Still, I was nice to her and invited her to join us for lunch when she hadn’t made any friends. Everyone else at the table was talking and vibing, but she was quiet and had a hard time catching up with our humor. We felt slightly uncomfortable because of that, so we continued making plans without her.Then, we went home for a long weekend. Our campus is in a semi-rural setting with few transport links and the nearest airport is 3 hrs away, so groups of 3-4 people club together to rent a car and drive. I was traveling with another one of my new friends and she asked if she could come with us.During that ride, my friend and I realized she was too uptight for us to hang out with and very different from her outgoing best friend. We thought if we told her that, then she’ll get the hint that we don’t want to hang out with her. She nodded and we talked about other things, which I admit wasn’t that bad. She even mentioned she‘s on anxiety meds, but I didn’t think anything of it.We didn’t really talk for the next few days, until I got a call from her because she was being “harassed” by a guy in my frat and didn’t know anyone else who could help. She said he had been calling her multiple times a day, guilt tripped her when she was ignoring him and told her they were going to meet other people when he had arranged for a date. My frat friend said she led him on and overreacted when he made his move. Anyway, I told my friends about it and somehow the incident was the talk of the campus for like a week.After that, I saw her blankly staring at me in class sometimes, which I admit creeped me out. Later, I was talking to a girl in her dorm building and when I mentioned the place I’m from, she asked if I knew someone from there and said her name. I said I’d rather talk to any other girl than her, that there’s nothing between us beyond a mutual friend and that she’s crazy and creepy.All of this happened before the holidays. After we returned to campus, she called and said she needed to talk to me about something “important”. The way she said it, I thought it was about homework. She confronted me because the dorm building girl told her what I’d said.She said that she was daydreaming when I thought she was looking at me and clarified that she wasn’t into me. She did say she really wanted to be my friend, but I let her down many times. Finally, she said “I’m not mad at you for thinking I’m crazy or creepy, but telling random people about it is kind of a dick move on your part.

I have a history of crying at odd times. For example, while making thanksgiving dinner, I viciously started crying while preparing the turkey, I was made fun of for months, even to the day of posting.Spoilers for those who haven't seen it, Victini has this old king as his friend, and he has to save his kingdom so he has to move the castle and needed Victini's help, but after he successfully moved the castle he died, and Victini cried. ( This was the start of the downfall), Victini who now now has trust issues, because died, he now has a recurring nightmare that he's sitting on the top of the castle and his friends ghost (because he's dead) comes to Victini and told him \"I'm sorry I trapped you here\" because the castle has these pillars, that really don't do much except trap Victini, and then we later wake from the nightmare and see this random guy we know nothing about, start using magic to lift the castle, who then also brings the pillars closer, Victini has to fly to the castle to figure out what is happening, where he gets manipulated because of the random man being almost like Victini's dead friend. This random man then proceeded to attack Victini and hurt him with the magic of the absorption pillars which weren't seen untill now that suck his energy away.I only made it that far before the sadness had taken over, I was absolutely mortified from this movie and now my close family is making fun of me and telling me to get over it and even my mom is telling me to grow up.Am I the asshole?",

I sat on the other end, trying to get a nap in since I had been running on 3-4 hours of sleep, and I was responsible for coordinating the airport in the morning.About 1am, I don't want to interrupt them, but I really have to pee, and every time the couch moves it feels like a grinder against my bone marrow.I go to the bathroom and then move to the floor, which is how I usually deal with overstimulation.My partner got up to check on me, and I assured them, loud enough for their girlfriend to hear, or so I thought, that everything was fine and I was just overstimulated and was going to sit on the floor.I asked if it would be less distracting from their cuddling if I moved to the other side of the coffee table, and I settled on doing that.I did end up falling asleep, but things seemed tense when I woke up.I offered to go back to the hotel alone, but was told not to.I explained to her what had happened, and I thought everything was sorted out.My partner and I have to leave to go to the hotel and pack for the morning, and I have to comfort my partner, as apparently it was stressful during the time I wasn't listening. (While I was asleep and while they went outside several times because she smokes)Apparently she didn't answer texts until we got home the next evening, and it was one or two words.Last night I texted her the pictures I had taken of them, and my partner told her I had, since she wasn't opening my messages.A few minutes later she texted \"lol cute thanks\" which I thought sounded sarcastic given the mood the last 24 hours, and I tell my partner this.My partner rolled their eyes, said, \"Take it however you want\" and slammed the bathroom door.Apparently after that they talked on the phone and had a fight, but all I could hear was my partner explaining why I had come on the trip.

My parents are taking my sister and her family to Hawaii next week and one of the presents my 4 year old niece received was a swim suit. She insisted on wearing it the whole day. My problem was that she was calling it a “b@bing suit” (as in the term  b@be which couples call each other). What was really creeping me out was how my older male relatives and their friends would encourage her to say it over and over again. I’m not sure I want to make any direct accusations but it was really creepy to hear “hey Sammy, what you wearing” over and over and then laughter with their response.I was already at odds with my sister so I approached my mom and said how much it was bothering me. My mom said that it’s no big deal and Sam was just has trouble pronouncing “bathing.” I said I had to say something, she said that my sister is so stressed out to please not get “on a soapbox today.”Finally I couldn’t help it so I approached my sister with my concerns and she asked if I was really going to make a stink over this. I said is she really ok with older relatives making her toddler into a near sexual object at worst and an object of derision at best. She through gritted teeth “don’t you dare fucking say another word about this, I’ve had it with you.”The next time I heard Samantha say “b@bing suit” I sort of pulled her aside and told her how important it is to use proper language because even at her age men may be looking for things that she’s not aware of. My sister took Samantha’s and gave me the dirtiest look and said that it was time to change into the Christmas pajamas she got. After about five minutes my sister texted me “you are literally fucking crazy. I told you to stop.”That started the text was that had lasted almost 24 hours.

Pretty early on in our relationship, he told me that he had 2 daughters with his ex-wife who are now 15 and 22, and were 11 and 18 when I met them. While he was telling me about them he mentioned that after he and his ex-wife split up, his older daughter Chelsea (Not her real name) blamed him and still does. I didn’t think much of it at the time and didn’t end up meeting either of them until a year later.The first time I met Chelsea was during a 4th of July party with my husband, both his daughters, his ex-wife and her husband and various friends. By that point I had already met my younger step daughter a few times and she and I actually hit it off pretty well. However Chelsea seemed upset and kept her distance from me the whole party, and when I tried to introduce myself or even talk to her she gave me very short answers, before going into the house (it was at her mother’s house) for the rest of the night.That is essentially how our entire relationship has been. I’ve known her for 4 years and in that time I don’t think I’ve had one friendly conversation with her, nor have I seen her have a nice conversation with my husband. Every time that my husband or I try to reach out to her to try to spend time or even talk to her, she’ll blow us off or directly tell us she doesn’t want to see us, and she has never spent any individual time with us. By which I mean she’s only around in group settings like parties and family events, etc and even then she’s very cold and distant towards both of us.When my husband and I got engaged, I called both Chelsea and her sister to tell them, and all Chelsea said was congratulations and then not to expect to see her at the wedding before hanging up. She ended up not attending the wedding at all.The straw that broke the camel’s back, however, was a few days ago when she walked by while I was on facetime with my husband’s younger daughter. I called her over and asked her about her graduation (she’s graduating from college this May). She once again blew me off and told me not to worry about it, and when I told her that my husband and I would be there she said she already knew who she was giving tickets to and that it wasn’t either of us.I snapped and told her she was being ridiculous and acting like a child and that her parents’ divorce was 14 years ago and she needs to get over it. She told me that she was over the divorce but that she’ll never get over her “father being a piece of shit” (her exact words). I was honestly speechless and she hung up the facetime before I could respond.My husband got a text from his ex-wife that night, telling him that if he wants to have a relationship with his younger daughter he needs to leave Chelsea alone and tell me to as well. My husband told me Chelsea has been this way towards him since she was 9, and we're not sure what to do and it would be helpful to get some outside perspective. AITA?",

I got in the car and explained for a little bit, I was really excited but she told me to talk for quietly and kept interrupting me.

I could still hear her cursing at me saying that she would “take those fucking headphones and break them” note that I paid for them.

I also am a very blunt person if someone asks my opinion or the truth I don't sugar coat. Any way back to the problem, today we were in class and she said that Haley (the mutual friend also a fake name) was talking bad about her. I already knew this since amber was always talking about someone and it wasn't the first time she has talked about Haley either. Anyway I told her I knew what Haley has said and amber kept pushing me to tell her. Amber is very sensitive to other people's opinions btw. After 5 minutes of telling me to tell her I did. \"Well she said that she never really like that you called our friends \" your boys\" nor \" that you trained them. You are also very sensitive and people can not tell you anything and when you're upset, you act very upset where we feel obligated to ask what's wrong, no matter what's happening to us\" and she did not like that answer. She started talking crap about Haley. I bit my cheek so I wouldn't say anything to upset her. She asked me why I seemed upset and I told her bluntly \"if I tell you we won't be friends and you won't like the answer\" she said she was just voicing her opinion and I agree but she was taking it to far for me. Anyway she kept bugging me saying I had to tell her repeatedly and she said one last thing that pissed me off. \"If you don't tell you won't be my friend anymore\" this sentence enraged me bc I hate when people try to gaslight or manipulate.

You say best friends before girlfriends right? Yet ironically you want ray (her boyfriend) to choose you over his friends. You want me to be honest? Yet you get upset by the truth? I didn't want to admit it bc I like our friendship but I agree with each of those statements. Sometimes I feel horrible and yet you show up sad and I feel obligated to ask what's wrong. You act like a hypocrite sometimes but I ignore it bc let's be honest I do too but I won't stand for your guilt trips. I've lost a lot of people bc I didn't let them use me if you want to leave fine I enjoyed our friendship a lot but if you decide to stay and accept the truth I'll be more glad bc I truly do care about you as a friend.

So the day before the auction was to happen I found someone to help rob out by paying the taxes so I went to pick him up mind you Rob is on drugs and he refused to come with me to save his place would not come with me at all. So I made the decision to sign over the property to my boss who in addition to gaining the property is going to pay art off for Rob . So now Rob is going to be homeless and loose his $350000 property but art is getting payed I feel I did everything I could to help rob keep his place but because he refused to help him self my boss Owns the place art is getting paid for his bond but Rob lost everything.

She is really mean towards other girls (who wear make-up or dress nicely - pick me vibes), she is constantly talking badly about mutual friends from our karate club, even accused my friend of following a girl after class (he is 28 and she was supposedly 13 - she then confessed she made that up) and what I really dont like about her, is that she slept with a married man even though she knew he is married and has kids. We dont have that much in common, as she only talks about karate (and how good she is) and her work (shamed me for being a student). Well she wanted to go out with me numerous times thorough my finals (2 months). I am really anxious about having fun when i am supposed to be studiing, so i turned her down ale told her maybe after i finish all my tests. Well, after maybe the 5th time i said no, she blocked me. I wasnt that sad, because as i said, i didnt like her that much. After 3 months she texted me (from a different account) if i was going to national championship and asked if i could give her a ride and i said no, she asked why and i just told her that i dont want to be friends anymore because of things above. Well, she didnt take it well and called me names. I blocked her after that. She didnt arrive to the championship. My coach asked why didnt i give her a ride and i told him we are no longer friends.

Jakes minion, Lilly and myself had a friend group. After some relationship issues with Lilly and another person, we let Jake into our friend group. Jake was always kind of rude to me in specific but I always figured it was friendly banter. He often made back handed comments about me being trans, and sometimes evened straight up said I wasn’t a guy. But once again I figured it was friendly banter. Up until Emily came along. Emily is a girl that both me and Jake liked. Me and Emily ended up being the ones to talk, and I don’t know what when wrong where, but one day Jake blocked me on Instagram out of the blue. That whole day he was standoffish and rude to me (more than usual). When I asked him what was wrong and if I did some thing, what I could do to fix it, he didn’t respond just looked at me weird. A couple of weeks later, he posted on his note and on his story that he hates me, that we will never be friends, and he then messaged me dropping me. His treatment only got worse over time, and over time I became incredibly depressed because of it. It got to the point where I felt as though I had to get staff involved and brought him into the counselors office so we could have a talk. This talk did nothing other than make his treatment worse, and over time has made me so depressed I’m no longer going to school and am having thoughts of hurting myself. Here’s the kicker him and Emily are best friends, while me and Emily and together. The other day I expressed to her how I was feeling and how Jake was treating me, and that I’m tired of his transphobia and bullying, and that I’m reporting him. she went off on me, told him and Jakes minion, and spread a lot of personal information of mine with them. In one night, they all dropped me, called me a horrible person, started a gc with Lilly and Lilly’s boyfriend specifically to talk shit about me, I know because Lilly sent me sc’s and Jakes Minion added me. Jake and Jakes minion is claiming I’m doing this because I’m jealous of Jake and Emily, and that I’m being petty. Emily called me a liar and said nothing I was saying was true and that she didn't trust me, and we have broken up. The feeling that I’m a bad person, that im overreacting, or that I’m doing something wrong is eating me alive. I’m not going back to school and I’m transferring online due to the increase of bullying I’m experiencing since the other night. Idk tho So AITA?Edit: I have been transferred to online completely, and I'm transferring schools next year hopefully. Things have calmed down, Emily and Jakes minion apologized, and I accepted their apology, I haven't forgiven them, but seeing as I'm never going to see these people again, I figured I might as well for the sake of my well being.",

In the past, when someone at work had a complaint about me they’d tell him instead of to my face. I understand fear of confrontation but I make sure everyone knows I’m very fine with receiving criticism! It caused a big issue between us and got in between the relationship to the point we took a mini break and he asserted his boundary of not wanting to hear them anymore.Fast forward to now. Recently I’ve been getting over an extreme health issue, almost got into a fatal car accident, was issued an illegal 3 days to vacate from my apartment managers, AND covered multiple shifts on my days off despite needing to be in the hospital. (Random info: I’d asked my manager for permission to grab my checks before work even if it makes me late and she gave me blanket approval and to stop asking her) This morning it snowed and I called the boss of my store to say I was still coming in but that I’d be late since I’m nervous driving in snow. She said it was fine and she understood. I drove me and bf to grab our checks before I had to ditch him to run to my store and the manager of his store yelled at me saying I can’t get my check because im late and I didn’t get permission. To make sure she had the proof, I texted my manager who obviously said yes. Hours pass and I end up leaving work half hour early to pick up my bf again so we can go make dinner and he starts to tell me how his GM was mad at me for lying. She’d asked him his opinion and wouldn’t take no for an answer so he ended up saying she wasn’t wrong but wasn’t correct. I asked him to stop trying to pick a fight with me and we could talk about it away from his coworkers but he kept badgering me about it to the point that I just stopped talking and walked away.I can ignore people complaining to him but he knows how it makes me feel horrible when he tells me about it and fully knew I’d get upset if he brought it up this time too. Now, he’s ignoring me, yelling at me for trying to help out when he wasn’t even doing his job, and won’t even look me in the eye.I genuinely can’t see if I’m missing any social cues or if I’m over reacting but I feel somewhat justified in being mad that I’m being called a liar when I gave all parties proof I was telling the truth…..what the heck am I supposed to do??",

	"body" : "For the record, I (f15), am almost definitely the asshole in this situation.Before we begin, a thing to note is that my mom has a newly diagnosed health issue that will not allow for me to take any sports in the spring. This I am very aware is something that I cannot do, but it means that (at my school at least) it is very, very hard for me to ever play a sport during high school, and I can't help but feel that I have missed out on an essential experience. I want to be active and play sports with friends and be on a school team, and so far it is looking like I will never get that experience.My parents (F&M50+) just moved me and my sister (also f15) from the city into a suburban environment so we could be in a better school district for high school. Previously, we attended a very very small, very non-conventional private K-8 that both me and my sister HATED. I more than her, I think, but neither of us liked the school. This meant that all of our extracurriculars had to be outside of the school because it didn't offer any inside of it (because of size+style of education, I guess? Considering how much we paid for it it was a really shitty deal).Originally I believed that it was simply a time thing; driving in the city was a NIGHTMARE and my mother (whom I love very much) consistently drove for sometimes over 2 hours in total get us to and from school. Other things on top of that? It would've been ridiculous.Now that we lived a ten/fifteen minute drive from our school, I thought it would be a great time to try and get into sports, dance, etc. I picked out where we could go for these things, looked at reviews, compared prices, looked at driving times, I even contacted a couple of these places personally. I sent dozens of links and statistics to my mom.And every time she said she would look into it, I would check back in on her and she simply hadn't done anything about it. I've asked her if she doesn't want me doing these things, and she has no problem with it. I just don't know why what I want to do isn't important enough for her to sit down and look into this with me? It has been multiple years of me asking to do sports/extracurriculars of some kind and multiple years of sending them links and enthusiastic chats about it.Even school-run extracurriculars are not something either of my parents really care(?) about me pursuing. I tried to do wrestling and cheer in the winter and I wanted to do lacrosse in the spring, but I need a doctors note for permission. So far, taking me to the doctor has also been much of the same.I am aware that none of these things are really my parents fault, but whenever I try to bring up how I feel about this, my dad says that it isn't fair for me to blame them for it. But I feel like there are plenty of ways that I could've played a sport or done something similar earlier if they would have sat down and looked at the countless information I sent them?

After it happened, I was isolating myself from all of my friends, including her, and she was very bothered by this. A, B, C and I are in a group chat together, and I stopped responding to it, as well as talking to any of my other friends.C grew upset and asked why I’d been more distant, to which I responded by explaining how much my experience had affected me. I’ve had clinical depression since I was 11 and my experience caused my mental health to spiral. She said that it’s unfair for me to take it out on her and if I was going to go ghost mode I should’ve let her know because it makes her feel like a bad friend. I said it was unrelated to her and she should know that, but she insisted I was a bad person for making her feel like that, so I called her selfish for trying to make it about her when it isn’t.A month passed and A, B and C made plans to have a sleepover at my house, but I had no idea. I told C I wouldn’t be down for tbag and she complained saying she told me about it and I just wasn’t bothered to respond. I said that I was busy but she said she’d been looking forward to having sleepover because “it’s the only time I can get away from my family” and I told her it was self-centred of her to try and make my issues about her, and it’s unfair of her to try and pin that on me. I also mentioned that I didn’t even know what was going on with her family and she pointed out that it was my own fault because I never asked how she’d been doing, nor did I check the group chat where she discussed them, & called me a bitch for only focusing on myself not caring about her. I tried explaining that I truly do care about and love her, but she didn’t want to hear any of it as I was making her feel like we weren’t friends. Over the next few weeks, A, B and C made several plans to hang out with me and have sleepovers at my house, but I was never told about the plans until 2 days before the dates, which led to me repeatedly cancelling on them.C and I finally made plans to have a sleepover on our own, but once I told her that I didn’t want it to be a sleepover she cancelled entirely and I was hurt by this, wondering why she’d rather spend no time with me at all than a few hours. She said it was because I didn’t put nearly as much effort into our friendship as she did (emphasised by me reducing the amount of time we planned to spend together) and that I shouldn’t be using my experience as an excuse because she’d been through the same thing several times and, quote, “I never treated my friends anywhere near as badly as you are.”A, B, C and I finally hung out last month and I’ve restored my friendship with C.

Lindsay and I have had a few disagreements in the past, but we were never actually mad about them. Sometimes she would hurt my feelings because of the way she would say things, or she would get annoyed because of the way I think. One instance was when my ex added her and I told her to add him back and she did, and then I did too. I have been over him for months and she knows that, but then got mad at me for adding him. He was texting her and never added me back and she was bragging saying things like “Omg he added me back oh he’s texting me now did he add you back yet?? He’s texting me againnn hahaha omg he didn’t add you back still that’s kind of embarrassing” and shit like that. This man hurt me a lot and she knows that and still proceeded to almost brag about it and laugh about it to me. I don’t care about him, more the way she was acting about it. We would also disagree about money because she has more and her family gives her money, and mine can’t afford to. Recently I noticed that Allison and Lindsay were hanging out without me, when all of us used to hang out. I asked Lindsay if she was mad at me and she said “no ofc not I’ve just been busy with sports” which I understand, but she was still hanging out with Alison regularly, and not inviting me. I said “oh okay I just thought you were annoyed with me” which she then tells me she HAS been annoyed with me because I get “defensive” about things with her. The closest I have ever been to defensive is asking her questions about something that she said. I ask her how I get defensive, because if I’m doing it so much to the point where it annoys her and she doesn’t want to hang out with me, I want to fix it so we can hang out again duh. She says “like right now, and that time you added your ex and got all mad when I told you not to.” (I was NOT mad, I calmly explained I was over him and she took that as me being mad) I tried to ask her for more examples of what I was doing to be defensive, and she refused to elaborate, just saying “you just overreact about things and get defensive.” All I wanted to know is what I did, and I kept asking her. She got mad and said I was twisting the entire story, and I didn’t reply because I’m just over it at this point. But she goes on to remove me on everything, take down EVERY single group picture I was in on her instagram, even telling people who knows what about her side of the story to the point where they unfollow me and remove me just because of what she said.

On my dad's side, they didn't provide any clear answers and seemed indifferent. Frustrated, I eventually gave up on finding the emotional support I desperately needed.Despite my efforts, I couldn't find the emotional support I longed for, leaving me feeling even more alone and unsupported.A year ago from now, my dad's girlfriend, Angela, got her own emotional support cat, which upset me because I had been asking for a cat for the past four years. When I confronted my dad and Angela about it, they denied the fact. As a result of this and other issues, I now live with my dad instead of my mom, which means I have to transfer to a new school. My dad claims he has been trying to enroll me, but my mom believes he is procrastinating. In the meantime, I spend my days alone in the house, finding solace in the company of the cat in my room. Although she sleeps most of the day, I always hope that she will come and snuggle with me while I watch TV, crochet, or play video games. At night, she stays in my room, just like when she was a baby, but sometimes she wakes me up by scratching at the carpet, wanting to be let out. So, I allow her to leave in the mornings when I hear her automatic food bowl dispense her breakfast, and when she starts scratching, I know she wants to be let out again.After my dad advised against locking my cat in my room, I suggested alternative solutions like installing a kitty door or setting up a litter box and bowls in my room, but he refused. Despite having multiple litter boxes throughout the house, I ignored his warning and continued to let my cat roam freely in my room. However, one morning Angela noticed a urine smell in my room, and she decided that the cat needed a new home. In reality, they kept her locked downstairs with Angela's mom and grandma taking care of her. I can hear the cat meowing at the doors to the stairs, indicating her discomfort from being down there, and she is only allowed to come upstairs when I'm not around. Is it fair for them to keep her away from me like this? Am I the one in the wrong?",

	"body" : "I 17F and 18M boyfriend have been dating for 3 years. My boyfriend planned to eat with his mom (amy) & brother. He invited me to tag along. Amy was totally fine with that. When we got into the car, Amy kept on insisting that she can take her and her other sons food to go, and let me and my boyfriend just be by ourselves. She kept bringing it up several different times throughout the time we were at the restaurant. It made me upset because I felt like I was being a burden for being there. I would start a conversation but Amy would ignore me and only have a conversation with her two sons. Therefore I got uncomfortable and I had my mom pick me up from the restaurant. I let the three of them know that my mom is here to pick me up. I told them all thank you and goodbye. Amy got super upset by this telling my boyfriend \"what is her problem\", \"she ruined the whole lunch\", \"shes such a bitch\", and \"shes so rude\".I am not the type of person who lets people talk negativity about me. Therefore I confronted  Amy when I saw her a few days later. The conversation started by me telling her. \"hi\" then I question on why she called me a bitch. Before I can let any other word out, she blew up and started waving her finger in front of my face. Amy got very aggravated, shakey, red and loud even though I was being as calm as possible. Amy was calling me the worst names and started telling me the worst things. Amy loudly stated that she loves her son, and that her son will never love me as much as he loves her. My mom stepped in and told me to walk away. I walked away across the street and that's when I saw Amy throw her hand back which hit my mother in the face. That is when I lost it. I started yelling across the street walking towards Amy. Amy rolled down her window, called me a \"crazy bitch\" and said \"I hope (my boyfriends name) leaves you\", and that's when I yelled back \"that's why your husband cheated on you\".Later that day, Amy started yelling and throwing things around the house because her my boyfriend was not defending her from the situation. Amy proceeded to tell my boyfriend that he can no longer be with me. Amy said if my boyfriend continues to be with me, he will lose all contact with his entire family and she's going to kick him out on the streets. For the next four days, Amy has been mentally and physically destroying my boyfriend with guilt tripping, manipulation and narcissism. Me and my boyfriend have been keeping our relationship very secretive from his parents which is somewhat tearing us apart. She constantly still brings up the issue weeks later, and threatening my boyfriend to go to the cell phone provider to check the call logs to see if him and I are still in contact. Am I the asshole for confronting his mother? I personally think that she got so upset because I did not let her walk all over me and she was not in control of the situation. This is the first time she genuinely got confronted by her actions from somebody close to her, and her family.",

My school gives prizes for the 3 students with the overall best grades osf the year, and my goal in the begging of the school year was to be one of them.Then, I decided to work really hard and study a lot. Also, I was a very good student to all my teachers, always participated in their classes, payed attention to it, asked them about my doubts, and talked to them about my goals in general.Behaving like this made me have not a lot of cool teen experiences in the year, anxiety, very few friends, that were all very nerdy, competitive, and had the same goal as me, and also a very nerdy and geeky bf.Well, on the exams, I always did my very best, but the surprise came when the grades were revealed. I often made a lot of silly mistakes. Then, I talked to the teachers about it, and because of me being a good student, they would 90% of the time help me out, and change my grade. This happened throughout the whole year. Every time I’d make a tiny comment about this situation, my friends and my bf would get very upset at me, so I decided to share less and less about this topic to them. They were kinda mad because they weren’t able to change their grades with their teachers.Around 3 weeks ago, the surprise came: I was the number 1 student with the best grade, between those other 500. Of course, I was delighted with the news, it was my dream.But, when I started to tell my closest friends and my bf, I made them really sad. In general, they were mad because of some reasons: they weren’t able to change their grades with their teachers, and the difference between our grades was very slightly, so it probably made a ruge diference the help of my teachers. Also, we all had the same goal, so they were upset they weren’t able to achieve it.The feeling of happiness suddenly became guilt and sadness. Since then, my relationship with my friends has changed drastically, and I started to think more about the situation.After having a better talk with some friends, I understood some of theirs points better: they felt that it was unfair because even though they study as much as me, they weren’t very good at convincing and explaining their point to the teachers, and the prize should be to the person with the best grades, not the one with the best convincing skill. All of them always tried to change their grade, but hardly ever they were able to achieve it.To hear that all my hard work is only seen as a “good convincing skill” from my dearest friends was heart crushing.Am I the ahole for asking my teachers to change my grades? Were the teachers the aholes for changing it? Help me pls.(English is not my first language)",

I'm not trans myself, but I do have a handful of trans acquaintances and I know that representation in media is important. As a cis white man, I'm tired of reading and writing about people who are exactly like me. So I did a lot of research for this story. I browsed trans subreddits, read writing by trans people, and even joined a discord server meant for trans people and allies.This discord server, like a lot of discord servers, has a #vent channel, where people write about things that are bothering them. Understandably, a lot of people in this server write about experiences with dysphoria, transphobic families, etc,Obviously, dysphoria is something that I have never had and I don't know what it feels like. My character experiences pretty bad dysphoria, though. So in writing those scenes, I took inspiration from the conversations in this venting channel. And (this is where I may be in the wrong) I had my character explain their dysphoric feelings to a friend using language that was inspired by one specific vent.I published a draft of the story on my blog, and posted the link in the discord server asking for feedback. This was probably my biggest mistake. Well, someone recognized the vent (it was only a couple days earlier) and people in the server started telling me I was an asshole, a plagiarist, profiting off of other people's struggles (I haven't made any money from this story), and eventually I got kicked off of the server.So, reddit, am I the asshole for using a stranger's public vent to inspire my writing?",

She has planned for her friendship group and me to take a trip up to a major city and stay in her parents condo and go out drinking/clubbing. (for context we are all about 19-22 so its the norm for people our age where we are). One of the main issues i am having with this is that there are 3 couples going + me.   So, Ashley and her bf and 2 other couples. I will essentially be 7th wheeling. Now i could maybe possibly get past this if i knew all 6 of them well, but i don't. Don't get me wrong they all seem like lovely people and i get along with them but were not close, so this point alone seems like a very uncomfortable situation for me.The second thing i'm not too keen on is the drinking and clubbing. I have recently decided to give up alcohol pretty much as a whole with exceptions here or there. For instance nye i went with my boyfriend to a firework show and then a fancy hotel and we drank together. We didn't get hammered, we got a nice amount of drunk and i was in a situation i felt comfortable. I do want to stress that i didn't give up alcohol because of addiction reasons i just am not that fond of it, i hate how vulnerable it makes me and hangovers just all in all it doesn't seem worth it to me to drink. I mentioned this to her and she mentioned that her intentions were to get \"white girl wasted\" which we have gone out clubbing together before and gotten super drunk like embarrassingly so, which i loved and i love doing things like that with her, occasionally. Also not in February when its fucking freezing outside and the girls are all talking about wearing mini dresses and heels. Again, i love dressing like that so also not judging just i don't really want to  in -5c weather.Thirdly, this is an expensive trip for one night going out. I am unemployed right now and am on a very tight budget and to be very frank i wouldn't want to waste the money that i barely have right now on something i don't think i will enjoy.so reddit, WIBTA if i cancel on my besties birthday celebrations?",

	"body" : "It was in 2016 when my ex (F26) lent me (F27) $2,000 cash for me to start my remote work. We were together for 7 years at that time.I loved content writing and writing in general. Back in 2016 when remote work was frowned upon, I pitched my idea to my ex. It wasn't even a salesy kind of pitch, just a \"It would be nice if I could get started working remotely so I can leave my corporate job\" wishful thinking.My ex, who had just completed her 24 weeks police academy training had privileges. She could take out loans for mortgage, car, or cash from the moment she completed her training, and any banking institution wouldn't ask for a lot of info from her since she works for the government now.I had told her that I would save up on a laptop to be able to pursue my passion. I worked at an international bank, I handled back-office mortgage kind of thing, I had a stable income, but I was bad at managing my finances. I was young, stupid, and broke. I told her I was going to wait on a couple of months to buy a gaming laptop that would be ideal not just for writing gigs but also video and photo editing as I enjoy doing those as well as a hobby.Out of the blue, she wanted me to come with her to the police HQ of our town. Turns out, she had taken out a loan without consulting me first. We were partners, so anything she had planned in mind, she should've told me first that way we can think things through. I'm the type of person who wants to think about the pros & cons' of certain things before coming into a decision.This wasn't the first time she did this (making her own decision & not telling me). When she first applied to the police academy, I hadn't known anything about it. I only knew when she was about to leave 3 days prior because she has been accepted. That should've been a red flag but I ignored it.Of course, I let that slide as I didn't want her to crush her dreams only because I was butt-hurt for not being told of her plans for her future.When the loan was released, she handed the white envelop to me with $2000 in it. I was confused and asked her what this was about. (NGL it seemed like she was paying me off for something, otherwise it looked like a drug deal going on) She told me that it was \"for me\" to use to start my remote work. I asked her roughly the entire day if she was sure that she was giving it to me. She told me that it was indeed mine. And that I can always pay for it whenever I can. No obligation to pay her monthly or weekly, just \"whenever I can\". We had no paperwork to sign that stated that cause, but looking back now, there should've been.Fast forward to 2020, she'd be bugging me to pay off the money I owed her. I genuinely cannot pay her at the time because where I lived (Abu Dhabi, UAE), the wage I get was barely enough to make ends meet. I only found out through a common friend that the reason she needed money was because she was getting married to the guy she cheated on me.AITA for not paying the money she lent me?",

I kept the secret for a while until my SO started trying to plan around this coworker’s cross-country move so they could still be best friends. To ensure my SO didn’t waste time and resources, I broke confidence.I might be the ass because I broke  confidence.I(31/f) started a new job in September.I started dating a team lead at the sister company. As his SO, I tried to befriend his closest friends, his /m), and the other team lead(30/f).I've become close with the female team lead.His supervisor has been difficult. I ended up advocating for the supervisor after some conversations. Although we didn't care for each other, this bridged the gap.Fast forward, during a conversation with said supervisor, he says  “he is not friends with anyone at work, they were all just work buddies, not friends, and that he attends the occasional gathering to maintain the facade of friendship.” It also came to light that Supervisor hasn't forgiven my SO for a past transgression, and he dislikes my SO.I kept the supervisor's secrets, knowing he was moving across the country. Let it \"fizz out.\"My SO, convinced they were brothers, tried to plan around this move. The situation was delicate, but I eventually shared it with my SO, who was trying to keep this man in his life.My SO thought he could patch things up because the supervisor is such a 'great guy'. So I organized a small gathering for the three of them since both the supervisor and other Team Lead are moving across the country, hoping to send them off on a positive note.The supervisor and I disagreed about attending the farewell gathering. While he stated that he had the right to refuse, I told him he faked the friendship and to fake the friendship one last time. In the end, we \"agreed to disagree.\" I told the two team leads that the Supervisor wasn't attending the event as he only attends a few to maintain the facade of friendship. These were his words. Both team leads were visibly hurt. Various work issues hit the fan, and we had to split to fix them. The tension was palpable.We ended the day on a good note, and the supervisor offered to drive my SO home to apologize because he realized he was wrong. I thought all was well.Despite the promotion I got him, being conditioned on our close working relationship, he is treating me like crap now.Edit for clarity: I am the most high-ranking individual in this situation.My SO pursued me. My goal was to befriend his friends, word count had me edit with poor word choice.We are not in the same company. They are all in a sister company. Yes, I am dating someone below me in the chain of command. however, we don't work for the same company nor are we in the same department.Yes, we are technically coworkers, in that the same individual owns both companies, and sometimes our paths cross since we work in the same building.",

I got my license on my 16th birthday last spring but my twin didn't pass the exam, so I have been driving the two of us to school since the start of this school year. One of us driving is the only option for us to get to school. This year I've had some health problems where my head feels tingly and weird to the point where most days I can't concentrate well, and while I could still drive, I didn't want to drive feeling like this for the entire school year. We all came to the agreement that I would drive us to school and back for a month, and if my twin didn't get her license and/or didn't practice to try to make sure that she'd pass the next test in that time frame I would start to want something to make it fair.Fast forward to the end of the month, there have been no driving test appointments available so my twin hasn't gotten her license. She has also not driven at all, even though there have been multiple opportunities for her to (i.e. driving the three of us when we go places together, driving me to work instead of our mom), and has refused to drive whenever our mom asks her to. 1-3 months later I start medication and my head finally starts to feel normal again, so I'm not as worried about driving anymore, but I'm still a bit annoyed that I'm doing it.About 2 weeks ago we were finally able to get an appointment and she got her license. We went back to school last Wednesday, and even though my mother, I, and even my sister (though begrudgingly) agreed that it'd be fair if I drive us to school and my sister drives us back home, when it comes time for her to drive, she refuses and I have to. She drove us home once, and that has been the only time she's driven since she got her license. I have no idea how to ask her to drive us, because every time I bring up that she should drive, she starts an argument and we both end up angry. When I asked her to drive she refused, and then the next day when I tried just telling her that it was her turn to drive she got angry and yelled at me because I was being rude by just stating it and not asking her/giving her a choice not to. My mom told me the day before, when my sister was in the room, that if I gave her an out even just by asking her to drive instead of telling her to she will take it, and my sister didn't say anything then.I want the time in the car to spend doing homework, as this year we have a tremendously big workload. I also work while she does not, so I have less time to complete it than she does anyway. She's technically supposed to be helping me navigate and look for cars I could miss, but she spends the ride on her phone. I feel like I'm basically being a taxi service, and when I bring up that I don't think this is fair and I would like something to make it equal, my sister and my mom both refuse even though they both agreed to it before, and don't offer alternatives to my suggested idea of my sister paying me.

I do not charge Joe any extra $ for utilities (water, energy, trash, internet).Joe has a girl who he frequently hangs out with, but has made it clear that he has no interest in actually dating her, or being in any form of serious partnership with her. She seems nice enough. I noticed recently that she will sometimes be in his room in the mornings when I wake up (I can hear a female voice), but she wasn’t there when we went to sleep.

After his second covid shot he told me he was going to smoke some to feel better because his reaction to the 2nd shot was pretty severe. I didn't think much of it until it started to be a regular thing and from meeting his friends they talked about what a big pot head he has always been. This surprised me because he never presented it to me that way before that first time. I am from the south where weed is illegal and highly criminalized.He is from the north where it's basically everywhere and only recently legalized where we live. My main problem is that his parents are smoke every day, stay high all day weed smokers. They went with us on a cruise and they were hiding weed in their bags and at first didn't want to go because they didn't think they would be able to smoke. This rules their lives and to me looks like an addiction for them. They are extremely good to me and welcomed me with arms wide open. I call his mom, mom - like I love the shit out of them. They are not bad people, nor are any people who smoke weed, however after seeing this behavior from them repeatedly over the years and my boyfriends uptick in smoking it has me concerned. I expressed to him that I'm not comfortable having weed in my house or my car. I don't want to smell like smoke and I don't enjoy him doing it because he gets so stoned he has literally left me at a wedding where I didn't know anyone for 3 hours. He has failed to be able to function for reservations we had for dinner, etc.Ultimately, I don't want him to become like his parents because the really bad i stances are few and far between, but the fact that they happen infuriates me. While he has initially agreed with me that it's not a great habit,  he still sneaks around to smoke weed. I primarily catch him smoking late hours in the house because of the smell.I come from a family riddled with addiction problems, which he is aware of. My dad has a pill problem, my grandmother and uncle have drinking problems and others. I have purposely distanced myself from overindulgence for fear of turning on an addictive gene I know runs in my family. Although him smoking doesn't directly affect me it is definitely a history button for me and my upbringing. Am I an asshole for asking him to stop smoking and being very disappointed when hes high?

	"body" : "I(22) have just finished university in sports coaching and I meet some friends there who I live with in a house just outside London. I pay rent but that is from my job at our local club not with my parents money. This is how I found out the club was for sale, I love this club ans it was why I got into sports so I went home and told my friends and we decided to buy it. This was until the owner told us the price as we offered 30k between the 8 of us, he wanted 55k. So I said to my friends that my parents gave me 20k for a house this year and I told them I didn’t need it and they wouldn’t take it back so I would use that, the other guys got 5k together and we bought it. This was a few weeks ago and it just got announced then when my parents asked how we had that much money as we had all just left uni, I explained that I used the money and they started shouting at me and claiming that If they knew I would waste it they would of given it to my sister who is 29. Anyway I told them I offered it back and they said that they thought I would just use it later which I wouldn’t have done. Now they are asking me to pay them back and I can’t as I haven’t got a new job yet as I left the other one as I would have just been paying myself.Notes: my friends have degrees in business, physiotherapy, architecture, engineering and law. Also my parents had 20k because they won 100k and wanted to keep 60k and give the other 40 to me and my sister.",

	"body" : "So my friend (16M) who has been my bestfriend since we were 12 asked me (16F) to hangout and I’m wondering if it will make me an asshole since he has a girlfriend. His girlfriend and I are friends and she’s never said anything around the topic of us hanging out, and she has made it clear she is very comfortable with my bestfriend and i’s friendship.When he asked me to hangout he didn’t state that it would be one-on-one but he implied it as he didn’t mention anyone else in it. I’m not sure whether he has asked her or not but I am asking this here just to make sure in case she gets mad about it. He made a suggestion of seeing a movie, and since he has a girlfriend I don’t know if it would seem too ‘date-ish’.His girlfriend knows there has never been any romance between us and our relationship has always been platonic, and theyve been dating for about a month. I do definitely want to hang with him but i’m wondering if one-on-one is too much?edit: the reason i’m asking this mostly is because in my school, girls get blamed for EVERYTHING, so if she gets mad about it, who gets blamed?? Me. Eg. once i got really drunk at a party and a guy who another girl who i didnt even know had a crush on kissed me - who’s fault?? obviously mine !! My female bestfriends boyfriend starts liking me and tries to cheat on her with me and even though I reject him, still my fault duh! I have a conversation with a guy i’ve known since I was eight at a party who has a girlfriend - THE NEXT DAY, there are cheating rumours. - like i can’t do anything with a guy without getting my head chopped off by the public ",

He arranges everything, including living accomodation and finding a job and unlike many others offers a path to PR and citizenship. However it requires trust on both sides as once you obtain a PR you could work for a different job than the one he provides if you wanted but the agent requires that I work at least a certain number of years.I have seen other immigrants struggle and have to live in crowded flats and I am very grateful for this agent as I live in a great 1 bedroom flat by myself  and while I have a low wage in Canada for my job, the agent has someone gift me the difference in India so I make the equivalent of 100K CAD after tax.Unfortunatelty I already told him I used an agent when I had left and despite me telling him that the agent said not to disclose who he is, my friend is persisting.

He’s a big man, 6’8 almost 300 pounds and very very hairy long beard long hair tattoos, dude looks like a Viking. He is the most gentle giant and he adores my little girl just as much.

	"title" : "AITA for not eating?",
	"body" : "Hi all, my wife (25f) and I(24nb) have been together for 4 years. We are totally happy together, and love another very much but this one issue is driving a wedge between us and I need some perspective.Since I was a kid, I’ve had struggles with food. I wouldn’t say I have an eating disorder, but I certainly struggle. When I have weed it’s much easier to eat, but I certainly rely on it more than what’s healthy for my appetite. The other factor to consider is that I have autism, which comes with PDA (persistent demand avoidance, an aversion to doing something someone tells you to do just because they’ve told you to do it) and food sensitivities regarding taste, texture, etc. all this to say that while I’m not the pickiest eater in the world, I am very specific and forcing food down my throat when I’m just not hungry is like torture. It’s like chewing paper, and it’s really frustrating and just in general puts me in a bad mood.My wife has been trying to support my eating needs since the beginning. Encouraging me to eat, finding the food I crave for the sake of a meal, casually suggesting she grab me a snack instead of telling me I need to eat. She’s really been a star, and I’m grateful for her.Here’s where we come to the issue. I work third shift, I ate four taquitos before work at 10:30pm last night. I drink coffee all night, and I had chips at around 5am before getting off work at 7. When I got home, she was already sleeping and tbh I wasn’t stuffed or anything but I just wasn’t hungry and we don’t have anything I’m interested in eating. She asked if I was going to eat before bed, and I told her that I just wanted to go to sleep. She brought up that all she’s seen me eat is those four taquitos, and I told her that I had chips at 5am. That wasn’t a meal, she said, which is true, but then she got frustrated and said she was tired of always arguing with me and begging me to eat. At this point, I just got up and made myself some ramen to appease her, but now she’s furious and she says she’s done talking with me about it. She’s giving up trying to force me to eat. Thing is, I never wanted that from her. I just want to hang out and eat when I want to eat, even if that means I end up not feeling super well until I do. That’s the consequence of it.I understand her irritation, and I understand that it’s taxing on her to feel the weight of my choices, but from my perspective quite frankly I don’t understand why this is the thing that made her snap. I out wanted to come home and go to sleep. I want trying to purposefully starve myself or hurt myself—which I do have a tendency to do, but I’m usually pretty honest about myself with that and ask for help if I need it. But I don’t need it. I was just tired.Idk, if someone could help me and provide a different perspective, that would pile be helpful because right now I just feel like a huge AH and I don’t know how to help.",

She wants me to open the bathroom window whilst I am showering to not let the bathroom get damp and mouldy despite us having an extractor fan. I refuse as we live in an a flat and the window opens to the communal stairs and if opened neighbours would be able to see me showering which would be embarrassing.

I then propositioned that I can open the window after I shower so then people wont see me naked, she still denied that option, I said there is no way I am opening the shower window like that and she got angry saying that I don't pay the bills and I am making it harder on her by doing this.

	"body" : "Some backstoryMy father [48 M] left me [21F], my mom [48], and my brother [16] 3 years ago after he cheated. It wasn't pretty, because even though he stayed in the same city (though on the other end of it) we've seen each other maybe once every week or two. Our family took a big hit during that time, cause 3 days after he left, my mom's father died, and our dad didn't stay long to support us (he stayed for the funeral and two days after, but then he left, though my mother begged him on her knees to stay).The next year was extremely stressful because my mother was constantly trying to hold us together while helping my grandma and keeping us in our house. I tried to help, but I was finishing high school and was studying hard for my finals to go to college.TBF my father kept sending us money, around 1200 dollars which helped a lot. But then he got together with the woman he cheated with, and the money stopped flowing so freely. I suspect because she tries to keep him away from us and direct his attention towards her two kids (which she's been successful at)I didn't care about this much, because I've never needed much, but my mother needed this money to help us survive and let us stay in our family home. So, fearing that he would stop paying, she signed a contract with him in front of a notary that made sure that he would be paying those 1200 dollars and pay for half of our school and medical expenses.Tbf she didn't have to, because in my country child support is mandatory until 26 years old if the kid is still studying (that includes college, which I go to), but my father's money (which he has a LOT) are mostly under the table so she wanted some insurance, that he would pay that exact amount.Back to todayMy father haven't pay his share for my third year in college (I covered it) and pays around 494 dollars monthly (which is for both me and my brother), saying that he won't pay more because it will go to my mom and her new husband.But... I started living alone a few months ago, so it doesn't make any sense and my mom never used that money on herself to begin with. He also says that he feels like an ATM (which he has been saying since I was little) but I don't ask him for anything more than child support which was determined on his terms!My mom and her husband (who's kinda rich, but has two kids my age so he can't give too much to us, which my mom doesn't even want to) pay me around 543 for the flat and living expenses, but it's still not enough to live.This month he didn't pay at all! I'm meeting with him to discover why, but Reddit... Am I the asshole to expect him to pay? I don't ask him for anything, tbh I'm too afraid to do so. I know that every time I do so, he will spit it in my face sometime later, or will subtract the value of it from my child support even though he says it's a gift.

He tells me l'm dramatic and he didn't do anything wrong. He goes \"God for bid you pick up the slack for a week\". \"You do it an act like it's the end of the world\". He's getting very defensive.So two questions finally:Is it to much for me to ask him to A. Help feed my dog and B. Keep the door shut?Because Iv been doing so good at keeping up with the house chores (for how quickly he's heal I would think the end of next week we should start talking about it again). When is my stopping point to expect him to pick it back up again? But I feel like nothing is going to get done…..there's going to be our son's laundry everywhere again and dishes only done once the sinks.I realized he just isn't upholding his chores. How do I discuss this with him without getting so defensive?",

	"body" : "I (M30s) and my partner (F30s) very recently lost one of our sweet kitties suddenly. A few days prior, my grandma on my dad’s side died followed shortly by our cat. Since this time, I’ve had very little contact with my mom and two younger brothers (both in their mid 20s). I had to ask via text my family to send a message to my partner and my mom said, to paraphrase, ‘I’m sad he died, he slept with me at your house’. My partner responded but that’s where the conversation ended. I have a group text with my mom and brothers (parents are divorced; some ill will towards my dad) in which I informed them my cat died and I was sad about it. No one called, there were maybe 4 overall messages, two from the middle brother and one or two from my mom. In all the chats, group, brothers only, and individual chats, I am ‘left on read’ as the kids say. My mom almost never calls me…I went to look and she called me at almost 10pm my birthday—for context we live in the U.K. and she lives in the US.There is, as always, more context: My partner and I went to visit for Christmas and to celebrate our engagement in 2021 and we had to wait until 930pm to open gifts and celebrate because my brother was with his partner’s family and I think also because my other brothers girlfriend was working (she chooses to work every Christmas for overtime…which was likely spent on drugs or fast food as they live at my moms not on essentials because they need extra income). So I’m still salty about that which informs this:I’m tired of being treated as if I’m not important, and as if my partner isn’t a valued member of the family. So I’m choosing to stop trying with them. I’m no longer being the one to call my mom, she can call me. If my brothers want to hear from me, they can reach out. And I don’t want any of them to come to our wedding because they don’t seem to value my partner and it’s also, and most importantly, her wedding.Am I the Asshole here? Should I reach out to them anyway and nudge them, because I have to do this, towards making plans for our wedding? Or am I justified in being tired of doing the heavy lifting of this relationship?",

	"body" : "I (20sF) live with my mother (Mom), brother, and stepfather (Gus) (not real names)- though to say my stepfather lives with us is an exaggeration lately. Mom and Gus have been together for 14ish years. I've lived with them for the last 4.Gus works at a big store. 2 years ago the company asked him if he would be willing to take a position out of state. He took the job, which is about 3 hours drive away, and the idea was he'd come home every other weekend. He and Mom figured the increase in pay would be worth it.At first, everything went as planned. But he started coming home less and less. What was supposed to be a 6 month assignment has been going on 2+ years.He says all the time that he's coming home this weekend, only to go completely incommunicado for hours, even days at a time, and not show up. Eventually he'll say that he fell asleep, or that he wasn't feeling well. We gave him the benefit of the doubt the first dozen or so times, but now it's just what he does. He hasn't been home in months.My mother has had a lot of health issues lately, on top of her preexisting disability. A month ago she had a medical procedure that Gus was supposed to be here for-- but he wasn't. Thankfully I'd guessed this would happen and didn't go to work that day, so I could be at the hospital and take care of mom after. He didn't even check in til after the it was done. It broke my heart sitting in the hospital listening to her say \"how could he do this to me?\" I'm now the one who my mom has to confide in. Mom and I make household decisions together. I make sure Mom has eaten (she often forgets or she is too dizzy to safely get to the kitchen) and has what she needs. My mom spends so much of her time and spoons figuring out our finances.He continues to be awful about the most basic communication to myself and my mom. Once, he was supposedly on his way, and my mom didn't want to eat lunch because he usually takes her out when he comes home. He'd been out of contact for hours, so I convinced her to eat with me. Sure enough, he was a no-show. She tried to hide it, but I know it made her sad My mom deserves so much better than this.Anyway, I want nothing to do with him now, and I tell my mom this. I scoff whenever she says that he's coming home for the weekend, because he doesn't show up. Mom is angry at him of course and says she gets how I feel, but also gets annoyed with me for badmouthing him because he does still pay bills and support us, reminding me that if he does show up I have to be polite. Also, to be fair, as I am currently student teaching, I'm not contributing as much to the household as I was, and without Gus' money I'm sure I'd have missed a car payment or 2 by now. But I don't think money makes up for his complete lack of presence.So AITA for wanting nothing to do with him and not being shy about that?",

Additionally, my FIL has been living with us for over a year.From the beginning, our Shar Pei has displayed concerning behavior towards my FIL. He consistently barks and attempts to grab at his ankles while he walks by. This persistent aggression became even more alarming when our Shar Pei attacked our chihuahua in the past, resulting in her bleeding.

Upon our return, my FIL informed me that the Shar Pei had bitten through his leg.

She said I should send her the design I wanted so she can buy it but unfortunately due to my thesis and work load in uni, I was VERY busy. And one day my small bag gave up on me and made me realize, I didn't need a big bag, I need a small one. Obv she agreed since it would be cheaper but I begged her that if cash that shed give be hundred or a thousand higher than what she always give me. She told me to what kind of small bag I wanted, and I did with very distinct features of thick straps, horizontal bag, with pockets. And I sent her pictures as a sample like she asked to.Note, I wasn't asking for anything expensive or designer. I just want what I need, horizontal bag (for easier view and access to what I need to get), thick straps, and pockets (cause who wouldn't love pockets).Then christmas came, I know where she bought the bag and I was fine with it cause I had an eye for a particular bag that has what I wanted, but when I opened it... it was horizontal like a tote, with one pocket but that shop only has bags with thick straps so it was the onlt good thing it had. And I'm not the one to sugarcoat my words or fake the expression of my face. Obv it showed that I was disappointed. But I did say thank you.

In my country you can't start learning how to drive until you are 16. I am currently learning how to drive and can't legally drive her places. She is mad at me and keeps telling me to \"hurry up\" so I can drive her to Starbucks and take her shopping.While that does bother me, it's not why I yelled at her. 3 days ago, I was sick of sleeping in our messy room. Her stuff is all over the floor and whenever I try to tidy she yells at me and says that \"you need to leave. I don't want you in here because I'm busy and you are taking up too much space.\" Keep in mind that the room we share is quite small (approximately) 2.8m (9.6ft) by 3.2m (10.5ft). It has 2 beds, a desk, and cupboard. So there isn't much space.I was cleaning underneath and onto of my bed. As I was cleaning I was putting her stuff on her bed (she likes to put clothes and other things on my bed so she doesn't have to put it away), when she said \"that's it. I'm sick of you throwing everything on my bed and pressuring me to clean. I don't feel comfortable with a clean freak in my room. And I hate you taking up all the space. It's my room too\"Here is where I might be TA, I yelled at her and said that \"I shouldn't have to live with this. It's my room too.  You can't yell at me for just existing in my own room. You are so lazy and don't a roof over your head. You should learn to exist out side of our room and I wish you would just move out already.\" I then picked up the rubbish bin and dumped it all over her bed.I then left and have been sleeping in the living room for the past 3 days.I do realise now that I over reacted and shouldn't have said and done the things I did. I just felt so frustrated and didn't feel like I was getting the help I needed from her.I have since apologised but she won't accept it. I'm not surprised.So AITA?Edit: here's some more info, my parents are on vacation and won't be back for 4 days.

She can be a very manipulative person and her family enablers her by giving her whatever she wants. She also  uses her bubbly personality as a tactic to gain peoples trust and mistreat them. her immediate family are incredible people who do nothing but give and are supportive are good people they always seem to just accept her behavior. Me on the other hand I was raised in a very poor and appreciate what u have kinda of family. She takes advantage of them and she takes full advantge of there kindness. All of this has really took a tole on our friendship  Recently she got out a marriage after finding out her husband of 3 years was cheating on her. I totally support her leaving her husband as he was a very toxic man who was very emotionally and mentally abusing towards her. If I'm being totally honest I never liked her ex husband as I felt he was very controlling but she stayed with him for years in hopes of \"keeping the family together\". We talked and it sounded like she was on the right track and was going to focus on herself in a healthy way finally after 10 +years of her Sieral dating. I thought I was going to get my bestfriend back. that's not what ending up happening the following day after she broke up with her husband. She ran into a old bf (who dated for maybe a few months when she was in active addiction ) this guy And he also cheated on her. And here's the kicker this guy who cheated on her before she met her husband was on tinder. He sent me a \"Hey Cutie\" Immediately i recognized him from pictures she showed me and showed her the message. She was upset broke up with him. Now this guy she met shortly before she met her husband. Came back into her life about 3 weeks ago. And they're now engaged! I confronted her about it. asked why she would ever go back to someone who cheated on her in the past  she said \"I don't care about the past\"! she said I don't care \"he's changed\". And I told her that was really sad that she didn't care about being disrespected like that. And that  felt like she was self sabatoging and she said I was the issue.",

She thought it was worth a ridiculous amount as I had mentioned the prices of 2008 shelf companies that come with all of the necessary documentation needed.I thought it’d be great to buy hers so I applied a bit of pressure in terms of the process because time was of the essence. I suggested a price and we both carried on with conversation laughing about how she thought it was worth way more. I needed one with licensing bank account VAT number etc. Hers was just an aged corp with back taxes. I asked her if I could start the process, she agreed. I had sent a website that indicated shelf companies prices.A day later I call her cause I had already received the necessary information on the company status. I told her I had asked people for a favour to keep it in operation and I’d pay the back taxes name change etc. And because we laughed about the price in the previous call I needed to confirm before I started payments. She said she thought she was getting the price of the older company so I explained to her that it would not make sense for me to pay the equivalent of $2000 for it.She said she’s not selling it to me anymore. She felt cheated and said she’d rather let it go or use it for something else and as I had already engaged the process with her permission and I was checking in to be sure we’re on the same page. She had sounded unsure so I double checked.I had asked in our messages what she thought was a fair price. She ignored it. She asked for the details of the people I engaged so that she could do the process alone. I told her I was willing to pay more simply we had already checked it’s status etc. She then forgot that she had given me permission to do so and said I had given her personal details to strangers. She asked what amount I would’ve been willing to pay and I gave her an amount. She got excited (she’s been going through it so I was being patient with her).Her and I agreed to the price and circling back this year.  I was given a company this year as somewhat of a gift .

My mom will talk about Mittens to our other 2 cats, 1 of which was Mittens' littermate.Mittens weighed 18 pounds at her heaviest. Her littermate, sister about her size weighs 9 pounds. The vet had told us to get interactive feeders and diet kibble for Mittens, and we did, but my mother would pour the kibble out of the feeders so she was still just eating and eating, and she always got her daily wet food in addition. I personally believe what ultimately got her was a bowel obstruction, as she always had problems with hairballs and vomiting up kibble, often multiple times a day.Last week, my mom was talking about Mittens while my dad and I were in the room, she was technically talking to our other cat.

I was very much wrong. It started at my second to last shift. I started my period mid shift and lost so much blood that I started getting dizzy and actually almost passed out. I went to the back to do some dishes and calm myself down but apparently that was the wrong thing to do. I waited for a minute for the sink to fill up and the shiftlead who was sitting back there starts yelling at me and saying I need to step up and stop being so useless.

But I'm fairly sure it is a boy, and I withdrew from the conversation as to avoid making a scene as I was fairly upset.Would it be wrong of me to chat with my sister and ask her if she has any other names she would consider for a boy?Should i wait until the gender reveal?I know it hard to lay claim to a name when you don't even have a baby, but it doesn't stop me from feeling hurt.This also isn't me saying she isn't a part of my mom's side of the family, or that I don't view her as just my sister. We all love eachother as if we were all full blood related. I just am torn between being happy for her and upset since I've always intended to use that name.I want honest feedback from strangers rather than close friends or family as they might be slightly skewed toward my side.Edit: I guess I'm using this platform as a way for me to work through my thoughts. It's not that I necessarily care that she uses the name. It's more that I don't want her to make me feel I can't use the name in the future.Whose to say I won't change my mind in the future and use it as a middle name bc my partner also wants to honor a family member, etc.I really just want anonymous perspective and conversation with strangers as I would rather not feel the need to chat with my mom (her \"step\" mom) as my mom tends to be slightly protective of me. My sister has a right to the name as he was her grandfather as well, granted not as close, but even if she just likes the name she's more than welcome to honor him.",

The non-binary friend is biologically female, but started using They/Them pronouns in college. I will call them Alex. I will call their partner Cameron (He/They). [Note that my fiancé and I are both black. Alex and their partner are white.]My fiancé and Alex were close in middle school/ high school. They were both sporty. I was a theatre kid. Alex was popular and would have parties at their house after school. I was never invited to hang out with Alex and the \"cooler\" kids, but my fiancé was. Alex and I knew of each other, but never conversed outside of school. Even though my fiancé and I went to different colleges, we actually became closer and started to date in college. Once my fiancé and I started dating, I got closer with Alex.I find Alex and their partner incredibly annoying, privileged and whinny. I consider myself Liberal, but after a conversation with them, I feel like a raging conservative. Alex and their partner both grew up upper-middle class and my fiancé and I did not. Both my fiancé and I were on scholarship to attend the middle and high school with Alex.Both Alex and their partner are unemployed. I wanted to pull my hair out listening to them talk about how hard it is to find a job now and a wide range of government conspiracies. If I am being honest, hearing two white people complain about not finding jobs made my blood boil. I served tables all through college and law school. They had their tuition paid for by their parents and didn't work through college. I believe if they REALLY wanted jobs today, they could have one. They just don't apply for jobs they feel are below them. Alex's parents bought the house that Cameron and Alex are currently living in. They don't pay rent. I think they are lazy. My fiancé and I are both attorneys, we are both employed and we are both paying our way through life.My fiancé is more in contact with them than I am, but since he proposed, I expressed to him how annoying I think they are. I even went as far as to say I don't want them at our wedding. My fiancé doesn't think they did anything wrong to not be invited to our wedding, and noted we've known Alex since middle school. I brought up the fact that they would be around our families. Sometimes both of our families can be... well.... ignorant. Alex and their partner will definitely cause some conversations based on appearance alone (piercings, tattoos, hairstyle etc). It might not be a safe space for them. Alex and their partner have also made many comments \"joking\" about Christianity and often put down my religion in front of me. They know it rubs me the wrong way, but I always ignore it. I don't expect them to agree with my religion, but some comments have been disrespectful.My partner agreed to not invite them to the wedding. My fiancé broke the news to them, but didn't give a reason why. This made Alex extremely hurt. AITA?",

I told her about my identity before we began living together, though I did not come out \"publicly\" at our university until this year (changing my name/pronouns in the system.) I am not really comfortable being outwardly queer due to discrimination where I grew up, so I try my best to stay as lowkey as possible about my gender identity.However, my roommate has had a bad habit in the past of outing me to people without my permission. We've had several conversations in the past where I've asked her to stop, that I'm not comfortable with her sharing personal information about me to no avail. She acts as if I'm being overdramatic, or that I should be totally okay with it since I'm \"out\" in regards to the current classes I'm taking. Once I told her that she'll never really understand my identity (since she isn't LGBT herself), and for the last year since she brings up that she was \"hurt\" by that comment, even though I still stand by it as truth.The major incident that has led to this post occurred at the end of this semester when, once again without my permission, my roommate told a former acquaintance of mine about my gender identity. I know this person because I was previously involved with a religious group on campus they are also a part of. Naturally, this group is not supportive of the LGBT community, so after I decided to cut ties with that organization, I chose to also cut ties with any \"friends\" I had there, which has been fine, the biggest inconvenience being to myself as they are often active around campus and it can be a challenge to avoid them. So, my roommate outed me to this person, and I only found out a couple days later when that person replied to something I posted on social media using my name in the message.I was surprised, because I hadn't spoken to them in a year and due to various personal reasons, am not out on social media, so there was no way for them to have known. I sent a screenshot to a groupchat with my roommate and my partner (who is also friends with my roommate) expressing my confusion, and my roommate responded by being defensive, telling me not to get mad at her for outing me and she told them to keep the information private.I have been in another state for winter break and have been reevaluating our friendship overall due to several other issues we've had the last few years. Multiple people have advised her to give me space, but she has texted me a few times pressuring me into forgiving her, also saying that if I wasn't going to work to \"fix this\" I should just tell her that I hate her. Honestly after all of the chances she's ruined, this was kind of a \"last straw\" for me and I don't feel that I owe her forgiveness. So: AITA if I don't forgive her for outing me?",

After getting my license, I mentioned to my sister (15) that if she would like me to drive her places that are out of the way then she will pay me a dollar for every kilometre out of the way. After doing the math on my most recent fuel up, realistically each kilometre would only cost 13 cents in fuel but I have also specified that she is paying for my time as well. At first she was reluctant but understood that fuel was expensive, but after talking with our father she no longer believes that it is fair that she has to pay so much. Tonight, we had a small fight about this payment after she requested I take her to coles for snacks. I have plans early in the morning and would’ve been happy to take her if she was paying me the $1/km however she put up this fight. Keeping in mind that this trip would also be me waiting in the car for ten minutes while she got the food so most of the money would’ve also been going towards that. AITA or should I lower my prices?EDIT: Many people have been asking about who’s paying and other cost related things. I am currently paying off the car, paying for fuel, and will be paying for any repairs and general maintenance when they come up. It would cost more for my sister to get Ubers places and I don’t believe she has the money for it. The most common place she asks to go is Macdonald’s (which would cost less to just get delivery) or her mates place which is a half hour drive just to get out there. The only time she has to pay is if I’m not her only option, if our dad is with us or has forced me to take her, or if it’s an emergency that she doesn’t want dad to know about.",

Everyone seemed to have moved on.Husband and I now have 3 kids. My middle son (6) is in the same grade as Millie’s son. They are in different classes and I only found out about this after my MIL passively mentioned it.The moms in my son’s class created a groupchat. A couple days ago Millie contacted me and asked if I could add her into this groupchat and said that she and her son are having trouble connecting with the other moms/kids and it would be a huge help. I was a bit confused as to why she was asking me for permission, and how she got my number but I quickly realized that the other moms probably told her and out of consideration for me wanted her to ask me? I’m not sure. Most of these women grew up with Millie so they know “everything.”I told her that I can’t really stop anyone if they wanted to add her but I’d rather she not join. Besides, it’s a class groupchat and her son isn’t in it.She got upset and asked if I’m only saying no because of her history with my husband. I said well yeah. She then said I’m being sensitive and petty. I told her that I’m uncomfortable. She said not everything is about me and I’m being selfish. I made a sarcastic comment about protecting my peace before firmly telling her she won’t change my mind and that neither she or her son are my responsibility. Millie got even angrier and said that I’m the only person still hung up over their relationship and that I need to grow up and stop being so insecure. She also accused me of being elitist?She’s still at it and will tell anyone that’ll listen about how I’m being selfish and how I’m so hung up over the past. My husband thinks we’re all being ridiculous. He was joking when he said that but idk. One of the moms in the groupchat privately asked me about the whole thing and she just said “hmm” so I really don’t know, but they said they weren’t going to add her unless I “gave my permission.” AITA?Edit:I understand that I’m the asshole. I do feel a little crazy but I can’t deny that I’m not uncomfortable no matter all the “you do realize he married you” comments.

So the day come, and I was up early waiting on ticket master website, and to my surprise, I got in, so I thought, I might as well just buy 2, and go with her, so I ended up buying 2 seat at the far end of the stadium, at the price of 180 each. And then I think, it was only 180 each, and her birthday is coming up in a few month, might as well just gift it to her as a birthday gift, so I told her such, she was very excited, and gave me the best BJ I ever had when she came back to Canada.Well, the issue comes when I started dating my current gf (lets call her PonPon) (who is also a fan of Taylor Swift), when I started seeing her, I decided that it would be weird to still go to Taylor's concert with my EX, so I just asked my EX if she know someone who want to go with her, and she said one of her friend really wanted to go but was not able to get a ticket, so I just told her she can have my ticket. I did not tell her about the ticket since I already gave it away and not have it anymore. Everything was fine until we meet up with our friend for New Year, and one of my friends just casually asked that \"now I am dating PonPon, what do I do with the Taylor Swift ticket?\" PonPon instantly asked me \"you have Taylor Swift ticket?\" I just said \"oh yeah, but it was for my ex and I, and when I started dating you, I just gave mine to her friend, because you know, it would be weird to still go when I am in a relationship with you.\" well, she did not take it well, and ask \"you could just aske her to give her ticket back, and we can go together\", I just said \" I am not taking back a birthday gift\". at this point, she was visibly annoyed and just said \"Then ask her to give your ticket back\", So I asked her \"do you want to sit next to my Ex?\" at this point she just blew up at me, saying I care more about my Ex, that she is my current gf so she should have the ticket, so I just told her \"I didn't even know you back when I gifted her ticket, so I am not asking for the ticket back, and that is final.\" Well, now she is telling me the relationship is not gonna work if I prioritize my ex over her, and want to break up, but I don't think I am prioritizing my ex over her since the whole thing was before I even met my gf, so AITA?",

She brags about all this money that is spent on her by her family and is constantly talking about what boy to date next. Her sister's and my daughter-in-law have politely asked her to stop talking about these things, but she won't stop. She also tries to dress provocatively. My husband and I have discussed things with her before to make it clear that she needs to stop this behavior.

Her mom and I aren't on the best terms, so asking her for help with the matter is not an option.The other day, she was telling my daughter-in-law that I am bat s*** crazy and I have no right to remove her phone from her possession at any time.

If it was one person, I would understand, but she is venting to everyone about everybody. Her sisters, my daughter-in-law, my sons, and I are all sick of the drama. We know that having a lot of girls in the house, six teenage girls, will automatically have more drama, but whenever this one step daughter is gone, things are way more peaceful.Almost everybody in the house would be happy if she would just stay at her mom's, and her father has already given her that option.

His wife’s family is extremely poor and have never been able to help financially. We cover quite a bit since there’s no help from one side. She also has multiple siblings and whatever is left in her parents estate is being split among them all. It will likely be very little.My older son’s wife’s family is of equal (if not more) wealth to us and provide for their daughter without hesitation. As such we have not given them much help since it was never needed. This DIL is not only an only child but the single member of her family in that generation. She is set to inherit from a half dozen estates as the last living relative. They also do not plan on having children.Our wills, written before either was married, were originally equal splits. With how things have gone we feel we should leave the majority to our younger. They will get next to nothing from his wife’s family and have children of their own to support. My older son will inherit more than enough from his wife’s side to equal out.We were talking about this with some friends and they said to be prepared to cause tension by treating our sons differently. My spouse and I believe our reasoning is sound, we love both but one needs more support from us. Are we correct or are we being assholes?",

I mostly work from home in an IT role.Today I saw that our energy usage was nearly £14 by 8pm. I asked my wife to use energy more consciously, and to be considerate of things like multiple tumble dryer loads rather than just the immediate needs and to hang the rest, not to treat every red light as a race track green light when it appears, etc.Her response has, in short, somewhat taken me by surprise. She has suggested that:If we are short of money, she will return the shirts she brought me today.That asking her to consider hanging washing rather than tumbling it is to utilise time she does not have.That I had used energy being at home, having a shower, and using my laptop all day. At her insistence no less as my plan had been to go into the office today before she asked me not to.Her parting shot before going to bed was that “top job, I haven’t even had a shower today” .. when no less than 3 hours precious I had asked whilst cooking dinner if she was in the shower or not, and she said she’d rather have one tomorrow.I’m a bit at a loss to be honest.Am I the asshole?!?EDIT: I have actually been knock-dead surprised by the number of YTA. This has lead to a bit of a self-review, and, while some of the NTA’s were nice, and maybe right as well, the overwhelming response was IATA…I’ve sat down with my wife, apologised profusely, we’ve had an adult conversation about it all, and are going to jointly make some changes to reduce energy use. Not because we can’t afford it but because I’d rather use it to pay for fun things for my daughter and us as a family than just give it to an energy company where we could do something sensibly different.Thank you for all your responses and insights.

We still do get along well just aren't as close as before. She had a rough break-up last spring and has struggled with some pretty deep depression ever since. Even though I love her and feel awful to see her struggle, she’s become very draining and overly sensitive since.Our family recently learned our mother’s (65F) cancer has returned after 5 years remission. While there are still a lot of unknowns at this point, we do know that she's in for a huge battle ahead with a lot of intense treatments.I wanted to do something extra special before she starts treatment. I decided to plan a family vacation to Hawaii. I invited both my parents to join my family (me, my husband and our 5 & 6 year old daughters). My sister doesn't have kids and my daughters are my parents only grandchildren.  We offered to pay for my parents expenses but they refused.My husband and I own our own business and have flexibility in our work schedules. We arranged everything on short notice, carefully working around my mother's medical appointment schedule.My sister works in healthcare and started a new job 3 months ago. A few weeks prior she had been complaining that she would barely have any time off in the new role and had a very busy schedule.I didn't invite my sister on the vacation because I assumed she would not be able to take time off from her new job as she had mentioned recently. I really wanted to make sure this was really a happy, special trip for all of us. I was afraid that if she was able to join, she may drag down the mood even if she was not intending to do so. She hasn't been able to come out of this dark depression and I didn't want our mother to feel like she was stuck trying to cheer her up the whole time.My sister found out from our father about the trip. She blew up at me and is now refusing to speak to me. She made the accusation that she is “always left out” of family events. Says she has felt this way for some time and feels like our family excludes her intentionally. Because she lives in a different state, she does miss more family events & holidays but it was her decision to move away so far. I wonder if she's feeling more sensitive about abandoned given the recent break-up also.Its been a few weeks since we returned from vacation but my sister is still refusing to return my calls or texts. She is also really upset at both our parents. This has caused a lot of tension on top of an already stressful period dealing with our mother’s cancer diagnosis and her upcoming treatment.I'm not sure what she wants or needs to make things better. I would love to include her in more things but it's usually not possible when she lives so far away from the rest of us. Was I wrong not to invite her along on the vacation? Is it also my responsibility to make sure she doesn't feel “left out” of family events?",

My mum also has amazing skin like no wrinkles and shes in her 50’s, so I wanted to make a joke that since I have melanin Im not going to get wrinkles too.

The cats are always sick and the house never gets cleaned, she only empties the litter pans once a week and NEVER scoops. Daughter doesn't have any income so, never helps with cat supplies such as litter, food, medicine, etc. I'm cool with the outdoor cats and, if all the cats wanted to live outside, I would be ok with that too. I would never make him choose me over his daughter but I really want to tell him it's me or the cats. I don't want to live in an rv the rest of my life and before all you \"pets are family too\" people come after me for wanting to re-home the cats, CPS would be in your home if you allowed 7 children to live like these cats do. So, would I be the asshole if I told him it's me or the cats?",

	"body" : "I (18F) have a group of \"friends\" from college, I say \"friends\" because not everybody's close. One of my friend's (soon to be 28F) birthdays is approaching and she's invited us (16F, 17F, 18F, 22F, 25F) out for a meal and drinks.Here's where I have a problem:The plan is that we go out to a restaurant for drinks and maybe grab something to eat on the way. This would take place in the city since we all live pretty far. The older girls (27 & 25) want the underage ones to be able to drink. The plan would be either the legal girls order drinks for them or they sneak vodka into the restaurant. The legal age for drinking where am from is 18.I feel uncomfortable about this. There's no point in pretending that people underage don't drink however the two girls who are underage have never drank. The 17 year-old is my best friend and she's been wanting to drink for a while now however her birthdays quite a while away. The 16 year-old is autistic and has problems with anxiety. The plan isn't to just \"drink\" I don't have a problem with that, they want to get drunk (not my words, the words of the the girls aged 16,17,25,28). Then afterwords we would all take the train back alone to our places since we live far. I personally don't plan on drinking much, I don't want to get drunk and probably won't stay out long but both the underage girls want to. I can't help but feel like it's unsafe, the 16 year-old has never taken a train herself and is vulnerable due to her being autistic. I don't believe her mother is aware of what's happening. My best friend has anxiety and I honestly don't know if she's ever taken the train alone before (not something we've really discussed I've only known her since last year). The city we are going to isn't the nicest, I'm originally from the city and even I don't think it's safe, the crime rate is up dramatically lately and even people from the city are avoiding going out as much as possible. I didn't think my friend (27) would do something like this, I honestly think a lot less of her because of it. It's well known in the group that the 16 year-old is very naive and vulnerable and that my best friend has anxiety so them taking the train home drunk just seems like a recipe for disaster. The only thing I can think of doing is to maybe report it to the college or their  parents but I just know my relationship with my friends would be over but I want them to be safe.So WIBTA and am I just being dramatic?Also just for reference the train is 50 minutes for me, 45 for the 16 year-old and 1 hour for my best friend. We don't live close, I'm 50 minutes away from my best friend by bus and there's no train.",

AITH in this scenario?We watched the college football championship last night. I brought snacks and made some too. He made some food, too. It was really fun at first. I was having a great timeAround halftime I noticed it said both teams hadn't won a Championships since the 90s, but I thought Michigan was considered the best team of all time. I also went there for grad school so I was like maybe I have a biased perception. I looked up some stats, and I saw Michigan really doesn't have very many bowl titles. I am an analytical person so I was trying to understand what that meant, esp because I hear people say M is so much better than OSU and MSU but they had won big deal titles more recently than M.So we talked about that for a min and it was fine, he was really engaged in the conversation. Then I was just joking and I was like broo Michigan suckssss how come everyone convinced me they were so much better than MSU and OSU? So immediately the guy isn't playing around back and he's like look at other bowl titles. And I was like I did, they are not that great!! I grew up in Boston so I am used to people dogging on me about the Pats. I thought it was all in good fun to give a little shit, esp because neither of us watches a lot of football and Michigan was obviously going to win the game anyway.He really got defensive which took me aback because I thought we were being silly.  Again I went to Michigan, not him. He started saying I was ruining a Big Occasion for him and he loved Michigan since he was a kid and I was completely out of line to disrespect the winningest team in history. So I backed off and was like, yeah, \"I just meant its funny I assumed all these things. Anyway, how does a team win so many games but not win the big titles? Does it have to do with their strengths and stuff?\" And he got defensive again and started giving an explanation like, thats just how it is and I was like, no I'm really curious how does a football program with that many wins not make it to Championships or win bowl games if they're able to win season games so much? And got pretty mad and started waving his arms around for emphasis and was like, you just asked the same question over and over (I asked twice) and if you don't want to listen to me when I explain it to you, then why do I even bother talking.  You're so rude and you never listen. On and on while I just sat there, stunned.What's funny is he didn't mention that the two teasing comments I made are what pissed him off. He just kept making it about what a terrible listener I was. I was surprised because when I show him movies or shows I like, he talks about how much they suck, so I didn't think that kind of teasing would upset him so much.

	"title" : "AITA for suggesting to my dad that we “forget” my mom’s birthday?",
	"body" : "Disclaimer: I believe that people are free to follow whatever religion they want, but in situations like my mom it’s definitely a concern for her mental health. This is relevant. .I (nb, 21) was at the store with my dad (m, 59) a couple weeks ago because I was wanting to get a toy for a cat my best friend just got. It was my mom’s birthday, and my dad suggested I help him pick out a cake for her. I don’t like my mom, for good reason, so I suggested the two of us just act like we forgot it was her birthday.My mom (f, 55) has never been that nice to me, my dad, my brother (m, 18), or my best friend, so I felt it to be fully justified, especially with how she often acts like she forgets his birthday as well.Both of my parents worship God, but she takes it to such an extreme that even my dad who I’d say is definitely a conservative Christian says she takes it too far, and whenever she treats us in ways that I’d say are likely manipulative emotional and mental abuse we can’t call her out on it or she will start yelling “Be quiet in the name of Jesus, you Jezebel spirit! I will not let you bring my spirit down!” because she believes that she’s one of the people that can’t do anything wrong and anyone who calls her out on anything wrong she does is just a demon lying to her.That bit is, sadly, only scratching the surface of how she is.Because my mom acts like that towards everyone around her, I felt as if acting like we forgot it was her birthday was fully justified, if a bit mild. My dad seems to have understood where I’m coming from, since he’s often compared her behavior to some situations his mom pulled on him and his siblings, but he still got her a small cake anyway.I don’t think I’m the asshole, my dad doesn’t either, and neither did my best friend after I told them because of a couple stunts my mom had pulled on them. I’m just wanting to know what people here think.So as to not risk people I know realizing who I am, I can’t go into much more specific of how my mom acts with how specific her actions tend to be at times.Edit: I thought I might have mentioned it, but I might have forgot. The reason why I was specifically suggesting we act like we forgot is because she’s done it to my dad every year, so I felt it might have been a bit of payback. I tend to be protective over my dad because he almost died from blood loss due to a medical issue he was having, and her true opinion of him showed with her only caring that he’s our family’s main income provider.Edit 2: Someone suggested that I try moving out as soon as I can. Unfortunately that’s far easier said than done. I’ve been trying to find a way out since I was 16, so 5 almost 6 years. I only just managed to get the learning permit for driving less than a month ago, and I have no form of steady income. My mom pulled me out of the school system after I finished Middle school, so I don’t have my Highschool diploma, and she likes to sabotage any chance I have of getting a job she thinks she has no control over because she’d rather I stay at home and basically be her live-in maid.I also saw someone else saying that me trying to bring my dad into it was too much. Less than a week before then she instigated a screaming match between the two of them just because he wanted to sleep a bit longer, so when he said he was wanting to get her a cake that was all I could think of, confused about why he’d get her something after that happened. He thought the suggestion was funny but also said “I’m just getting her a small one so I don’t have to deal with her nagging me for more money this week.” The money he’s talking about being the $100 a week he gives her that she’s SUPPOSED TO use on groceries and to get things we need around the house, but instead she uses it to get things that allow her to keep indulging in “hobbies” that make her mental state worse and worse.",

One of them is \"Ana\" (20F), who studied from 8th grade to graduation with me. We were friendly enough during school but not really close.Ana is awesome but has one little issue: her love life. She dated a girl during 9th grade and the 1st year of High School, and no one since then. I believe that the reason is because she can't stop third wheeling for her two best friends (both 21M).They are a couple and seem loyal enough to each other, so it's not even like she has a chance with one of them. They have an apartment together, they do absolutely everything together and I'm pretty sure they even bring her to their dates. She's practically their pet at this point.How is she supposed to find a man (or a woman) if she keeps following her roommates like a lost puppy? Even if she found someone they would be turned off because of how close she is with them.We were at a party before Christmas and a guy hit on her and she turned him down. I asked why she didn't give him a chance because he seemed like a pretty cool guy and she just said she wasn't interested and then joked that she already had two guys at home and didn't need another one.I guess I got mad because I feel like she's the one who gets the least action in her love life out of everyone in the friend group and she'll never change that if she keeps being like that with her best friends. So I told her that she should wake up to reality and stop being a third-wheel, she said I should drop it and I said that I was just worried about her because before she knew it she would have wasted her best years with zero romance.We argued for a bit and then she just said \"okay\" and went away. Since then, things have been a bit tense between us and our groupchat has kind of dried up. One of my friends agrees with me, but some others think I was out of line and that even if she has a weird relationship with her roommates it's none of my business.

H has a long time boyfriend that we can call B.So basically, H has always been a bigger girl. Since getting to be adults, I would say she is 60-80 lbs overweight, just for context. She is a pretty girl, very likeable, like I said my best friend. Weight is the last thing I ever notice about her.Except for the fact she brings it up. All. The.

B, her boyfriend, has expressed to me before privately that her weight doesn’t bother him, but her constant complaining about it does. She cried to him often about it. Now, H is active. She goes to the gym semi regularly and used to be very active in CrossFit. But she eats horribly. And I don’t mean to be rude but she really does, fast food for at least two meals a day, large portions, all that.So the other day, we are at the beach, and she points to our other friend, N (who is stick thin) and says “I wanna be like you how did you lose your weight?” Because N used to be heavier than she is. Not overweight but she had gotten skinnier. N admits that she lost a lot of weight very unhealthily and that she shouldn’t do what she did.So H points to me and asks what I do to stay in shape. I tell her that my job is 80% active, so it helps, but other than that I run and try to eat healthy. Which is true and she knows that. I said “H, if you are serious about losing weight, come run with me at my gym! I’ll also show you what I eat because I have a few low calorie meals that are actually pretty good. It’s 90% your diet if you want to lose weight and I can show you how to get a better one?”H lost her shit. Crying, offended, and hadn’t spoken to me in DAYS.

In August, she asked me if we could watch her friend’s cat for the semester. Part of me was skeptical, since we have a no pet policy, but my roommate reassured me it would be fine.I agreed since I’d been considering getting a cat of my own, but made sure to mention that watching a cat for that long could be detrimental to her mental health, since she could get attached to it, but she reassured me it wouldn’t.While the cat was here, I got annoyed with it always scratching on my furniture and I mentioned to my roommate that after this cat left I was done. She seemed to understand, so I thought nothing of it.The cat was supposed to leave on Dec 14. I had a family emergency, so I left with my dad after I graduated on Dec 10. I did not come home until Jan 3 and was surprised to find a new cat in my apartment. She hadn’t mentioned anything to me about it.When I called her out about it, she ignored me for days. I finally texted her and she said how she really needed the cat for her mental health and I called BS on her. I felt bad about it until she made a joke about how every ESA is just for show, to get around our no pet policy. We continued to go back and I asked her to keep it in her room and out of common spaces, since most of the furniture is mine and I’ve had to keep the cat from scratching at my things and ruining them, which she said was ridiculous and I was unreasonable. (I still tried to do it anyway.) I just graduated college and have a few more weeks until I start work so I cant afford to replace my already brand-new furniture.I then continued to remind her I didn’t want the cat and put all of the cat’s things that were in the common area (INCLUDING THE LITTERBOX MIGHT I ADD), and she kept moving it back and ignoring my attempts to talk about it. I’ve also tried talking to management, since the no pet policy is their thing, and my roommate couldn’t be bothered to send the ESA letter  (Which makes me skeptical if it’s legit)Now that brings us to today. I received a text from my roommate this morning asking me to take care for her cat for the next 2 days while she‘s home for the long weekend. I said no since it isn’t my cat. When I left my room to get breakfast, I caught the cat behind my TV as it was tipping over, thankfully.This was my last straw. After I got my TV back in place and was sure it wasn’t going to tip over, I texted her that I would be taking her cat to the humane society. AITA(For clarification: humane society is no-kill and you can get your pet back for 3 days. If they were going to kill the cat I wouldn’t do it it’s more to show my roommate that I’m not messing around. My dad is the one that mentioned this to me. He said I should do it because of the no pet policy in place and since management doesn’t seem to care.)UPDATE: Hello everyone! Thank you all for the input! The humane society called me today and asked me about why I was the one to bring the cat in. I told her everything and was confused since my roommate lied on her application and said that her address was different. When I asked if it was a super big thing as it is her mom’s address, they said that that was illegal and they would have had to consult the landlord before they can let the cat go into her care. I feel so bad for having to snitch, since now she’s in danger of not getting the cat back.",

	"body" : "My husband (25) and I (24) are staying at my moms place for the holidays. We're both autistic and have other disabilities so we struggle with a lot of tasks. I'm on disability for that reason and I have a caregiver and I'm in the process of getting a caregiving team to help with daily stuff like cleaning the apartment, shopping, doctor appointments etc. And my mom knows that. She still doesn't accept that I'm disabled but that's besides the point. My mom always cleans on Saturday and she went to work early in the morning. I woke up at around 8am and my husband at 10am and we just laid in bed and then ate in the kitchen and i did all the dishes bc my mom always screams at me if I dont do everyone dishes too so I didn't want to be screamed at. I didn't know it was Saturday bc I still thought it was Friday and when my mom came back around 2pm she came to me and asked if I vacuumed. I was confused and said \"did you ask me?\" Bc I wasn't sure if she asked me before and I forgot! But she started screaming at me saying that she worked her ass off at her gas station job for 6 hours and went shopping and I couldn't get my ass off to do one little thing without her having to ask and she left to go play at the casino afterwards. Now I feel like shit and want to cry bc I genuinely forgot and didn't know and she always wants me to do stuff that I didn't know she wanted me to do and when I do do it I don't do it good enough. I also have a 13 year old sister who doesn't do anything and my mom doesn't do the same to her. My sister isn't even awake yet. My mom always spoils her and doesn't treat her like she treats me and I'm always the one doing something wrong and when I explain why I can't do stuff she just says it's excuses and others can do it too. But now I feel like I should've known or done it and nor forget so am I the asshole?Edit to add : I added the part about my sister bc when I was her age she had the same expectations of me that she has today but she doesn't do the same to my sister. I had to do housework like cleaning the toilet, vacuuming, dishes and taking out the trash when I was even younger than my sister but my mom doesn't do the same with my sister at all and I find it unfair even when I ask my sister for help when I need it2 edit: I want sure if it was relevant to mention my other disabilities but someone said I'm burying the lede so I'm also schizophrenic and have POTS. That's why I have a caregiver and get a caregiving team bc I struggle with big and basic tasks and so does my husband (he has autism and severe OCD and major depressive disorder)",

	"body" : "So i (15m) am going to pass from 10th to 11th grade this winter break. Every year at my highschool they do this big mexican celebration (im in mexico) to clebrate our tradition and shiz, and everyone is mandated to participate in it. They give each grade a little post to sell food and drinks, and they give us a bunch of tickets so we can sell them and fund the party.My (20f) sister went to the same school i am in and put herself as my tutor, wich means shes basically the one the school sends the emails and calls about tuition and stuff like that, so since shes alredy been to about 3 of this partys she knows the gist of it and was supposed to help me sell the tickets, aswell as my (50m) father who  is the one who pays for the tuition. When i told him said \"yeah ill help you sell em\". A month passes and its a week before the party, and i had still not sold any tickets, and i forgot about them cause of exams and they where just collecting dust in my drawer.Thats when my father tells me \"hey you wanna go to seaworld with me n your stepmom?\" Wich to i say \"sure\", but i was on the day of the party, wich i didnt really mind not going to cause its seaworld. After i return, the party is over and i never hear from the tickets again. A week after that, i get told by the principal i need to pay some late fees on tuition n extra stuff (wich i presume where the tickets), i tell my dad and he pays with some troubles from the sales department at the highschool, but it gets resolved.Mind this is in late september, jump to a week ago at the end of the winter break when my sister comes to me saying \"hey, i just got a call from school saying you need to pay for the tickets you had to sell, how many did you sell?\" And i told her \"none, i didnt go to the party, plus, you n dad didnt really help me sell shit\" to wich she gets mad at me for \"not being responsible\" and i tell her \"tf was i supposed to do???\" To wich she responded \"you couldve sold them to your friends\" wich i did try, none of them wanted to get in extra dept. she tells me that we have to pay for the tickets, and i ask her how much is it, SHE SAYS 30 BUCKS PER TICKET. I found the old strip of tickets amd counted 16, wich means at a total it would cost us about 400-500 dollars.now my sister and mom are mad at me for this, and i dont even know if my father knows yet, and i cant sell them now that the party was done 4 months ago, i honestly dont think im the ah in this situation, cause this is the first of this partys i was in and my sister was supposed to help me out, she did nothing, and my father was supposed to help me sell the dang tickets, he also did nothing, i did my part to the best of my knoledge and they did not help at all, now my family is mad at me....so reddit. AITA?Update: i tough i might need to clear up somethings about my situation, so heres a quick notes:i really dont want to just place the blame somewhere else, i believe in consequences for actions, i also see how i have may come across as irresponsible, wich i kinda are, i have no real expirience with this stuffI really couldnt just \"take responsibility\" of selling the tickets, people at school didnt want more tickets, i dont know anyone outside school, and i couldnt sell them around cause i aint allowed to wander around in the streets, also i couldnt sell them online, thats why i needed the help from my family.When i say \"oh i forgot\" i mean that i was in the middle of exam season and had to study for ablut 12 differen exams and projects wich took all my attention at the momentUpdate 2: aight i think to clear up MORE things4. some people seem to think i just got the tickets and didnt even mention them to my parents, and now blame them, and sorry if i told it like that, english aint my first language and its my first time writing a aita story. I did tell my family about my tickets, for about 2 weeks straight, we got the tickets at the start of the semester, i talk to my family about it, then at the end lf the semester i entered exams and thats when i left the tickets in a drawer. i asked them about 7 times in 2-3 weeks before the exams came5. The tickets arent a house to house sale, they literally just give you a bunch of tickets n say \"sell em\"Update 3 and final: well i read alot of your comments and responded to a few, and the situation just got resolvedYES im a ass for not remembering my responsibility YES the school is a ass for giving students over 400 dollars worth of stuff YES my fam couldve help me more At the end of the day im mostly at fault, and i accept itI just talked to my father about the matter and he told me to not worry too much about it, he will pay the fee, and even apologized for not helping me sell the tickets, i also apologized for getting him into this mess, as for my sister i think shes still mad at me, but i think itll blow offThanks for the kinda reality check and for the supportAlso if any tiktokers see this: DO NOT POST THIS STORY, I DONT MEAN THIS AS CLOUT CHASING AT ALL, I TRULY FEAR THIS GETTING BACK TO MY KNOWN ONES OR EVEN THE SCHOOLThanks for reading ",

	"body" : "Hi. Help me settle this bit with my husband.Tonight my husband, 31, has called me selfish, f 27, for moving our kids ages 3 and 5 into the smaller bedroom. We have 3 bedrooms in a one story. The now kids room is 10 feet by 15 feet and comfortably sits their two twin beds, book shelf, dresser, and a small lounge chair with plenty of room to navigate in.The larger room is roughly 15 by 25 feet or 20 x 30 feet I can’t remember which of the two was on paper. It’s a massive room. For visualisation, it now has my work desk and computer, a double sized bed, a dresser, and a sectional couch, with plenty of room left to play in and navigate in. It’s a massive room.Before this evening, it was the guest bed (the double sized) and my desk, two chairs for the desk, and the lounger in the smaller room. It was extremely cramped and I felt really claustrophobic and stressed. Almost swarmed if that makes sense. I’m autistic and if the room is tight and doesn’t “feel” right I get overwhelmed and move things around to fix it.So, tonight, now my husband has stated he’s irritated with me because he believes I’m being selfish and putting myself first by putting the kids in the 10 x 15 foot room.My stance is, I work from home, two very high stress jobs, I feel like the bigger room is a better fit for me. The kids have toys in the bigger room now, along with their room and the living room (so basically lots of spots for toys and playing). I stated they sleep in their room and that’s it. There’s no need for them when they’re so little to have such a massive room. Also, not really that it matters but we’re only living here for about one more year and then we can move to a more levelled place- in regards to room sizing and space.So, aita and selfish?",

We have a big garage that our 4 outdoor cats stay in at night and in the winter.. the cats were gotten to keep rats away. We are having a cold spell where our nighttime lows are 15 degrees and daytime highs of mid 20s. The garage has a room that has a small space heater and blankets and place they can go if they need to get warm. At the start of the cold spell they just decided they were going to bring the cats into their room for the coldspell. We have a big German Shephard who freaks out if the cats are on the outside of the glass so what do you think he'll do when there's 4 cats on the other side of a bedroom door.. I didn't have the best instant reaction but then said fine whatever ill leave so you can bring them in until this cold spell is over which wasn't a good enough solution for them. To me the the cats have a garage they are locked in to keep them from the cold and a room with a heater.. the cats are checked on and fed.. if there is a cat that's in distress when you check on them sure then bring them in but if those cats are perfectly fine in the garage there's no need to bring the cats in the house with the dog right? Or should I really have been oh yah bring them in with this dog?",

Other than paying someone to pour concrete, we pretty much plan to do the work ourselves with the help of his very experienced father.My fiancé has a friend (who is currently living with us to save money, he pays $300 a month rent) looking for side jobs (cash work) and my fiancé wants to pay him under the table to do work for us during the process, just paying an extra set of hands.However, I don't feel comfortable hiring somebody to do side work on our property that doesn't have health insurance. There's going to be a lot of physical labor, big equipment, and tall ladders (which are more dangerous than people seem to think). I just worry that if something were to happen we could be on the hook for a lot of medical payments and damages.The friend/roommate has the opportunity to purchase insurance through his job, and chooses not to to save money. (Idk if relevant, but I get the hint that these things he does to \"save money\" are not to put money into savings, but to spend on other things like weed and cigarettes because there's no evidence he's saved anything and he's frequently stoned)We are unable to come to an agreement on this and I needed another perspective. AITA?Tl;dr: My fiancé wants to hire someone to do relatively dangerous work but he doesn't have health insurance so I don't want that to happen.

	"body" : "I (33F) was child free and wanted to stay that way for most of my life and all my friends are the same. My partner and I talked a lot about pros and cons of having kids and we both agreed I wouldn't abort if I ended up pregnant but we won't actively work on kids.However in the last year we wanted kids more and more. First we wanted to foster (adoption is nearly impossible in our country) but then we sorta ended up pregnant. I am due to give birth soon and my friends are being dicks about it. I told them off and called them cruel and they called me a selfish asshole.So, context, since I have been purposefully child free most of my life I am aware of the downsides of having kids. I personally think a lot of people are being unwise when they decide to have kids and less population is generally better but I never ever said it to someone's face especially when they were expecting. One cannot know what are peoples motives to have children or to not have children and I never judged. Whether you have offsprings or not is completely irrelevant to me to see you as a person. When I got pregnant I was delighted but scared, naturally. I am anxious person by nature and I always talked through my things with my friends who were always there for me. Until the topic centered around my pregnancy. For the past 7 months of pregnancy, every time I mentioned something bad relating to pregnancy (like having nausea, back pain, insomnia) my friends jokingly said \"well you got yourself into that shit, now suffer hahhaa\". First it was a joke but sometimes it gets really hard and considering we always whine about something (one of the friends the other day literally cried cuz she missed a beginning of a movie in cinema, and nobody said anything to her) I don't think me \"whining\" about discomfort of carrying a baby is too much.Lately, they even upped the game saying stuff like they won't come by our place when the baby is there (I mean where should I put the baby???) and saying stuff like \"nice knowing you\", \"ah now you won't be able to go to concert with us\" (even tho when the concert happens baby will be 7 months old and I have tickets and plan to go).One went so far to tell me they don't even wanna met my baby, and that's when I lost it and called them all cruel. This resulted in backlash, calling me selfish asshole because I decided to have kids and I shouldn't be imposing the kid on them.Thing is....I am not imposing anything. The kid will simply be there and I never ever mentioned anything about them babysitting or looking after or in any way shape or form being included in baby's life. Just think I am going through something life changing (whether it was my decision or not) and just don't want them to dump shit on me whenever I mention anything related to my pregnancy or baby. I dunno, they all made some bad decisions in their lives, we all did, and we all were there for each other and this feels like I am their personal landfill because of their own issues with natalism/antinatalism.Opinions?",

Despite my attempts to apologize, she hasn't contacted me since.AITA for eating a chicken sandwich?(EDIT: Regarding your questions...My sister has a history of creating scenes at restaurants when she spots someone (at a different table) ordering meat.

First pregnancy was natural, but we had to do IVF this time and I had bleeding issues which finally got resolved. I quit my RN job during IVF process because it was too much.Also fluid around baby’s heart scare with the baby, and got into minor car accident at 12 weeks pregnant, plus we were renovating our house and we had to fire our first team.Thankfully most of the problems are gone (baby is healthy, renovations almost done, etc) but I have been very emotional lately.I also grew up in a household where my parents fought over money ALL the time (we were poor immigrants)which traumatized me.Anyway, I am very sensitive and touchy with money due to this, and my husband knows this.Basically when I got home he was complaining that I don’t listen to him at all(I sometimes do tone him out automatically I admit, not my intention though).I told him it’s not like I bought other expensive things, I bought groceries.He wanted me to apologize for not listening to him and I just burst into tears. I asked him to come with me to grocery shopping earlier but he was too tired so I just went by myself. I honestly didn’t remember about the conversation that we had this morning.We are out of kimchi(I am Korean and eats kimchi a lot) so I went to get stuff to make kimchi, plus few extra things, which added up.I told him I don’t want to talk right now, since I was emotional and was crying.He kept pressing me to “just say sorry”, so I got so angry at the moment I slammed the pot on the counter and said “I am sorry now get the hell out of my way”.I had to make dinner so I kept making dinner while sobbing, and while pot was boiling I went to the car to just to sit by myself to calm myself down.My husband came and told me he didn’t mean to make me upset and that he is sorry that he made me cry, and left me alone.I kept crying for 10 mins or so because again, money issue is my major trigger. We almost got divorced few years ago for this.

He said he would provide food, litter, etc for her and that when he came to pick her up (once he figured out what he wanted to do) he would pay me $200.Before agreeing, I asked him if Nala had been spayed. One of my cats, Binx, hasn't been fixed yet because I got him semi-recently and, as they're all male and strictly indoor cats, it hadn't been my top priority. He reassured me that Nala had been spayed and I agreed to take her in for the month.The issues started in the second week. I messaged Terry to let him know that Nala's food and litter were running low, and he said he would send me the money to replace it. After two days (and constant asking) he still hadn't sent it, so I bought her food and litter with my own money. At the end of the month I asked Terry when he would be coming to pick her up. He never gave me an answer.Around the six week mark, Nala was sitting in my lap and I noticed she'd gotten fat. I was sure she was pregnant and messaged Terry to ask him again if Nala had been spayed. He admitted that she was not, and explained that he was worried I wouldn't take her in if he told me the truth. I told him that I still would have taken her in, but if I had known, I could have kept her away from Binx. Terry said that it was my cat who got Nala pregnant and I could deal with it.I got angry then and told him he would be taking Nala back, with the kittens, the next time he came to visit his parents. Well, he never did. Nala had the kittens two weeks ago and they are still in my care. I now have nine cats to take care of and I work full time. Seeing as Terry told me the cats were my problem because it was Binx who knocked Nala up, I decided to sell them to a few friends of mine who I know to be responsible cat owners. I posted some pictures of one of my friends visiting her kitten (they are still too little to separate from Nala yet), and Terry messaged me saying I needed to give him half of whatever I made from selling the kittens. I told him that because he never gave me the money for Nala's food and care, I would be keeping the money from selling them and we could call it even. I told him he is welcome to pick up Nala and the kittens and sell them on his own, but he said he couldn't. Now my aunt is angry at me and saying it's only fair to give Terry half of the money.",

Im a pretty big gift giver because I love shopping for others. I don’t get expensive stuff necessarily but mostly things that people don’t normally get themselves because it’s not practical but is fun!Anyway so this year my best friend (Sam) got an SO (Nicky)  Since they are a pretty new couple Nicky only got her a sweater. Think something from Target. Sam of course loved it but it was apparent to everyone when they opened my gift (a cute hat from their fave fandom styled after their fav character) their reaction was bigger.Nicky looked upset and didn’t say anything much to anyone for the rest of our Christmas celebration.Weeks later Nicky hasn’t greeted me at all and Sam is reluctant to talk about but did confirm that it was about the gift. Apparently they felt like I outshined them since I spent more and did something more significant to their likes than them.I wanna say that it’s silly and that of course since I’m Sam’s best friend I’d probably know a better gift than someone new. But my own SO thinks I’m being insensitive with my attitude and I maybe should tone it down with future gifts.So am I TA?",

For the second half of winter break, my roommate was going to a special class my school offers that’s not at the school and she brought my dog to my dads house to stay with us (my dad gave prior approval). My dad (51M) has always been very nice to my dog before and even got him some special treats and things for at his house. The night before my dad was going to take us back to our campus for the spring semester, he made us sandwiches for dinner. Now, my dad is a notorious food thief (which I warned my dad of before he agreed to letting him stay over) and my roommate and I have been actively working on training my dog to not take food, toys, etc that aren’t his. While I was eating, my dad set his food down near my dog, well within his reach. I wasn’t really paying attention since I had already started eating, and my dad wasn’t watching his plate. Well, my dog decided to sample the bread and licked one of the sandwiches as my dad turned back around to them. My dad’s response to this was to yell in my dogs face and call him a “f*ckin a**hole.” I told my dad I was sorry for not paying closer attention but that he could absolutely NOT yell at my dog like that. My dog is a rescue and has been wary of men since we got him so my dad yelling at him could undo a lot of progress we have made with his fearfulness, and also you just shouldn’t yell in an animal’s face like that. My dad went on a tangent saying I needed to train my dog and I was basically saying it was okay for him to steal food. I told my dad that I am training him to not take things and that I do not think it is okay for my dog is to steal food, but since he is a rescue yelling at him is not safe for him (or my dad if my dog had become defensive) and I raised my voice when I said this. Just to clarify: my dad has every right to be upset about some of his food having to be tossed out, and if he had just said “no” or something that my dog knows strictly after I wouldn’t be upset, it’s mainly that he yelled in his face. After that ordeal I couldn’t be in the same room with my dad so my dog and I went back to my room. I told some friends and close family about the situation and some say I overreacted and others say my dad was in the wrong. So, AITA?TLDR: My dad yelled and cursed in my dogs face for licking his sandwich. I raised my voice at my dad and told him he can’t yell in my dogs face because it would undo all the work we have done regarding his fearfulness after he was adopted. Some friends and family say my dad was out of line, some say I overreacted.",

I moved into the bigger room when he moved out. He knew when he moved out that if he moved back, he’d have the smaller room.

He said he’d pay more board to our mum and reimburse me for any of the things I couldn’t fit in the small room.

My mum offered to pay for shelving but it would honestly be such a struggle to fit everything I have in that room.

Ben knew but said nothing about it then.Since last month Ben had been regularly having a classmate over, John. They usually be playing video games or hanging out in his room or outside. They've never specified their relationship but we kind of get it, and I gave Ben some rules that he needed to follow such as no overnights, no bringing unannounced and volume down when I am working etc which they respected.Ben and Mary's had become tense, mostly about him complaining that her works disturb him and she should stop. I am not sure if Ben always felt this way or if John affected him, he has always been very respectful of others, but he does get easily swayed.Their quarrels have become increasingly aggressive. I was getting annoyed too. It used to be just me and Mary and now there is a stranger(John) constantly in the house and my siblings are always fighting.

They even peed on my Christmas tree. I was so furious. They throw up sometimes and I have to clean it.

Now onto the argument,  I've always had a good relationship with my in-laws so I very politely said no thank you we've picked another cot. As I didn't want to make waves and upset anyone from declining her offer.i showed mil the cot i wanted but Mil didn't offer to buy a new one for us or offer to buy anything for the baby ( which is their first grandchild ) which I though was very strange as they are fairly well off. Where as my family aren't well off and have always insisted on buying things for the babies. I can easily buy everything myself I just thought it would of been a nice thing for them to offer. My bf has slight autism so doesn't always understand stuff so he couldn't see why I didn't want to use the cot. I explained that I didn't find it hygienic to use a 37 year old cot thats had about 15 babies use it when we can just easily buy a new one ( it's not an expensive  one) I also explained that it was a unnecessary risk to the baby given its age and that we don't know how its been stored so it could have mold or rot, And that I wasn't comfortable with it and to me it was just common sense not to use it. He agreed that we wouldn't have it in our house. Now THE BIG PROBLEM . His mum said the other day how she was bringing the cot to HER house to use for when she baby sits. Which hasn't been discussed with us at all! Now im my perspective where she is lacking in common sense I don't feel comfortable her babysitting my baby and told my bf so. (I got pressured into having 2 people babysit my other kids when they was babies and both times ended very badly so now I don't trust anyone with my kids.) My saying I don't want his mum babysitting started a massive argument as i won't be pressured into something I'm not comfortable with.

I really don't want to be stuck with a mamas boy who doesn't put his foot down, because imo if its your parents you deal with them and I don't want a mil who doesn't listen and the whole thing is stressing me out and causing alot of arguments. So reddit am I the arsehole for not wanting to let my newborn sleep in a nearly 40 year old cot and not letting my mil babysit?",

	"body" : "I usually get my reddit 2nd hand on Instagram so I’m sorry if I’m doing this wrong!My upstairs neighbour (M40s) keeps me (F34) awake at night because I can hear him snoring through my ceiling.  I‘ve lived here for almost 2 years, it’s a small apartment building and I never hear my neighbours either side of me at all, absolutely nothing.  I try to walk lightly and don’t bang around at odd hours because I’m on the middle floor and have lived in a lot of noisier apartments so learnt to be considerate to the people below me.My upstairs neighbours are a little more oblivious to the noise they make but I usually work long hours so it only really bothered me on my days off and they have small children and kids will be kids, I don’t mind them running around as long as it’s not constant. I can sometimes hear them banging pots and pans, turning their taps on as it makes the pipes whine, but I’ve lived in worse so a bit of ‘living’ noise doesn’t bother me.  The thing that has become more obvious to me though is if I don’t get to sleep before the guy that lives upstairs does (which is rarely) his snoring will keep me awake.I‘m a night owl anyway, I do struggle with insomnia and my generally not so great mental health is pretty low as I’m currently unemployed, apart from a few bar shifts, due to strikes having a knock on effect on the usual industry I work in, so I’m noticing the snoring a lot more now than I did over the last 2 years.  Although I have previously been kept awake about once a week, I was exhausted enough from work/gym/etc that I’ll just fall asleep all the other days but it’s now pretty constant.WIBTA if I told him I could hear him? I’m aware I’ve been here for 2 years and he would be like why now? And also I’m aware it’s something people can’t always control and I don’t want to insinuate he needs to get it fixed. I don’t know how his family sleep through the noise being in the same apartment but if they haven’t asked him to try to fix it then why should a stranger feel entitled to ask!  I’ve only met him a few times, he’s a nice guy and I don’t want to be rude but I really need some sleep!EDIT:Editing to add that I use a fan and music and can still hear him, I tried earplugs but imma side sleeper and found them too uncomfortable.going to try earplugs again and white noise machine, thank you to everyone offering me advice",

My wife has basically become a second mother to Jesse and we have both been helping out Katie as much as possible, as Katie and the father are no longer together. He still does his part but since Katie still lives with us, Jesse is with us most of the time.I would rather not have Katie still living with us but she had nowhere else to go so we couldn’t kick her out with a child. My wife doesn’t have as much of a problem with her living at home as I do, but the main thing that annoys me is that Katie spends her money on stupid things that she doesn’t need instead of saving up for her own place. We’ve given her so much and she basically just throws it back in our faces.Jesse is starting to walk around furniture and is getting more adventurous, so Katie bought corner protectors and cabinet locks to put around the house as well as baby gates. She came to me and asked me if I could help her put them on stuff and put up the gates, but I told her that I didn’t want to start putting all of that around my house. She said we need them up to keep Jesse from hurting himself, but I reminded her that Jesse has a whole nursery that he can learn to walk in, so he doesn’t need to be walking around the kitchen or living room or any other room, and it’s her responsibility to make sure he doesn’t injure himself. We got into an argument about it and I basically told her she should he saving her money to get her own place where she can do whatever she wants instead of buying more things to put in my house.She got pretty upset but I think she got the message because she hasn’t talked about putting them up since. My wife asked me why I wouldn’t help her out and I told her that if we start childproofing our house, it will give Katie the impression that we’re willing to accommodate her and Jesse for as long as she wants and that she can live with us for god knows how long. I just don’t want her thinking her that she can live with us forever because as much as I love her and Jesse, the sooner they move out the better because it’s a lot of extra work for my wife and I.",

Toys are scattered everywhere downstairs (living room, kitchen, entryway), food is caked onto the kitchen floor and the high chair from the infant, and dishes are left out with food hardening on them.In addition, things just start to pile up around the house over time from never being put away. Clothes are tossed on or at the base of the stairs until they are a huge pile, things that have been taken out are just left on the tables or countertops until those are piled up as well. Some of this stuff is kid items but some are also my spouse's items that are used and never put away. Our bedroom has food and trash everywhere and every night our bed has crumbs all over because our kids wake up (8-9 AM) and my spouse sends them downstairs to get food to eat in bed with them so my spouse can sleep more.Every few months we have people over for some reason or another and there is always a fight leading up to it because of the mess. It takes us multiple days of cleaning for hours a day to get the house in a state where we can have guests over. I get extremely frustrated because the bulk of our cleaning comes from cleaning up the accrued daily mess that happens while I am working.  We clean up for multiple days to have people over and within a week the house is back to where it looks like we never cleaned at all.I understand that being a stay at home spouse and caring for kids is a job in it's own right but I feel like part of that includes picking up after the kids so we aren't left with this giant mess constantly. If things were picked up throughout the day then we wouldn't have such a large list of things to do once the kids are in bed. I also feel that if you take something out to use, you put it away when you are done instead of leaving it on the counter.I'm not expecting my spouse to do things like clean the bathrooms or do all the dishes daily, just pick up after themselves and the kids during the day as they go.

I work nights so this was around 5:30pm. I was working 6pm-6am the following morning. He came and got me and I asked if he would be able to pick me up in the morning before going to work. He agreed and that was fine.

He jokingly (I thought) said no and then gave me £20 for a taxi back home. Which I thought was quite thoughtful. Whilst at work one of the higher up managers asked if I could help her on a new project the following afternoon as it would be good for my career development and I just immediately agreed. Then remembered about my car! So I messaged my husband excitedly about the opportunity and said I’d need to use his car tomorrow if mine still wouldn’t start. He send me a meme saying no but I just thought he was having a laugh. We are both insured on each others cars. However we don’t ever need to use each others and he also has a van for work. Thi morning he told me I was not allowed to take his car as I had never driven it before and that I should’ve said no when my boss asked for help.

She texted my friend saying that she doesn't feel like she can trust her anymore and she that doesn't feel comfortable being around her anymore.My friend never responded (which when confronted about it she said that the response was unwarranted and extreme), which in turn just hurt my girlfriend's feelings more.

He said, \"Sorry, and that won't happen again.\"On a side note, my boyfriend is really kind, generous, and funny, and I know he'll be a good father (I see how he was with kids).Today, I'm on my day off, I work a graveyard shift, which is opposite of his.

I called him twice on Messenger, and he didn't pick up. The third time I called him, he chatted, saying he was in the game, so I waited.After a few minutes, he called back, and both of us were just in a good mood. Then silence took over. I was just staring at him as he was so close on his phone (not sure if he was browsing on social media or reading something), so I kept quiet.

I was about to respond to that, but I chose not to. Minutes later, he's calling nonstop, and I don't have a plan for answering it because I know where it's going to end.

Don't you know how to use your phone's camera? Worthless. What? you gonna cry again? You're so dramatic. F*ck you and other stuff. He even said he's sick of this and is just waiting for the call to end, and he's gonna  block me. In this kind of situation, I usually don't talk back coz I don't wanna match his energy, and I don't wanna say things that I might regret later.When he's starting to act like that, I still stay on the call, but when it's really not bearable for me, I just hang up the call.After every argument, he will just say sorry as if he did not disrespect me, thinking I'm gonna be  okay in just one snap.I have a lot of patience, but this has been happening for a while now.",

I had the next day off. My wife called me and asked if I could pick up her mom from the hospital in my car and take her to her village. I was somewhat surprised at this. As I said, I live a routine, and by my calculations, it would have taken me at least 4 hours to do what my wife was asking me to do. My mother-in-law is a really VERY slow walker, so just getting to the parking lot with her would be an ordeal. And then it's also too long to get to her village and back. I asked why her mom couldn't take a cab to her house. My wife complained that the drivers she knew would not be working that evening, and since it was getting dark very early where we lived, she was afraid to let her sick mom go with unfamiliar cab drivers in the dark, especially since there was no cell phone reception on the road.So, I said no. Perhaps if I had been warned about it at least a week in advance I would have been able to mentally prepare myself, but I was only warned a few hours in advance. My wife was almost in tears and asked if I could then at least pick up her mom from the hospital and bring her to our house to spend the night and help her get a cab in the morning. I again refused because, like I said, my mother-in-law walks very slowly. I would still lose several hours of my time and more importantly sleep. Going to bed two hours late doesn't sound so scary, but not to me.My wife reminded me that when I didn't have enough money for the car I drive now, my mother-in-law gave me the money at no cost.I replied that I was very grateful to my mother-in-law for the help with money she gives us every time, and I would really like to help her, but I can't. My wife asked if I didn't have the next day off and I said that yes, I did and I would like to at least keep my routine on my day off.My wife didn't say anything else to me. I found out later that she did find a cab for her mother (and how loudly she had proclaimed before that it wouldn't be safe, heh), but as she was coming down the stairs outside, she slipped and fell.

She's tried to put a stop to me and Noel doing anything together.I got an offer from my top choice university recently (fine art), which is great because it means I wouldn't have to move out into halls as it is relatively close to our place. However, Courtney and I got into a really bad argument (she found a pregnancy test and escalated the situation), and she's demanded that I move out. She said it's unfair to 'scrounge' from Noel, and that she wants to be able to raise her baby in peace with her partner, without someone getting their uni experience.Noel heard about it and he got pretty upset that she'd make such demands, but our mam has been arguing that living with Noel when he is starting a family is over the top, and that I'm old enough to either move back in with her or find my own place.",

	"body" : "I (28F) have been with my boyfriend (30M) for almost three years now. We moved in together about two years ago. When we moved in together I started noticing that he would often come right to bed without brushing his teeth. When I would bring it up he would say he’s too tired and would brush them in the morning. Over time, I realized he often wasn’t brushing them in the morning, either. He didn’t NEVER brush his teeth, he insists he brushes once a day, but in reality it’s like once every other day or so. This is a really foreign concept to me, as I don’t feel comfortable going to sleep without brushing my teeth and feel gross if I leave the house in the morning without brushing them.I blocked his way from going to work without brushing them just now and he joked that he’s “living in a prison”. We’d been talking about dealbreakers (theoretically) a couple days before and so I said that “basic hygiene is a dealbreaker for me” and he asked lightheartedly if my love for him was that fickle.  I said yes, and he brushed his teeth before leaving.It’s a topic we talk about constantly but haven’t made much progress. When I take a more serious tone with it he seems to be a bit defensive/annoyed so I haven’t pressed it too much. I honestly think it’s really gross that he’s not consistently brushing his teeth, and I’m worried about his long term dental health. WIBTA if I put the joking aside and seriously insist he must brush them twice a day, every day?Edit: He hasn’t been to a dentist since we started dating for insurance reasons, his breath does smell really bad in the morning but he’s over a head taller than me so it’s not in my face unless we’re being intimate or lying in bed. I have stopped him from kissing me and made him brush his teeth before because of it. Often if it’s midday the coffee smell on his breath masks it.",

Nothing new for online gaming, people insult each other all the time.Joined the squad, they talked and telling jokes, I told a few back and they laughed. Back and forth on the jokes, insulting this guys mother and how long the line was at her house stuff like that. More jokes told from both sides. They said that I was a lonely fat loser who got no pussy, I said I have a gf and that’s when the main guy/insulter said that she was a fat whore with saggy tits. I said no that’s your mother and more laughs from the rest of the squad. He doubled down again and I said she’s 180 and not even close to 300 pounds.Girlfriend comes over and I hand the headset to her and she says hello since the other squad mates wanted to say hi. Now I can’t say what was said during this time as the sound was only coming from the headset, but from what my girlfriend said the main insulter guy was calling her a fat whore with saggy tits that touch her belly. She was understandable upset and quickly handed the headset back, the other squad mates said it was a dick move and he should calm down and I agreed. I stopped talking and just sat in silence and played not engaging with anyone, I didn’t want to leave the squad as the rest of the guys were decent but I ended up leaving after a bit anyways. Main insulter said he felt bad because he “broke up the relationship” and was berated by the rest of the squad mates for being too harsh.Later gf and I had a fight about it saying that she felt disrespected by the guy, that I should of stood up for and defended her and I shouldn’t be playing with them. I said I don’t know them, never played with them before and probably never will again. I didn’t defend her which I know was wrong, but as most of us have delt with these types of screaming/baiters before it’s best not to engage with them because nothing you do will make them stop other than leaving or just not engaging. She said that she feels disgusted because what if that happens in person and how does she know that I’ll defend her. I said that it was different in person and related it to typing a comment online where a person could say whatever you wanted and you gotta ignore the ragers/baiters online.TLDR- Random screamer/baiter in a video game insulted my gf. Gf says I should have stood up, I didn’t because there’s no way to deal with screamers besides ignoring or leaving the gameSo am I the asshole for not defending her from a screaming/baiter online who was insulting her?Thoughts?

In the vaccation that's coming up, my club is hosting a camp. This camp will last friday trough monday (4 days). The week after the vaccatoin is filled to the brim with tests.My parents want to go on a skieng trip. I've never enjoyed skieng, which would be fine if I had any friends there or enjoyed the other activities we'd do. I'm curently being tested for autism, so you can guess that I don't enjoy partying or joining my parents with their friends. I also find it hard to make friends, so I am friends with none of the children of my parent's friends. Basically, my parents are asking me to join them on a vaccation that would mean total isolation from my peers.I've joined them on skieng trips before, and they're using that as evidence that I do enjoy it. That is simply not true. I didn't have a choice in wether or not I got to come with, and there was nothing I could do exept for skieng. Sitting in a shitty hotel room the entire day seems even less fun than being out on the snow.I also function as a free nanny the entire time we're on the trip. My parents and other parents leave their kids with me while they go off to god knows where. It's fine if it's just my siblings, if not anoying, but i'm sick of being the sole caretaker of a bunch of 10 year olds.I'm also a huge people pleaser, so I often chose other peoples wishes and needs above my own. This is the one time I ask for my wants to be put above theirs, but I'm shut down. I just honestly don't understand why they're so dead set on wanting me to come with. I'd be misserable. Isn't it better to have your child be happy on their own than to have them misserable with you?My pros and cons list in staying home:Pros:- Getting to spend 4 days doing my favourite thing and hanging out with my favourite people- I can spend the free time I have after the camp hanging out with friends- I have to spend time studying, and doing so at home is way nicer- I have access to all the materials I need to engage in my hobbies- I have a bunch of free time and no one will bother meCons:- I genuinely can't think of anythingMy parent's pros and cons list of me staying home:Cons:- Leaving child alone feels weird- No free nanny- No one to play games with when boredPros:- vacation costs less moneyI'm willing to pay the fee of the camp myself, so that wouldn't cost them any money either. I just really want to spend time doing what I love instead of spending a week being miserable. I have no friends, my parents (esp my dad) are pent up and I'll probably get yelled at a bunch, and I can't properly study for my tests.All in all, it just sucks for me. Imo.

We got a new fridge about 2 months ago that you can get ice or water out of the front. The problem arose when our cousin (35M) who's been staying with us for the past 2 years started giving the dogs water out of the water dispenser. He's the one who gives them food and water at night and in the morning (out of choice).  He gives them that water because \"if we're drinking the water they deserve to as well\" but the water will splash and get all over as it goes into their bowls.  One of our dogs has rotting teeth (she should be getting them taken out soon) and it makes her breath HORRIBLE and our other dog licks his own pee so their slobber getting on the water dispenser makes me feel sick. A few hours ago I brought it up to my mom asking if we can switch them back to using the sink water and she said no. For some quick context, she doesn't use the water or ice dispenser. She drinks bottled water and I'm the main person who drinks the water out of the fridge. I asked her why she said no and when she didn't give an answer I got upset and we got into an argument. She says i‘m being overdramatic and that it's not that big of a deal if the water splashes out of the bowl but I say it is a big deal because I drink out of that and I don't want to drink their slobber. I also brought up that it would  be faster to fill up their bowls using the sink and now she's completely ignoring me and it's making me feel like maybe i'm the asshole. So... AITA??",

I asked him ‘are you ok’ maybe my tone wasn’t that warm or something, but my mum got angry at me for my tone (which was apparently rlly cold) and  for forgetting to apologise.

Yes I acknowledge I should have apologized but I really wasn’t in the mood to. Normally I do, and I asked him ‘are you ok?’ My mum started calling me useless and worthless, and ungrateful. She said that if it weren’t for her, my relationship with everyone would be crap and implied that no one would like me. I apologized for my behaviour today morning but she kept going. I don’t know how but I just started bawling (screaming plus crying) and she looked at me in disgust. My stepdad came over and asked me ‘what is wrong’ not in a caring way but like a ‘shut up’ manner. Again I apologized for screaming.I don’t know. I don’t know. I guess I feel like it’s my fault because I should have apologized to my stepdad in the first place, but I really thought it was ok.Also, sorry if my communication isn’t so good…..I’m not the best at communicating……",

My mum has to pay £260 a month and is behind on payments due to Christmas and my December birthday and her government benefits getting messed up. I told her that I’m trying to get a job to help her pay it off or to help buy things closer to the time such as clothes and travel items (toothbrush holders, a carry on, towels etc), but she told me to focus on my education and not rush to get a job since she can manage by herself.Earlier, I asked her if I could have £30 to go on a trip with my friends in March. She’s a single mother and trying her hardest, I get that,  but I don’t think she understands how isolating being a poor girl in a friend group of middle-class girls with jobs and two parents can be.

	"title" : "AITA if I breed perfect pokemon as gifts, but then also keep a perfect one of each for myself as well?",
	"body" : "Introductory paragraph, in case you know very little about Pokemon: there is actually a system in its main games that means each individual one has specific half-secret (because you can actually get a rough estimate of each one in-game, it just takes a long time until you unlock that feature) bonuses for each stat. They can be pretty low or pretty high and max out at 31 for each of the six stats (Health/two kinds of Attack/two kinds of Defense/Speed). Pokemon can pass these on to their offspring, so if you start out with the right pokemon, you can breed \"perfect\" offspring that will have the highest possible bonus on each stat - and obviously it'll be stronger for it.I like breeding these perfect offsprings, because the monotony of throwing two pokemon into a daycare and then running all over the game, waiting for the egg to crack, is just very relaxing to me. And sometimes, I give some of the resulting pokemon to friends of mine, especially when I'm done breeding a specific pokemon that I know they like too.And on rarer occasions, I also breed pokemon specifically as a gift - either because someone's done something nice for me first or as an additional christmas/birthday gift or whatever. Then I let the person choose what pokemon I breed and guarantee them that they'll get a perfect version of it, within the time of their birthday/christmas/...I always thought that was kinda nice, because it meant my friends don't need to do the monotone breeding process themselves and still end up with powerhouses. But a friend of mine has just disagreed:He's saying that I shouldn't be calling them gifts, because according to him they aren't. That since I keep a perfect pokemon of everything I breed as well, I'm doing something that benefits me just as much, whenever I breed a \"gift\". That it's stupid to pass off something like this as a legitimate gift, because it's not like whoever I'm gifting the pokemon to is the only one benefitting from the effort I put in.So... essentially he's saying that if I really cared to make it a heartfelt gift, I'd release all the other perfect/good pokemon I hatched in the process of breeding one of the gifts. I feel like that'd be a huge waste of time and that it's natural to keep good breeding results for future use. AITA?",

I told him I was going to a casino to watch the band and hang out. He told me he was taking all the money from me but I could go. For context I did have a really bad gambling addiction a few years ago. I got upset and told him that was the farthest from my mind and that I have no urges to gamble again. I went out had fun and didn’t gamble. On Tuesday I went to lunch with my mom. My husband asked me what I was doing I told him in was at this casino. He asked why I was there. I responded with Gambling. Then followed up with the real reason why I was there. He realized I was being sarcastic but I feel like I took it too far after he has apologized to me for assuming I was going to gamble on new years.So AITAH for being petty to my husband.Edit:1. I am  actually a recovering alcoholic I been sober for 7 years. I got to bars all the time with my husband and family. It doesn’t bother me to be around the alcohol.2. We moved away from Nevada was gone for  a year we have been back in Nevada for over a year now. You can’t even go to the grocery store without having slot machines there.3. If gambling was a problem for me we would have had problem way before we even got married. Yes he was concerned but in my defense I have not snuck money or gambled our paychecks at all.",

	"body" : "So for context, I am 24f living with my husband 24m and his mother and her boyfriend. We lost our apartment in the heat of inflation and had to resort to moving in with her, and haven't been able to get back out of her home for the same reason. They have a long history of eating food that we bought/cooked as a way to save money for themselves. I also just discovered that I am pregnant, 10 weeks at the time of this post, also I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. Due to that, I have special dietary needs, as well as the typical first trimester morning sickness. I buy groceries every few weeks or so, mostly just for my husband and I. But recently I have started getting special food for instances like my pregnancy and gestational diabetes, to get me by. For this example, I am using this thing called FitButter that was chocolate chip cookie dough flavored protein butter. Now, I am supposed to eat every 2-3 hours except when sleeping, but because of how sick I've been feeling, I buy myself short term fixes like that which I only need to eat a spoonful of to count as a meal. Now these items I EXCESSIVELY mark my name all over it, add bright stickers even often to cover the labels and individually speak to the members of my household as to not eat it and educate them as to why (also this small jar about the size of my fist was $12 so I was particularly defensive over this). Today, I noticed when I went to go eat my first spoonful out of that jar, the stickers were peeling off... Odd. Oil was leaking out of the container causing the stickers and label to begin peeling. I then opened the container to find the seal of the butter to be taken off, and what they thought was so cleverly replaced into the jar, but the broken seal being put back into the lid is what was causing the oil to leak. It looked like a spoonful had been eaten out of it as well. Now tell me how this jar, with stickers plastered all over (including the lid) AND me individually talking to them about what this is and why I have it and why not to eat it, it's eaten anyway? My MIL and her bf flat out denied eating it, blaming it on my husband (he has food texture issues and gags at the sight of most protein foods, including this one, but he's not home so who cares), they gaslit me and said my pregnancy hormones are getting ridiculous for freaking out over something like this and other things just gaslighting me. My MIL then said \"It's no big deal we'll just buy you another jar to replace the supposed 'missing spoonful\". I told her that's fine, but I'm not driving back to the store that's an hour away to pay $12 for that jar then the hour back. She said \"f--- that\" and that's when I went \"yeah exactly. That's why I didn't want anyone touching it so I could only have it in times I really needed it.\" They stopped talking to me since and only communicate things to my husband now. AITA? If I am, someone please tell me what I am missing here.",

We moved in the summer and didn't have anyone over or drive the 4 hours for Thanksgiving so it was nice to spend the Christmas holiday with our families. The issue stems from opening the presents on Christmas morning. Because my fiance and I are so young and having just moved out on our own, we were on a very tight present budget but I did my best to get gifts tailored to the individual interests of my family. My family tends to usually go all out on Christmas within reason. Everyone around me, my fiance included, got lots of gifts tailored to what they wanted/were interested in. My parents asked me to make a list of things I wanted and my brother asked me for one as well. I got 3 presents, 2 had my fiances name on them as well as mine and the only one with just my name was from my brother. It's important to note here that I am pagan whereas my brother has become a very very rigid Christian. I asked for things like candles, crystals, and a couple steampunk style shirts in general. I got a vacuum and a toaster that I didn't ask for from my parents and my brother gave me a cookbook because he doesn't want me to be a \" crystal girl\".

Right away the lady who was shaking with anger holding both hands up with balled fists told my wife “ I am sick and tired of your kids running around and making noise from morning to night.” My wife responded with “ I don’t know what you want me to do with a 4 year old.” . The old woman’s response was “I don’t care, it’s common courtesy, if you don’t stop I will call the cops.” My wife responded back with “Alright, I’ll try to stop my toddlers from playing” while going to close the door. The old woman chose to end with  “they make noise till one in the morning and it’s ridiculous” by which point the door was closed and locked.My children are down for bed by 9 every night, a complete hour before the 10pm curfew of the complex, but on rare occasion my daughter has woken up and refused to sleep early in the morning but she has never been allowed to run around and make noise when that happens.Where I think we could be the assholes is that we don’t restrict our children from playing how they would like aside from limiting them bashing the walls and floor with toys.",

	"body" : "I (25f) moved in with my mom (53f) over a year ago after my ex and I broke up and had to move out of our shared apartment. I have my own room and shared kitchen/living spaces with my mom. Things were okay between us until a few months into living together, when she bought us groceries (I paid rent and food money in one monthly payment for her to use towards groceries for both of us instead of each of us going shopping as she likes making meals for us to eat together) and she bought some snacks for me that I requested she buy when she went out for me to have at home. She then ate these snacks before I had a chance to even open the bag, and when I confronted her about it, she to me to “buy my own f-ing snacks” if I’m gonna complain. So that’s what I started doing. Eventually I started buying my own groceries and started also purchasing things shared like toilet paper and my own laundry detergent. The only shared things in the house were spices and sauces (unless I use a lot of sauce for cooking in which case I buy my own) lately, when I go shopping which I do once a month, I usually buy milk to keep in the fridge. I work an early shift, so I don’t always have breakfast as home and on the weekends I prefer bagels to cereal for breakfast so my milk usually lasts me 3 weeks or until it expires as I only use it for cooking dishes (mainly pasta) the problem, my mother has resorted to using my milk when she runs out of hers, and doesn’t want to go out to replace it. I don’t usually have a problem with this, except she took so long to replace my milk she used I didn’t have enough for dinner after work one night. In fact, I haven’t finished a whole carton of milk myself in the last three months. But lately she’s been having me make the stops to the store after my shift to buy the milk to replace mine (she does pay me, but she works from home meanwhile I have 8-10 hour shifts often with only 5mins to eat lunch) tonight was the final straw. She went in MY FOOD DRAWER (which she has done before when I’ve been gone for the weekend and ate my snacks and not replaced them by the time I get home) and seemed to want my chips, but she doesn’t ask, she just gets all excited like “ooo ketchup chips those would be good now” and I told her no those are mine, if she wanted some she should have got some on her last shopping trip. She then makes a snide quiet comment about not eating her cookies (my grandma made them for Christmas for the family) and I called her out on her being childish for saying these things with the intention of me not hearing it, and I shouldn’t have to share my snacks cause she didn’t get any herself. She has also taken my chocolate I’ve bought that same day and eaten all of it before I had to chance to have a bite. She’s now wanting me out of the house in 6 months because I won’t share.so AITA",

I ultimately ended up growing too fast by getting pulled from school to school, child services, overall used up for any government money my deceased father had left and a whopping $2.17 left in the bank account from her habits.After my brothers and I eventually moved in with my grandparents, my mom left and we didn't hear from her unless she brought stuff for my brothers and clothes that didn't fit for me. She would pick me apart and criticize me and then leave and we wouldn't see her for months. The second I graduated and turned 19, getting my first job, she was in my messages, texting me angrily when I wouldn't respond. The few times she visited, I wasn't home and she took an envelope full of money, some shoes of mine and something else but I don't remember it being that important. Completely went through my room when nobody had an eye on her. I came home and set my vest down and she thought taking pictures of my card information was the right thing to do. Unbeknownst to me thinking my mom had changed for good, I didn't even realize till she drained my account. She did this over and over and I kept running back hoping she had changed like a naive child. Even to the point where I let her crash at my apartment and she pulled the same stunt. It landed me evicted considering I had no money for gas, rent, and I worked in two towns over.After that was said and done, I moved to a new state with my aunt, leaving everyone behind for about three years and came back with my fiance. During that time I kept low to absolutely nc with my mom due to her being in and out of jail until I came back for my grandfather's funeral. She kept cancelling Ubers when I came to visit so that way I'd feel bad and give her a ride somewhere, or would not contact me after I told her I didn't have any money/not letting her come to my apartment. Now I don't talk to her unless she has something of value meaning new clothes that actually fit, bras, money, etc. Friends and family alike keep telling me I'm an AH for not giving her another chance and that if I loved my mom, I would forgive her ESPECIALLY since it's the holiday season, but I can't seem to do that.

Obviously we’re all in our last year of school so we don’t want any unnecessary drama or stress so we barely ever argue. Anyway for context I have dyed red hair, and to maintain the colour I have to use red shampoo, red conditioner, a red hair mask and to wash it under cold water. It’s tedious and my hairstylist also told me not to wash my hair too many times to maintain the colour. My hair is also extremely damaged so washing it too much would probably make me bald and that’s unfortunately not the look I’m going for, so I only wash it twice a week, and so I have an everything shower every time I wash my hair, kind of to kill two birds with one stone. Some of my friends find it disgusting, and keep telling me to wash it even though I’ve explained over and over again that it’s super hard to do that and I don’t want to end up balding or with fading hair, and they keep making jokes about how they can fry eggs in my hair and all that. I normally just laugh it off but it’s gotten so repetitive that laughing it off becomes an acquired skill that I have not mastered. They’re making me seem like this greasy slimeball monster but it’s not even like I’m unhygienic, I brush my teeth every morning and every night, shower at least once every day and never ever skip my morning and evening skincare routine, and the worst thing is that they’re always making these jokes in public at the top of their voices. So anyway the last two weeks were mocks week, and naturally my tedious everything shower routine wasn’t really a priority, and I had to show up to school bare-faced w greasy hair every day which was actually painful for me. All I did today was tell my friends that I was excited to be wearing makeup and pretty clothes to school for the first time in two weeks and finally looking like the cute hyper feminine girly girl I am and they’ve just hit me with a barrage of insults about how I’m so scary and how I can’t be feminine with my unwashed hair because apparently you have to wash your hair every single day. I literally know what to do when there’s grease in my hair, I always style it into a slick bun or any other cute hairstyle that I’ve always thought I look good in but the fact that I don’t wash my hair every day suddenly makes me look like a bloodied goat to the slaughter shitting fear diarrhoea everywhere with matted fur and a single dangly earring. They said I was and I quote, “disgusting” and “scary”, so I just explained that my hair stylist told me not to wash my hair more than twice a week, and they said that “[I] don’t need a licensed doctor or stylist to tell me to wash my hair every day”, so I just went off on them and told them that jokes are funny, but I’d appreciate it if they were at least doing it in a way that made me think they were minding their own business and not making me feel so ugly and so dirty and unfeminine. Am I the asshole for responding the way I did? ALSO, if it’s any solace to anyone, I’m typing this with WASHED hair!! and I’m planning on washing it again before school on Monday! edit: OKAY just wanted to clarify, my hair is nowhere near the point where it’s so damaged i need to cut or shave it, it’s not thin, it’s really thick, it’s not frizzy and it has improved since i started washing it this way! its not very healthy but it is smooth, once again thick and it is moisturised! it’s mostly to maintain the colour but tysm for the concern. it’s not fried at all, it was when i got a chemical perm done years ago in korea, and that took a lot of repairing, even chopped half my hair off that time to recover. it’s longer and healthier now! i’m only listening to my stylist but again tysm for all your concerns once again my hair is NORMAL, it’s not dead at all, but it could be if i don’t take care of it properly, im also just lazy i was just really really really mad when i was typing this so i was exaggerating the condition of my hair by a lot in the heat of the moment! my hair is as damaged as colour treated hair inevitably gets! i get regular hair treatments after colour every salon visit (tokio inkarami n olaplex) <3333",

We've been divorced for five years.Last week I got my son a watch which would allow him to text or call me at any time. It's been great all up until yesterday when he went back to his father's house. Let's call the father Chad.Chad texted me this morning to ask if he could be one of the contacts on the watch that our child is allowed to text/call. I said sure. And that it would only cost him $5 a month and that I would appreciate reimbursement for half the cost of the watch as well.I bought the watch out of pocket, I bought an extra charger for him to take to his dad's so the watch has power, and the line itself only costs me $10 a month.Chad is furious with me and claims that since I didn't consult with him about the watch he shouldn't have to pay. Chad also claims that since he wouldn't have admin control over the watch, he shouldn't have to pay. That since three other people have the ability to text our child and I'm not making them pay, he shouldn't have to pay either.For context, the watch does not have games on it so it's not like I'm giving him all kinds of unauthorized screen time. The watch cannot connect to the Internet. It's very basic.The watch has a limited number of contacts allowed on it. Very few. So I have put me, my brother, and my parents on it as contacts. If he wants to be a contact I then have to decide who in my family doesn't get to be a contact.Chad is more than welcome to continue to communicate with our child the same way he always has - which is to call me and I let them speak over my phone. I never deny him the opportunity to speak to our kid.I got our child the watch because Chad hardly responds to me when I try to contact our kid, maybe about 30% of the time. By me getting our kid a watch, I can more count on having communication with my son. I try to respect their time together and not interfere much.

I said \"No thanks, I don't need anything.\"After we'd gotten back in the car, she asked why I said things like that. I said \"like what?\", she said \"why do you say things like 'I don't need that\", or, 'not worth the calories?' Why can't you just say 'No thanks?' \"I said \"I've never really thought about it, I guess it's part of the mental gymnastics I do to keep myself from eating junk food.\" I also brought up about how years ago I was 30 lbs overweight, I starting eating better/exercising and I've kept it up.She said \"I wish you wouldn't say things like that, it makes me feel like you're judging me for what I'm eating.\" I said it can be struggle for me to eat properly and this is part of how I remind myself to stick to healthier options and avoid overeating. She said that when she offers to go get food, or is sitting on the couch eating snacks while we watch a show, and asks me if I want any, she doesn't want my \"commentary\" on whether I \"need\" something, or if something is \"worth the calories\" to me. She said \"just a short 'yes' or 'no' without elaboration is all I need from you.\" I said \"OK, I'll try to do that.\" She said \"in a few minutes I'll start eating this Hershey bar, and I'll ask you if you want some.\"I said \"Nope, I don't want any, thanks.\"After a short pause, she said she didn't want to bring this up, but that my response was \"too quick\" and it still felt like I was judging her.I said \"I gave a short response, no elaboration.\" She said \"yes, but your tone was judge-y and you responded too fast.\" I said \"It feels like I can't do anything right, I'm trying to give what you asked for, and it's still wrong.\"She said \"I knew you were going to take it this way, that's why I didn't want to bring it up, you don't want to hear my perspective and you don't want to admit that you might have done something wrong or that your response was problematic.\"I said \"I'm glad you told me so I can try to watch my tone and how quickly I respond in the future, but it still feels like I can't do anything right.\"She said \"You shouldn't feel that way. This is about how YOU made ME feel.\"I said \"that just how I feel right now.\"She said \"I get that being your initial response, but after I've explained it to you, you shouldn't feel that way anymore, since this is about how your response made me feel, not whether or not you feel like you're doing anything right. This is why I can't fucking talk to you, you make things about you when it's not about you. This is why I don't feel safe talking to you.\"I said \"I'm glad you brought up that you didn't like my response and I'm sorry I fell short, but I'm also allowed to have an emotional reaction, and you don't get to dictate what that is.\"She said \"here you go again, making it about you when it's not.\"So, Reddit, am I making this about me when it shouldn't be?

I live with my mum and see my dad for 1-2 days a month. I’ve never really got along with my dad because he cheated on my mum when I was a baby then married the woman he cheated with. I do love my dad but he isn’t involved in a lot of my mums decisions because when my parents divorced, they both decided my mum would get full custody and he could see me and my sister (18f) whenever.My sister has tons of piercings (23 i believe). Because my sister got so many piercings at around my age, I was allowed to get the same piercings as the piercings she got at my age. For example, my sister got her septum done when she was 13, so I did too. My sister has always been my dads favourite, so no matter how she dressed, what piercings she got, clothes she wore or colour she dyed her hair - she would never get even a snarky comment.Well I have 5 piercings currently. My ear lobes, septum, belly button and most recently my tongue. Now it’s easy to hide a septum piercing, you just flip it up. But a year ago my dad saw my belly button piercing and freaked out and called my mum to confirm i was allowed to get it done, my mum confirmed and stated she’s my primary parent and will make the decisions.Two days ago, I got my tongue pierced - and if you don’t know about tongue piercings, they swell up like crazy after you get them done. I saw my dad yesterday. He noticed my tongue piercing and started screaming, saying that i’ve ruined my body. I yelled back and explained how my sister had the same piercings as me when she was my age and that  a piece of metal in my body doesn’t affect my looks completely. I then proceeded to tell him he has no rights to any opinions on my looks (for example when he yelled at me for dying my blonde hair brown then yelled when i bleached it back to blonde). I don’t know if I was in the wrong for telling him he doesn’t have a right to my decisions and claiming he favourites my sister.",

I was carrying our child, and she was pushing the trolley, with me a couple of steps in front of her. As I joined the checkout line, I turned back to locate my wife and noticed another woman behind me with her own trolley. Seeing my wife behind this woman, I motioned for her to come around since I was ahead and ready to start unloading our items and checking out.This is where things took a turn. The woman behind me got upset and accused me of cutting in line, arguing that she should be first because my trolley wasn't with me; it was behind her. Ordinarily, I might have let it slide, but her accusatory attitude rubbed me the wrong way. Despite having no particular urgency, her tone prompted me to stand my ground.I explained to her that I had joined the queue before her, and since my wife and I were together, our collective position took priority. She countered, insisting that the physical location of the trolley mattered more, claiming I couldn't hold the spot for someone else. Our exchange continued with the same arguments until she eventually gave up and moved to another queue.To the best of my knowledge, the UK follows a \"first come, first serve\" rule for queuing, and I believe that by bringing my wife to my position, I wasn't violating any norms. We were conducting a single transaction for all the items, with me handling the payment. However, I'm curious to know if there's validity to the woman's point of view.So, AITA?",

Like all teachers she gives me rows and has an answer to everything, which is fine. This year I’ve started my AS qualifications and she teaches me for 2 out of 4 of my subjects which is great as previously stated we get on amazing.Most of my friends are in the younger years, year 10-11 which isn’t so bad as there’s a year, 2 most between us. I absolutely love my friends as they’ve been there for me through everything even though they are a bit younger than me.I bumped into my teacher in the corridor while she was on duty and we got to talking. We started talking about the people I hang out with, which I told her that I like my friends in the younger years as they get me more than my “friends” in my year do. The people in my year group I absolutely hate, they’re all fake with nothing better to do than talk about another and then be fake friends with them as soon as they walk into the room. I explained all this to her and she told me: “You’re in year 12 now, you shouldn’t be hanging around those people, while they’re trying to get out of lesson you are in yours. They will pull you down with them and you will fail. You need to cut them out of your life before they ruin it.” She said some other things that I don’t really remember much but they were along the same lines. This really ticked me off as those girls are my life so I just started screaming at her, I have never in my life yelled at her before so this came as a shock to anyone that was in the same corridor as us. I just carried on yelling like it was nothing.As I was yelling, my head of year and assistant head walked by and just stood and stared at me while I was still yelling. She had made me really mad and upset and that had set me off. As soon as I stopped yelling I realised who was there and how many people were staring and I immediately felt bad. I apologised immediately and ran off hoping it wouldn’t come up again.I had her later that day and she kept me behind to talk about what had happened and I explained that I was sorry but she was out of line.Looking back at it now she was just looking out for me and she didn’t deserve to be spoken to like that in front of her students and peers. I still stand by my points and do not regret yelling at her, we are still as close as we’ve ever been. But people are telling me that I was the asshole for reacting like that.So AITA for yelling at my teacher?EDIT: Just to add, I apologised immensely and done so for a few days after. We had a sit down and a talk about what happened and why I had lashed out. We talked it through and we’re completely fine. She said she understood why I lashed out but if I feel that way about something she says again to go see her privately, which I have done. I understand what I done was out of line but I made amends. She is my favourite teacher and I would never do anything to ruin our relationship on purpose. Anyone who bottles things up and takes it out on the wrong people should understand. I am also neurodivergent which I now understand may have had a role in my outburst.I am so thankful to have a teacher that understands me and instead of yelling back, just talks to me.Yes I am still friends with the girls in the younger years and no I will not be dropping them.",

When I do get home, he's always quick to close everything up and turn the thermostat on, but it still takes at least an hour for the apartment to warm up to a comfortable temperature. It's not even like he's an \"I don't feel the cold\" guy. When I get home, I'll often find him sitting at his desk bundled up in a sweater, hat, and blanket.I've asked him why he does this, and he's explained that he \"just likes the fresh air\", that it \"makes the place smell good\" and that, \"the Germans do it all the time.\" (The last explanation is the weirdest to me because we're not German.)

I got on the floor in a ball one room over from the kitchen as the position comforts me, plugged my ears, and just wanted to wait for it to stop so I could calm down. The fire was out so as far as I was concerned there was no danger left to keep my adrenaline going and I was safely able to do this.My mother SCREAMED at me for this, telling me to go outside. I hated this idea because it was very cold and I didn't want to unplug my ears to get up, but she kept screaming and it was so overwhelming with the loud beeping that I got up and did as she said.

She knows I'm autistic and is usually pretty good at handling it, so I'm almost disappointed on top of it all.

I wasn't clearheaded, I was breaking down. Yelling at me didn't stop me shutting down, it just made me take it elsewhere.I helped her clean the oven off but otherwise I feel pretty coldly about her right now.

She said she had plans to go away with her kids and her friends with their families that weekend. The fact I wasn’t invited makes me think they all realised I’d be busy for sons birthday but I don’t know. The other friends have kids Ashley’s kids age so they are closer I only see them at events that don’t include kids due to I’ve only got my one son who is independent.Ashley has known for 18 years  the date is my sons birthday but still made these plans. I just said okay and didn’t bring it up again and Ashley never asked again about it other than after she came back from her trip to ask how the party went , I kept it very brief just saying it went well , son had a fun night. I know my son didn’t notice that his aunt didn’t come and he had a great night but I’m still sour that Ashley chose her friends over this milestone.WIBTA if I tell Ashley I’m disappointed that she didn’t come as it won’t change the past but I do feel a resentment inside me towards her",

	"title" : "AITA For scheduling appointments in the evening before I go on vacation",
	"body" : "I (37F) am going on a trip to Mexico with a couple of friends.  We are leaving tomorrow morning and will be coming back next Wednesday night so it's not an incredibly long trip.  Not even a full week.  This trip was supposed to be in early December, but one of the friends had a death in their family so we rescheduled it and this was the only time that worked for everyone.  Due to our family being very busy during the holidays, I did not have time to do a lot of things I wanted to do to prepare for my trip.I needed to get my hair done, my nails, a few tanning sessions, shopping, etc.  We were out of town last weekend to celebrate the New Year with my family, so this week was the only time I could get that stuff scheduled and done.  But, I also work full-time so I had to schedule and do all these things in the evening.Needless to say, my husband (38M) is not happy AT ALL right now.  He's being super moody and short with me every time I try to talk with him.  Pretty much everything he says to me is a complaint about how not only am I going on a trip, but that I've also been out of the house pretty much all week and leaving him at home with our 3 kids.  He told me that I should have either not done things like get my hair and nails done, or try to schedule them over my lunch break so that I can be home and present with the family in the evenings.When I explained to him that scheduling these things is not as easy as him walking into Sports Clips and getting a quick haircut, he told me \"That doesn't mean you get to just skip out on being a parent for 2 whole weeks.\"He was supposed to drive me and one other friend to the airport, but last night he told me that I need to take an Uber because he's not packing the kids into the car to bring us there.  Our kids are too young to leave home alone.  But it's a 45-minute drive to the airport and our flight leaves at 8am, so we need to be at the airport around 5am and getting an Uber for that time is tough.  He told me that isn't his problem even though he agreed to take us weeks ago and now we're scrambling to figure out how to get there.He said that was before he had to spend all week doing everything at home and with the kids by himself while I was off pampering myself so that I can go pamper myself on a beach for another week while he's at home.I've been practically begging him to take us to the airport because that's what he said he would do, but he's refusing and is outright telling me it's because he's too tired because I wasn't home all week.  He told me I should have skipped some of the things like nails and/or hair or scheduled them at more convenient times.It's not like I wasn't home at all during the week, I just wasn't home as much as I normally am.  I scheduled appointments for when they had openings and had to take what I could get.  He doesn't understand that I can't just walk in and get these things done whenever I want.",

	"body" : "I’m a college student, I work a part time job and intern as a personal trainer. I cook quite a bit because It’s my lifestyle. Last week, I decided to make a new recipe which had me tenderize chicken, took me a minute to tenderize all of them and a couple minutes later I get a knock on my door, it’s my neighbor saying to stop banging on the wall. My girlfriend responds with “We’re just cooking, we can hear you guys in the kitchen too.” and he just responded with “Oh.” and left. Fast forward pretty much a week later and I’m making the same recipe, I just knew they were going to complain again. A minute after I tenderized the chicken they decided to bang on the wall to send a message. I was already done tenderizing the chicken and that was the last of noise, it lasted 1 minute.Now the issue that’s bothering me the most is this woman (she’s like 19) is pregnant. Her boyfriend has been smoking cigarettes and weed inside, and me and my gf have literally seen him open the window to blow it out when we arrived home one night. The scent lingers in the hallways badly, and sometimes even leaks into our apartment. How can they be mad about a 1 minute inconvenience when they are smoking indoors, even during 60 degree weather??Not sure what to do here, we cook between 6pm-7pm, we told them once that we were cooking and the noise only lasted a minute. Thought they would maybe be understanding that we’re not constantly making loud noises it’s only a once in awhile thing, but right as I tenderize meat I’m a terrible person. I tried to tenderize further away from their wall yesterday but clearly it didn’t work, I don’t know why I should accommodate for these people when they don’t consider us.",

	"body" : "I (18F) am a senior in high school. My family and I do not live in the US and to avoid giving too many details i’ll just say we live somewhere in Africa. My dad (59M) is kind of your typical african father. He’s not overly strict but still demands a lot of respect and refuses to hear me out most of the time. I usually have to talk issues through with my mom (55F) who calmly explains the issue to him in a way that doesn’t make him angry. I’m in therapy (for anxiety and other shit) and have been trying to work on my relationship with him but the fact that he usually doesn’t hear me out bothers me a lot.On to what happened the other day. It was around 8pm on a Tuesday and I had just gotten out of the shower. I was in shorts and a tank top (my typical pajamas) when my dad knocks repeatedly on my door. When I open the door, he’s standing there with 3 guests: 2 adults and their kid who’s around my age. Without hesitation he drags me out to greet them and immediately told me to entertain their daughter. I was super uncomfortable as the pajamas I was wearing were a bit too revealing to be wearing around guests and my hair was tied up in an unflattering way since I expected to be alone for the rest of the night. I complied out of obligation but didn’t expect to be serving and entertaining their guests for the next 4 hours. I was already stressed out and anxious that day as I had assignments I needed to work on before being interrupted. This led to me having a sort of panic attack in the kitchen (they were all in the living room) as I begged my mom to let my dad know that I needed a heads up before becoming their personal maid and entertainer (I said it alot more politely of course). This led to being lectured about how I don’t always get a heads up in life and I shouldn’t be acting this way over something so small. I told my parents they need to provide me with some heads up if they expect something like this and it wasn’t fair to me, then went upstairs to finish my assignments. I’m now being labeled as rude, overdramatic and disrespectful.Id also like to add that my brother (21M) is not subjected to the same treatment. He was even out at a restaurant (with his friends i assume) while this happened.So AITA for asking to be warned when guests are over? was i really being disrespectful?",

	"body" : "Okay so little backstory - me (23f) and my gf (26f) have been together for a little over 2 years. We'll call her Lilah.Ever since I was a baby, my mom and dad always taught me to never let someone borrow my clothes especially shoes and hats, because our culture believes that one carries their essence and spirit in their clothes. Maybe that sounds like bullshit? Idk but it's how I was raised and that one aspect has stuck with me through the years...aaand I grew up with brothers taking my shirts and stretching them to wear, so I hate feeling like a sibling to whoever I'm dating when they do similar. When I occasionally borrow my best friend's or partner's clothes, I make sure to ask first and let them know my background and that I'd prefer for them to ask as well.Here's the issue.When I met Lilah, she was used to just borrowing her ex's clothes all the time without asking. She also grew up with siblings, but she was used to them taking her stuff to wear and vice versa. The first time we realized that we had different views on this was pretty early on in the relationship.About a few months in, I was running an errand with my bestfriend and I left Lilah at my apartment until we came back. While we were out, Lilah sent me a pic of her wearing my wig, leggings, shirt, and shoes. Like head to toe decked out.We talked about it after and I told her I don't like it and explained the culture and sibling thing. She let me know that she just wanted to feel pretty because she's been really down lately (she dresses more masculine and I'm feminine). I was still kind of annoyed but let her know she's still beautiful and asked her not to do it again.Our whole relationship, this has been a constant back and forth issue btwn me and Lilah: Lilah taking/wearing my things without asking, me mentioning I don't like it, her saying she just won't wear my things anymore because she'll forget to ask. Rinse and repeat. We're a pretty chill couple, so outside of the obvious boundaries like \"no name calling or downgrading\", this is one of 2 very specific ones I have with her.Today, she wore my cargos to her job and the only reason I knew was because I happened to facetime her to see the dogs and saw her wearing them. When she came home and I brought it up, she told me \"I knew it was gonna be an issue when I put them on, but I had to put them on anyway because I was rushing,\" and it made me so angry.I think I may be the asshole because when she said that, I told her that I felt like my feelings weren't respected or considered. She knew it was gonna cause an issue and still did it anyway. And that I feel like that line's crossed a lot and then backed up with excuses. We went back and forth for a bit and she told me that I make her feel like she intentionally disrespects me when its not a big deal because she was rushing.This is only my 2nd relationship and idk what's normal, so am I making it a bigger deal than it needs to be?",

I've always chosen the cheapest items on the menu because I know that my dad works hard and I feel terrible everytime I hear the total cost of our meals at the end of the night.One evening, my sister and I decided that we wanted to pay our parts in our dinners since we now are young adults with jobs and discussed this with our dad. He was completely fine with it and was happy that we were taking a step up in being adults and offering to pay most of the bill. While seated at our table, I'm browsing the menu and our waitress does the usual routine. When she gets to my order, for a second I forgot I was paying for my bill and started panicking because what I wanted was kinda pricey but then remembered I was paying and said \"oh wait, it doesnt matter what I order, I'm paying for myself anyways haha\" to my dad and then placed my order. Keep in mind that the restaurant we were at was really busy and loud. I dont think I said it loud enough for the waitress to hear and I highly doubt she did considering there was a loud table with kids right next to us. Either way, she didnt care or have a reaction since shes just there to do her job and she leaves.Right after she leaves, my dad looks at me and says \"why did you say that? you dont say that stuff at the table\" in a defensive tone. I was shocked at how he spoke to me because I didnt understand why he was mad and I asked him \"wait why is it bad? I just said that because I forgot I didnt need to worry about what im ordering\". I was genuinely lost and confused and he got defensive at the table. I apologized to him even if I couldn't understand why he got mad and I stayed quiet at the table for the next 5 minutes. For context, I have pretty bad anxiety and have a hard time coping when people get mad at me, especially if I dont know what I did wrong. So, what I learned growing up was to just stay quiet and move on from any situation where someone is yelling/mad at me. After the 5 minutes of me staying quiet, he continues to tell me how that was embarassing for him and that I hurt his feelings by saying that. (Reminder: we had a full discussion with my sister and him about how we were paying for our bills.) I apologize again and ask if we can just move on and talk about something else because it wasnt that deep and other people in the restaurant started looking at us since he was starting to raise his voice. He starts yelling at me in front of everyone at the restaurant and I just start crying from embarrassment and being overwhelmed and confused.

	"body" : "I (18M) am a trans man (FtM) and have been out and proud for years. I'm very lucky to have an accepting and supportive mom. My brothers on the other hand are pretty die-hard Christians and in turn are homophobic. I knew that, and already accepted they'd never accept me as who I am and will forever misgender and dead name me. I accepted it because they've been the best older brothers all my life, and I want them to continue to be a part of my life.Now an issue has arisen and I'm so torn and it's stressing me out. Both of my brothers are getting married to my two future SIL's in the same year, one in spring and one in fall.  My SIL's are the same in terms of being a die-hard christian and in turn homophobic, but thankfully they nor my brothers have ever said anything rude/offensive directly to me. My brother that's getting married in the spring, his fiancé came to me and asked me to be one of her bridesmaids. Not long after, my other SIL asked me the same thing, but she acknowledge me being trans for once, and gave me an option. Either I agree to be one of her bridesmaids and unfortunately wear a dress and be forced to be the girl I'm not, or simply not be in the wedding party and then can show up in slacks and dress shirt.Neither pressured me into answering right away, and I still haven't but I'm so stressed on what to do. Here's the explanation for my likely confusing title. I'm thinking that if I deny to be a bridesmaid just so I can be myself and not uncomfortable and hating every moment, that I'd be the asshole to both my brothers and their fiancé's for not being in their wedding party when they asked me to be. But then, would I be the asshole to myself if I agree to be their bridesmaid and force myself to be someone I'm not, and forever remember the weddings as miserable as I wear a dress and makeup, being misgendered by everyone and forever being framed and posted as such forever? Am I just the asshole no matter what I choose?I've cried over this several times and I can't come to a decision. I'd love more than anything to be in my brothers' weddings, but on their side. So not being in the wedding at all would hurt me so much, but at the same time I hate the idea of forcing myself to be someone I'm not just to appease them... What should I do? I don't think there's any alternate choice so which would be less asshole-ish?Ending Note: I wrote this in present tense, but this actually happened a while ago and the weddings are said and done. I'm just curious what others think I should have done and which option would be less of an asshole move. I'll update this post later on about the decision I ended up making and how it went over. Thank yall!Edit: I was abt to update this but more comments have started rolling in so I'll wait a bit, but I won't have room to make the update on this post so it'll have to be a separate one unfortunately. I suppose if you're interested in the outcome, watch out for an update post later today <3",

She said she was on a budget but I told her nice furniture stores have a cheaper section so she can get a better deal there. We ended up going to havertys and she didn’t see anything she liked. I on the other hand did and fell in love with this dining room set and decided to buy it. I asked if she wanted to go anywhere else and she said she was tired and just wanted to go home. I thought all was good but she sent me a nasty text today saying it was incredibly disrespectful for me to buy a $3k table when her budget was $400 and put down the other stores as having junk. I wasn’t aware her budget was so low, when we were looking she never specified a price range. I apologized for offending her but I feel she’s overreacting especially since she didn’t tell me her budget. AITA here?",

My grandma had passed earlier in the year and my mom was kind of depressed. With that being said I still made sure I asked if my mom wanted to do anything for Christmas. My mom told me no she wasn't in the Christmas spirit. I understood this and didn't press.So my girlfriend who I had met in July was going on vacation with her family on Christmas Day. She was being overly emotional but I tried make her feel at ease. She wanted to see me Christmas Eve and I told her I would free up my schedule for her.My mom got a change and decided FAMILY FIRST! to which my mom said she wanted to spend time with me on Christmas Eve. I said to her Christmas Eve was filled can we do Christmas. She said I could come home with her but id have to get myself back. They was fine except my mom lived really far and  Christmas was a Sunday so no buses were going to take me home the day after Christmas my mom yelled at me that her needs were not met and if she feels like this again she'd consider cutting me offYeah I know right so let's fast forward 9 months to September 2023 it's Thursday night the eagles were playing the Vikings I had on my GIGANTIC headphones because I was talking to my girlfriend and I was on indeed looking for a job. My mom came into the living room and starts talking to me about her best friend. How she was not in alignment with a lot of her choices. My mom was just completely ignoring my set up. Yet I tried to put in my 2 cents when needed. But I couldn't keep up with her questions and story. So me Mom says to me you're being rude. I told her that I was doing stuff, and that's when She then stormed off.The next day I spoke with my mom about what happened I told her that it wasn't okay for her to demand I give her time when I'm in the middle of something. She told me if it were my girlfriend I would have made time for her. I explained that I was in the middle of something and you were emotionally dumping on me (something that she had done my whole life) that is she needed me she could just ask me if I was free to talk so I could give her my attention. My mom told me that she REFUSES TO DO THAT BECAUSE SHE'S SICK OF ME NOT BEING AVAILABLE FOR HER!!!! my mom then said fine I won't talk to you at all. I asked my mom which one of us is the parent and she needed to grow up am I the asshole?",

I have always known that she has a few screws loose and for that reason I do not drink with her at the bars or really talk to her outside of living in the same house because I believe she is a truly ugly person on the inside. Last semester she dated a guy who I had physical evidence that he cheated on her and we both knew he just wanted to physical intimacy with her. When they did and he told his friends what they did (like boys do) she told everyone that he did it wrongfully. Over the holiday break she got too drunk at a bar with her parents and snapped. She got in a fight with her mom and screamed at random people in the bar. She was arrested but now her family is getting it expunged (they're loaded $$). I should state that she is an only child and perfect in her parent's eyes. This last week her mother has been at our house 24/7 just sitting on the couch watching tv all day and drinking wine. When I got home the other night I was tired and wanted to be left alone. I went into my room but before I did her mom begged me to hang out with them. When I said no and went into my room she chased me and screamed through the door and hitting it saying that I am a terrible person for not calling her daughter to check on her over break. Since her daughter has screamed at me before for being concerned about her (when I told her I found her \"boyfriend\" on tinder) | never called her as I was told to keep it confidential. Most of the fight was her screaming at me because they \"Aren't bad people!\". I moved all of my things out of the house immediately the next morning while they were gone because I'm genuinely afraid for my safety since they have made comments about \"getting rid of people who wrong them”So, am I the asshole for not calling after she got arrested even though we aren’t friends?",

	"title" : "AITA For Saying My Brother Was Acting Like A Crybaby?",
	"body" : "My brother (28M) and I (26NB) live together with our parent. I do most of the housework, including cooking meals. Two days ago my brother said he wanted to cook, and we were cool with that. He just had to clean up after himself and wash the dishes. We have a dishwasher, so he would just have to use that.He cooked yesterday, and that's where the first issue came up. Because of the way our kitchen is set up I put the dish soap and the dishwasher detergent next to each other on the counter. While he finished making the meal and cleaning up messaged me a bunch of questions, like if the chicken he cooked was still raw, where to put the dish detergent in the dishwasher, what button to press to start the dishwasher.At a certain point I just get up and directly show him what to do. The dishwasher starts running, and things seem to be going smoothly. That is until soap suds start pooling out of the washer on to the floor. He put dish soap into the dishwasher instead of detergent.I brought it up with him, and, though I was admittingly frustrated, I tried to stay calm. I didn't raise my voice, no ad hominem attacks, using my \"I\" statements and all that. He said he used the wrong solution because the dish soap didn't have a label. But it did, and so did the dish detergent. He ended up leaving before I could do more than bring up the issue and ask him to clean up the mess it made, which he later just threw a towel on.This morning I was going to do dishes when I saw how he organized the dishwasher. One of the pans was placed face up, so it collected a gallon or so of water. I tried taking it out without spilling, but of course it did. I was frustrated, and started swearing to myself about how \"isn't it common sense to put it face down.\" That's when my brother came in to ask what was up. Now I was frustrated, but I was really trying not to be aggressive or yell or anything. I had to take a deep breath, which could have come off as a snarky sigh tbh.Me: In the future put the pans facing down otherwise it collects water and-He cut me off, and I can't remember what he said verbatim. It was something like \"what do you want me to do about it now\" and like.. man, I was steaming, but I tried just continuing to explain why you have to put the pot face down, but he started walking away downstairs.Him: I'm sorry. I do everything wrong. Me: Don't start pulling that crybaby self pity- Him: I'm not. I know I did it wrong.He ended up just leaving and going out to shovel snow, and I know he tends to do physical activity when he's mad. I get taking space when one is angry so they don't say/do something they regret, but it feels like this always happens. He does something, I try to talk to him about it, he gets defensive and runs off. Now I'm just sitting here mixed with frustration and guilt. Am I the asshole here?",

	"body" : "(19y/o) It happens almost everyday. I'm just chilling in my room. Usually after dinner. Most of the time I have headphones in, I'm listening to music, doing whatever. Then my mom comes in for something insignificant. Maybe to hand me some laundry she did (which I'm very thankful for that she does it for me) or just to check if I'm asleep or to say good night. Sounds very kind so far.The problem is, every time I get a huge shock because I don't hear her entering. And every time, I tell her that it's because of the music I'm listening to on my headphones that I don't hear her come in, and that I would like her not to do it anymore. She can text me if she wants something, as it's really probable that on my phone when I'm chilling in my room. I just happen to like listening to music on my headphones, so I won't hear her knocking at the door. (Even if I do hear her knocking, it's not like she waits for a reply, she's more like: \"I knocked three times and you didn't say anything so I came in!\")She keeps doing this and I keep telling her that I don't like it. She doesn't like it when I want to choose things like that. When I was small, she wouldnt even let me close the doors to my room all the way shut. Which I get, for safety reasons maybe. But even a small child should get the space to be truly alone and in private for some time, especially  if the child wants it.She tells me that I have a \"problem\", that I should take my \"stupid\" headphones out, or that I should \"grow up\". Now I'm thinking about locking the door every time I don't want to be bothered or surprised out of nowhere, because she keeps not accepting it.You guys think that that'd be too much?(edit: added my age)",

	"title" : "WIBTA If I go to a music festival but tell my cousin that I’m not going",
	"body" : "My cousin and I have been going to the same music festival for several years now as a sort of tradition. The first few years were a blast but the last two years were less than fun.The tickets are pretty expensive so for me to justify the price, I like to be there from the very first song to the very last one. I also like to try to see as many bands as I can versus seeing them from the best view, so I’m not always willing to skip someone to get closer To the stage for someone else. My cousin has always had no problem with going along with my little rules (which I’m willing to break if it makes sense).The issue with the last two years was that we started going with his friends. I like his friends but they don’t really go along with my preferences above. We showed up late the last two years which was fine because I didn’t really miss anyone.But we’ve also missed some smaller acts who I would’ve liked to see but we didn’t because they wanted to be center front stage for the next band at a different stage. I don’t mind watching someone by myself but my cousin feels bad if i go off on my own. However, I also know he wants to go along with what his friends are doing so I don’t try to separate from them.Then last year we missed the end of the night headliners because one of them started feeling sick and I had driven everyone in so I needed to leave to get them home. I was pretty upset about this one because the headliners concert tickets are crazy expensive regularly and basically this was my best chance of seeing them live.This year my cousin has already talked about us going with his friends again but honestly I just want to go for the music, even if it’s by myself. I feel like it would be really mean to say I’m only going if we don’t go with his friends, so the only other thing I can think of is saying I can’t go this year and just go by myself and hopefully not run into any of them. Would I be the asshole if I did this?Edit: It probably won’t change anyone’s mind but I don’t think I was very clear about why I would rather avoid talking about this with my cousin. You see while the last two years weren’t as good for me, I can tell that they were really fun for my cousin. My cousin is really nice and if I were to tell him that id rather not go with his friends, I know he would automatically say he has no problem with not going with them (even though he’s clearly excited about it). But if I tell him I’m just going to go by myself he would also feel bad about that. I know lying is wrong but either way I just think my cousin would end up upset, which is what I’m trying to avoid.UPDATE: Since the overwhelming response was that it would be an asshole move, I decided I would tell him the truth... it didn’t go as well as I would’ve liked. When I got home from work there were already plans being discussed in a group chat so I thought it would be best to let him know how I felt. Basically I adlibbed some of the script that was written in the comments. I told my cousin that I love going to the music festival with him and I do like his friends but I don’t like going to the music festival as a group with them. I let him know that I was a little disappointed the past few years because of what I said above. And because he seemed to have so much fun with his friends, I thought that maybe the best thing would be that I go there by myself and I can meet up with him and his friends throughout the day so that we can all enjoy the festival the way we like.I knew he would be a little bummed about it but I figured he would be okay with it since he would still be seeing me but also still get to hang out with his friends all day. However, instead he got really upset; he said that it felt like I was making him choose between me or his friends. I tried to explain that I was hoping to still hang out with everyone even though I was planning on going on my own schedule. That didn’t really work because he said “even so, I feel like you’re trying to abandon me”.  I felt really crappy after the phone call. My cousin is really upset about the whole thing and i feel like a giant jerk.But judging by how upset he is by the truth, I’m sure if I did what I had wanted to do and he found out it would’ve gone even worse. So basically I avoided the asshole move and still ended up being an asshole.",

	"body" : "I (FtM 19) got in an altercation with a family member (M 53) that all started with cleaning. I'll call the family member \"Jeff.\"I was asked to clean up my bathroom, which I did except for my shower/tub which had draining issues and needed to be fixed. Jeff texted me asking if I had cleaned yet, which I had been over the past 2 days.I had responded hours late as I was about to work and apologized, saying I don't look at my phone all the time. I had put my phone on mute to focus as I work from home, and that's when hell broke loose.For context, we live in the same house. From death in the family, I was left inheritance and the current house in my name. Working through all the mess and legal mambo is still ongoing and was put on hold as I was going through some other personal issues.We do not have a good relationship at all, as it is very toxic and verbally abusive, and he (in my opinion) shows narcissistic traits. Because I have the house in my name, he's been asking for me to add him to the title so he can feel safer, as he fears an event where I ask him to leave the property, no longer having a place to stay.During the time I wasn't looking at my phone, Jeff sent paragraphs of not feeling disrespected by late replies, berating me in text and saying he will ignore me because of me responding late. I didn't respond to that until the next day and told him I answered him back and apologized.I said further that late responses to text aren't disrespecting, and him stating he will ignore me is the behavior of a child. My response ended with stating it is not my job to regulate his emotions, and I believe he needs to seek mental help for his history of outbursts and anger targeted at me.After sending the text, Jeff comes banging at my door, demanding an explanation of my text in frustration. He said I have zero respect for him, only care about myself, am an asshole for not getting him any gifts for his bday or holidays (I had no money and was a minor for the majority of the time we've lived together), would be worth nothing more than someone else's object of pleasure and to be taken advantage of.He tied his rant back to cleaning, and claimed I did nothing, as there were a few spots missing and some leftover dust in a hard-to-reach corner of my bathroom. I ask Jeff to stop yelling, he tells me to get over myself. He says I am an asshole because I don't care for him in the way he wants to be cared for and treat him like his mother did, referencing financial abuse between the two of them.As for context on the financial part, Jeff was receiving a fixed payment from my inheritance until I turned 18. The payments stopped after I graduated from high school. Jeff was upset the payments stopped, and blamed me for it happening, when that's part of the law. He claimed he had planned using said payments for several years ahead until I turned 25, and had been going into debt knowing he had the payments to rely on.So, am I the asshole?",

My boyfriend (28 M: let’s call him James) and I have been living together for almost a year, and been together for 2 . I recently worked a stretch of 3 nights, with one night off, followed by another 4 nights. To say I’m exhausted is an understatement. James works a typically 9-5 office job and has a fair amount of free time in the evenings. I’ll admit I’m not always the cleanest person and often leave clothes everywhere, don’t always do my dishes immediately, and just generally forget to pick things up. When I’m not working a stretch, I try to be a lot more conscious of this and do my best to pick up the house more. When I am working a stretch, however, this all sort of goes out the window- and it’s nothing crazy, just maybe forgetting to put a few things away or leaving dishes in the sink. My issue is that when I come home from work and I’m mentally, physically and emotionally drained- the house is a mess. Everything is exactly how I left it, but with the addition of his dishes in the sink and his stuff laying around. Coming home to a messy house is really stressful to me. I understand that my mess is my own problem, and I’m not expecting him to necessarily clean up after me- just to make a little more of an effort to clean when he knows I’m working a lot. I tried talking to him about it by just mentioning how much I’d appreciate it if he cleaned one day while I was asleep before working another shift. He was fully taken aback and responded with “sure I guess….” Followed by “well you didn’t clean this past week when you weren’t working, so I’m just confused why you expect me to clean.” For the record, I hadn’t cleaned that week, but my childhood pet had passed away at the beginning of the week and I was feeling really down.TLDR: am I the asshole for wanting my boyfriend to clean up a little more when I’m working a stretch of night shifts?",

My other friend let’s call her Isla, planned her graduation party for July the 15th.

I felt really bad and missed my friend,  so i texted him and told him i would TRY be in attendance after Isla’s graduation party and his attitude towards me completely changes. The rest of the week goes by fine. On july 1st, his actual bday K and I went out to dinner and went back to his house to drink and celebrate with other mutual friends. We had cake and a bought him a nice bottle of wine as a gift!Fast forward to the 15th, I go to Isla’s graduation party at 6 and plan to leave to go to K’s birthday party at 9. However, I lost track of the time and ended up getting a little drunk. So i texted K that I would stay at isla’s because I haven’t seen her in a long time, and I was too drunk to drive. K’s party, ended up being a sleepover with our mutual friends.  so i told him that i would stop by in the morning and then we could grab breakfast as a group because i still wanted to celebrate him.But, i get texts from K and other mutual friends saying tht I am a bad friend and cursing me out for not showing up and it made me cry. I didn’t think i was  a bad friend and explained that i was there on his actual bday to celebrate so i didn’t see how i was a bad friend.. plus i told him that i would TRY to make it after isla’s birthday party.

Also, K is really well off and apparently his party had a lot of stuff including a mechinal bull and taco truck, so a part of me thinks he wanted to show off? He has a habit of making me and other mutual friends feel bad because we aren’t as well off as him. 2/3 mutuals who were also at K’s party cut him off recently because of shitty behavior towards them.

Ill ask her if she wants to go out to an event like ice skating or shopping (it's never stressful events like clubbing or going to bars) and half of the time she refuses citing her dissociation as a reason. It has gotten to the point of obscurity. She will use it as a reason to escape everything.When I mention that she should seek treatment for it she dismisses me saying that she tried one drug and it didn't work for her so she doesn't want to do it again. She goes to a homeopathic doctor and they prescribed her a BS medication that doesn't even work and she admits that it doesn't really work either but that I should \"play along with it\" because, in short, the placebo effect makes her feel better. This is a major issue in her life as she describes it to me and it is becoming increasingly my issue as well.When we go out, and she suggests that we should go to a party or drink, every single time without fail she will get too drunk and say that she starts dissociating and I should take her home. This ruins my entire night because instead of having fun I have to take care of her. The next day she promises me she will NEVER drink again. However, after a little while passes, she will suggest drinking again and when I point out that it's a trigger for her dissociation, she always brushes it off saying that it \"wasn't the drinking that caused it, rather it was XYZ...\".I also personally have issues with dissociation but I don't make it the problem of everyone around me. I try to get out of my comfort zone and battle it so I can get over it. She keeps staying in her safe zone, and it's becoming a smaller and smaller safe zone where she basically refuses to do anything anymore.It has really gotten to me these past few months and I don't think I can just shut up and go along with it anymore. Would I be the asshole if I confronted her and said this to her, saying that she should find actual ways to solve it instead of just making it everyone's problem?",

He’s recently just connected with my father and step mom over 3 months ago as we just moved back to where my dad lives. So last night at dinner my stepmom asked us “did you guys have work today?” I said no, my partner said no, and then I mentioned that my bf hadn’t gone to work yesterday due to the cold. My stepmom agreed it was a good decision. Later my bf tells me that I shouldn’t bring him up in conversation because it is common courtesy. I could very well be in the wrong here and I am just looking for someone to try and explain in detail how, as the conversation we had with my stepmom did not include very personal or sensitive information.

We don't know what to do. We are starting to think we should leave him. He has been rude and has always had an attitude when we speak Spanish around him. He's also disregarded the solutions we have given him. We know he has been going through some things but still it isn't an opportunity to be a bitch to us and we don't know what to do, he is always ignoring our suggestions (learning the language, telling us he is either uncomfortable or feel left out etc.) and doesn't communicate his concerns with us.

I say some words in spanish like que for example, but my friend (14) has always translated and / or responded in english. I (13) like speaking Spanish with my friend even if it's in little sentences or words. I always apologize for speaking Spanish around snake, Snake has always said it's okay, so I always thought it would have been okay to let a few spanish words slip out. I don't have a full convo in spanish with my friend who also speaks spanish, I always try to keep it to a minimum and to keep it English. And to add on to what my friend said, we have tried to get him to learn spanish and have taught him a few words but he says that 'it's too hard' and that there's 'no point'.

Im already tired(it was about 8:30pm)he said yes. We get to the bar, we're having fun w/e&then H says shots? so we all do shots. R knows I don't like him do Jameson around me bc every time he has hes gotten EXTREMELY mean to me. He knows that so he doesn't drink it anymore. H says Tullamore dew(fine) , then switches his to Jameson and R said yea I'll just do Jameson too &I straight up told him if he takes the shot of Jameson then I'm going home. Then H was like \"oh stop\" & R still took the shot. I honestly should've left right then but I drove him&didn't want to ruin the night despite how bothered I was from it. So after that, I got in to a bad mood. I wasn't rude or anything I was just more quiet. Mind you, I'm more of an introvert to begin with. We continue to hang out&I was trying to show I wasn't 100% mad by having D put his hand on my leg or putting my legs on his while we sat at the bar. Note: when he drinks heavily, I try to stay quiet so I can't say anything to upset him so he doesn't have a reason to freak out,get mad&fight. He ended up inviting them back to the house (I didn't care I'm down to hang out) but its a common theme that when we hang out with these friends, he ALWAYS over drinks&becomes incoherent&gets agitated easily. I was just chilling on the couch with everyone, having a good time, relaxing. H suggests shots again. R's already slurring his words bc he's real drunk. So he tried telling me to get the shots&I was like no way (didn't say it nastily but I don't like when he over drinks so I'm not going to be part of him doing more shots.) W needed another beer, so I got up, went to take the shot glasses to clean them for them&got W a beer.H was like I'm not done with this so I was like ok I was trying to be nice&clean them. R made a smart comment with an attitude \"oh yeah you're just so nice thanks\" so at this point I took my phone&said I was going to lay down (so that I could walk away for a few to calm down bc that upset me.) it was sarcastic&rude, not sarcastic&funny. that made him LIVID. He started freaking out on me&I just kept saying I was walking away so we didn't argue bc I was upset about the comment&didn't want to fight about it. Then he started claiming I was calling him stupid&an ahole&a piece of shit (none of that happened)&he then kicked me out, at 2:30am during a HORRIBLE rain storm. I had to take all my shit&my cat, drive 25 minutes home, in conditions you could barely see out the windshield in. All bc I tried to walk away to avoid the situation from escalating into an argument, bc I knew the comment upset me.

	"body" : "Hi, first time posterMy partner and I have three young children, twins 3 years old and a 5 year old. After putting them to bed, we made a plan to wake up at 6am and do some focused cleaning between 6am-8am before the children woke up. I woke up at 6am and tried to wake him up, so I waited and tried again at 6.30am. I then spent the next hour and half trying to wake him up gently, by speaking to him, telling him we made a plan it's time to wake up, as well as playing his favourite wake up alarm song at times.Everytime I was met with, go the fuck away, shoush, be quite, I don't care, you get up and clean, fuck off, be quiet, shut up, etc.At 8am, I decided enough is enough and I exited the bedroom and got in the shower as the situation was making me anxious and I thought best to exit it and come back in a bit.In that timeframe, my children woke up and came to me, they were asking where daddy is and that it's time to wake up as it's sunshine outside. So then we went back in and asked him to wake up, I heard the same things again and I said: we are a team, \"I am waking you up as we made a plan to make our day better and we have plans that we have to follow through with today, I'm not upset with you, we are working together to get the things done we have to do and it's okay we can start now and feel good about it. This is the plan we made as a team, so I'm honoring it by waking you up, which you asked me to do\". (This is what I was saying when trying to wake him before, but in a shorter version to try and remind him why im waking him up etc). I also said I'm going to take off the bed covers, which you approved as a method to wake you up before. Before going to bed, I asked what I could do to wake him up, to help him wake him up, as it has been something he has been struggling to do.When I went back in after the children were awake, he told me to leave him alone and that he is leaving, to go back to my day, clean and look after the kids. Bcs when he wakes up he is leaving. I thought well he is saying this out tired, as he has said mean things in the past  and then not remembered them later/then apologised. I asked him if he meant it, and then he opened his eyes looked at me and said I'm leaving now shush and let me be.So now, it's clear that he has kind of been awake and semi-aware of the things he is saying. I'm still in the mindset, I'm here to help, let's work as a team and move forward. But now I'm thinking perhaps I'm the asshole for trying to wake him up but I was only waking him up, bcs of the plan we made together in order to have a good day today.",

It has been a while since me and A hanged alone without B so I was excited. Do not get me wrong, B is like a best friend to me but sometimes I just miss hanging out with A like we did before they got together. Before I felt like I'm thirdwheeling wherever we were..A few days later I have learned that B will go shopping with us.. I was slightly annoyed but soon was like \"Eh, the more the merrier ig.\"The day of hanging out came and I was slightly sick so I considered going home instead but since we make plans very rarely, I have decided to stay. I have waited for about 2 hours for A and B to finish their classes.After we finally left school, we made a slight detour through a grocery store. Throughout the entire thing they would chat, flirt, smirk at each other and while I didn't care as much the feeling that im thirdwheeling was starting to get to me. Then as I was picking one more thing they left. They forgot me at the shop. At some point I silently caught up to them and continued onwards about a meter behind them. This was due to the chilly air and the fact that I did not want to inhale too much of it by going too fast and catching my breath.Then, however I overheard them talking about one more stop (L) before our target shop.. Thing I have not mentioned in this post yet. I had about 2 hours. I had to BE home at 8 due to other thing that I had to attend. And it was already 6:30 and bus ride home was about 20 minutes from the shop we were aiming for.So after the silent walk behind them, before a cross road I asked whether they are going to L.A looked at me and confidently said \"Me and B wanted to go to S. Wanna come?\" I looked them in the eyes, turned and left.It may not sound like much but this is the best translation from my language I could do. Basically why I left was because they clearly forgot that we made that plan initially together and also I just waited for 2 hours just to go with them and yeah.. I just kind of felt hirt I guess..This may be where I am a jealous asshole because I am reading into it a lot but I just.. the entire walk I was not once invited into the conversation, I got forgotten in the grocery store and now this..

However he blames it on it being hard to apply to and I disagree. The websites have application portals and are in English. When I applied and attended university in his country nothing was in English and I managed to get into a prestigious university nevertheless.Another issue is that he only wants to apply to prestigious universities, which I would support if that was actually realistic, because he went to university in the US.

I bang on the door because one of my roommates is home but she’s asleep. after what seems like a good amount of time banging on the door in 28 degree weather i call my other roommate who is staying at her gfs house (5 mins away). she declines my call and then texts me saying “yes”. i ask her to come home nd unlock the door bc i’m locked out and it’s freezing outside, she then tells me that she is asleep and that i should use the back door (1). Which I reiterate I can’t bc I don’t have my keys & I’m really cold. I’m still actively banging on the door. And then she asks me if i can come grab a key from her?? Obviously no. Next she says something like “this sleep is really important for my brain rn and ive been locked out of the house” I tell her that that’s really fucked up and that she’s selfish. thankfully my other roommate who was sleeping finally let’s me in. while i’m at work she doesn’t respond for a few hours and says that she didn’t want to let me in because “i’ve been outside for just as long and that you wouldn’t have done the same thing for me.and it probably would’ve taken an hour” (2) and that she’s just overall been “frustrated because i’ve been HEARING that kooty (my cat) is peeing everywhere and being shut out of your room. and that I have no empathy.” after that I said i’m not going to argue with her over the phone once again and i’ll talk to her when i get home and then i blocked her. Now for the explanations, which is more like background informationshe broke through our front door resulting in the locks needing to be changed. Her key doesn’t work. However, because she broke our door and her key doesn’t work she expects me and the other roommate to unlock the door for her every time even though she can still enter through the back which would take literally 10 secs to walk to. But she refuses to do that and before this incident she spammed our phones for us to unlock the the front door which i didn’t see bc I wasn’t by my phone. Now it seems she’s upset with only me because I didn’t let her in. She claims this is her being “locked out”This one blew my mind. I have driven her so many places when her car fucks up. I’ve taken her to and from bars, gfs house, work. Drove her to several different doctors offices and cvs’ when she was sick. I never asked for anything nor did i really expect anything in return. Her saying it would probably take me an hour to pick her up was from the time she asked me to pick her up from her gfs house because she didn’t want to uber ($5) while I literally had the flu and felt like death. She told me i could take my time then proceeded to rush me. One time she wanted me to sit in the car with soaking wet pants because i stepped in a puddle in the middle of winter so she could go into kroger. I feel this is really spiteful punishment",

Even though I moved most of my very close friends still attend my old school and I have had quite a hard time socialising in my new school. Despite this I feel like we have done a good job of maintaining a good friendship and I am still part of their friendship group.However recently, a series of events played out it in this order: It's almost the end of the holidays and I haven't seen any of my friends in a while so I ask each of my 3 closest friends if they are free and they all tell me no they are busy, without context. It gets later in the day and I get online onto a videogame. One of the friends I asked is online. It turns out he is meeting one of the other friends I asked, but I just assume he can only accommodate one person or whatever. Because the other friend doesn't play many videogames, the three of us have a good time for a while messing about when all of a sudden my friend goes silent. I ask the other friend on text what happened, he says that the mic wont unmute and he refuses when i ask to call. A few minutes of silent gameplay go by when all of a sudden my friend unmutes for a second to say \"his sister will be playing\" which is a blatant lie as his sister doesnt ever play the game. I eventually just quit the game out of upset. At the moment i am in a very rough point of my life because of my parents divorce and often feel extremely lonely. After i quit the game I broke down crying.The next day the friend is once again online, and i join him in game. When I ask him what happened he is extremely hesitant to tell me but he eventually does. All three of the friends had made plans and stayed at his house. At the point that he muted, the third friend arrived. According to him, they didnt tell me because they didnt want to hurt my feelings and they were muted because they were talking about something i wasnt allowed to know about - which is crazy for me, because I rarely hide anything from them, being my closest friends.Earlier today I was playing the game again but with different friends i met very recently. My friend asked to join the party but this time I denied it out of anger. When I did, he started insulting me in our groupchat. Throughout this me and the new friends only laughed and teamed up on him, acting toxicly, only making his insults worse. He even brought up things like my parents loving me, calling me gay and autistic etc.He has since apologised but I have not responded - was i wrong for ganging up on him?TL:DR my friends all met up without me then lied to me about it.

Recently I asked him to order some new things. A new mattress (King size because we have ALL been sleeping on a Queen), along with a bedframe, sheets, & comforter. Reason for this is because we needed a bigger bed. I had picked EVERYTHING out on Amazon, and I even took one of my paychecks and used it to help us get the new mattress and he said he'd get everything else, despite me making mention that I'd also pay for the bedframe, however, he was INSISTENT on paying for everything else. So I let him. Well when the mattress got here I did notice it being a little different than the link I sent him, and a couple hours later realised that the mattress was a different brand & model and was more firm than what I had asked him fo order. Ontop of he ordered the wrong sheets (granted he thought he was getting the right ones), and then he ordered the wrong comforter, and then come to find out later he ordered the wrong bedframe. Now I'm not unreasonable, so after I took a walk to cool off and think logically, I told him I'll look at the bedframe when it gets here (this was before I noticed the mattress being different), and told him that if his wife & I felt it was unsafe or wasn't a decent one, we'd just send it back, and I'll buy the correct bedframe, meaning if I approved of it, then it could stay & no harm, no fowl. And the sheets & comforter are super easy to fix! So small stuff I won't generally sweat. But the VERY THING I paid for so we could ALL benefit from it wasn't the right thing at all, and now we're stuck with a king size mattress thats the wrong plushiness. I feel SUPER guilty about even being upset over it because on one hand there are PLENTY of people who WISH that they even had a mattress to sleep on, but I can't help but feel SUPER upset & disappointed it's not the one I picked out. Side note: I also picked out specific sheets & a specific comforter because my boyfriend does overheat easily, and so the comforter I chose is light weight, and I opted for Satin Sheets as they are supposed to be cooler. The mattress I wanted is supposed to be gel memory foam. I don't want to sound ungrateful or entitled or anything like that. But the biggest issue at this point is the mattress. AITA for wanting him to fix the mattress issue? I haven't talked to him about it yet and I want some opinions before I do talk to him.",

So, of course I was excited, my family rarely ever got to go out to hotels ever, and it was a pretty nice place, it costed about $100 something dollars for one night, it had a jetted tub in the room, and a separate area with a fold out couch (futon) and a tv, like a little living room space, and was quite nice. Before we even went, I asked him, none of your friends are supposed to be going with, right? (One of his friends booked the room for us and took us to the hotel, was booked for us bc credit score bs) He told me no, it’s just going to be a sibling night for him and me, and that it was my present and gift.Well, fast forward to a few hours later, we’re in the hotel, and he asks if his friend (which is also like his fwb guy) can come over for a little while to hang out. (Literally to hang out nothing else happened lmao) Reluctantly, I agreed to it. He wouldn’t be staying the night, so it wouldn’t end up being weird, I agreed to it, even though he said no one would be there with us.Fast forward another few hours, my brother says to me that his friend had a few too many drinks, and his house was a bit too far for him to be driving, so he’d be staying the night. At this point, I was beyond frustrated. I said to him “I thought you said no one was supposed to be with us, and it was just going to be a night for us to hang out?” Well, then he throws in my face that “he paid for the room, so I really shouldn’t be complaining”. I made him and his friend sleep on a futon that night, while I took the bed for myself. Am I the asshole?",

I tried to explain myself that i only meant it in the context that we all didnt have to be angry all night and to just chill out, that i didnt mean to hurt her feelings or “talk shit” and i even pointed out when she confronted me i told her to her face. I did apologize that it wasnt my intention to upset her but she just wasnt having it and kept verbally berating me. It then turned into a circular argument where she kept saying not talk talk “badly” about her in her own house and a list of other issues came up where I had to point out this isnt the only time shes gotten on me for something instead of putting herself in my shoes or letting me explain. During our argument she even kept trying to involve friend 2 into the semantics of what I had said specifically instead of listening to what my intentions were and letting me explain what I meant,and at that point i just gave up and said i was leaving.I wasn’t happy about having to drive after a night of drinking but i wasnt about to be stuck in her house with her yelling at me and “proving a point” over and over trying to make me out to be a horrible person that was out to get her. I honestly felt like she really was just looking to be angry that night and has had negative feelings toward me for some time now, and it was pretty upsetting that she wouldnt even let me apologize or explain my intentions or try see it from my side.I even text her that i loved her and i was sorry about upsetting her and reiterated that wasnt my intention but she completely ignored me and she didnt even bother seeing if I was okay getting home. At this point i feel like shes just kind of a bully who wants a bunch of yes people on her side and always has to have something to say about people doing something wrong, or at the very least her ego prevents her from ever putting herself in anyone elses shoes.AITA for saying she was “triggered” and trying to tell her other friend to calm down a bit so we could change the mood of our evening?edit: i can agree and see how the word itself may not have been appropriate, which is why i apologized and felt bad for it. I felt like not being allowed to apologize, having to be yelled at forever after, and made out to be malicious (which i wasnt)  toward her was very fair toward me.",

	"body" : "I 33f and my bf 33m both live in France and due to some issues with the company we work for, decided to get a roommate in order to be more financially secure. The first candidate was a Ukrainian refugee (46f) who was struggling to find an apartment. I empathized because I came to France as a foreigner and I struggled a lot financially and emotionally. She showed her finances and promised that she could pay the rent that I was asking.Well, that wasn’t entirely true, and I’ve since had to lower the rent for her. She doesn’t speak English or French, so we mostly communicate through DeepL. She was  in France for a year before she came to my apartment, and she got to have some free French courses  to help her get situated, but she wasn’t educated past high school in Ukraine, and trying to learn another language when she's not incredibly literate in her own, has been a challenge.There are a lot of social services that can help, but she is completely helpless to access them because she doesn’t speak/read French. Even if you are totally fluent in French, the stereotype about the administration here is as as bad as you’ve heard. Imagine that anytime you need anything from any kind of public office, it was the equivalent of having to go to the DMV. Awful.Anyways, my boyfriend and I have given her a ton of assistance to help her get situated. Teaching her how to read, setting up appointments with her, going to those appointments to make sure that things go smoothly.  The thing is, she just wants to go back to Ukraine, so she’s not putting a lot of effort into learning French. In fact, I will try to teach her words, and she will just repeat back the word in Ukrainian to me. That’s nice, but I don’t need to learn Ukrainian, and she really needs to learn French.I feel like she is not making enough effort to become more independent and stop needing me and my boyfriend all the time. She has now asked my boyfriend to write and send some emails for her. This is where I’m drawing the line. If she can use translation software to communicate with us, then I don’t see why she can’t use that to send an email.She’s very comfortable relying on us, even though she has a 17-year-old son who is staying with a host family in France, and is already pretty much fluent in French. I’m not familiar with Ukrainian culture at all, so I have no idea why she doesn’t rely on her son more for help, but I don’t want to start writing emails on top of everything else and becoming her personal secretary.Would I be the ahole if I told her to write her own emails? The translation services are not very good, so I have no control over whether the message comes across diplomatically or kindly or not, because at the end of the day, it’s the software that’s interpreting my words. I don’t want to create an awkward situation with somebody that I live with- but she’s asking for so much help that I’m starting to want her to just leave the apartment all together.

Now, I'm a good student and I take good notes, but I can't take good enough notes for when we only have 1 class the day before the test to learn about photosynthesis. And it's not \"light causes plants to grow\" photosynthesis, it's down to the chemical reactions and calvin cycle type of photosynthesis.We were told that because of the last minute teaching that it wouldn't be on test and because it's AP Bio that we need to know prior knowledge especially endosymbiosis and to really study that. So that is what I studied + some photosynthesis but that just brought up more questions and answers. The test was the complete opposite of what we were told, half of it was photosynthesis and things that weren't even touched on in class, and endosymbiosis wasn't even on the test!  It was also worded horribly and no one understood it. Me and two other very good students got our lowest grades ever.This isn't the first time that teacher has decided to not teach us certain things that would be important but it has never affected the classes grade.

	"body" : "I (19f) chose not to go to my family’s Christmas dinner and my family gave me flack for it. For context, my girlfriend (21f) of 3 years began going to each other’s holiday celebrations just last year. Last year, my gf came over Christmas Eve and stayed until 6:30pm, participating in my family’s Christmas morning and dinner, thus missing out on her family’s Christmas morning and dinner. We only got to spend an hour at my family’s dinner because her dad (who is bankrolling her college and she still lives under her parents’ roof rent free) wanted her to be at her grandma’s house to spend time with her family and so we left. This year, I work on Christmas in the ER. The job I do is essential to patient safety, and I am required to be vigilant and keep my mind sharp. This is where the problem arises. This year, I told my family I was going to go to my girlfriend’s Christmas and do their Christmas morning before work, since my girlfriend missed out on hers the year previous. My mom and dear brother (21m) were supportive of this and thought it was fair. My sister (29f) and eldest brother (31m) did not. They came over to my mom’s house for dinner a few weeks before Christmas. The conversation shifted to Christmas plans and I reiterated mine. So, my eldest brother told me “shut the fuck up and sit down because we could all gang up on you right now.” My EB is usually very vulgar but I was surprised by the aggression. I told him to do the same because I am an adult now and I can make my own decisions, as well as the fact that going to both christmases was unfair to my girlfriend and I needed to have time to sleep before work. Honestly I am a doormat so they were taken aback and it started a huge fight with them. They accused me of not caring about the family and that my girlfriend is a problem. They feel this way because of last year. It ended in me going to my room and crying, feeling hurt once again by my brother and sister, who were both in and out of my life constantly. When they were in my life, they treated me poorly and negatively impacted me. Afterwards I had a heart to heart with my mom who said that they are hurt about last year and they have a point but that they need to realize I am an adult. I spoke to my therapist about this as well as my girlfriend and they think that my siblings are trying to control me because they are insecure and they don’t realize that I am no longer a child that they can bully anymore. So, am I the asshole?",

	"title" : "WIBTA for Attending My Own Father's Funeral?",
	"body" : "A little background: I 25NB was raised by a single mother. She met my father after a messy divorce with her ex husband, and got pregnant. My father wanted to get married and have a child together, because he was afraid of the social ridicule he would endure by having a child out of wedlock. My mother pressed him to ask if he wanted to marry her for her or just because of the social pressure, and when he confessed it was the latter, my mother refused. My father gave her an ultimatum: him or the child. Well, given I am here to tell this story, I think you can guess what she chose.She moved across the country and started her life over as a single mother. But my father broke her heart. When I was young, she believed he would change his mind and come back for us, but he never did. To this day, my mother has never seriously dated anyone.I was a sickly child, and was in and out of the hospital for many years. Because of this, my mother went after my father for child support. It was court ordered he would have to pay 50% of my medical expenses until I was 18 (he never did), but because of this, my mother has, by court order, his active mailing address.My mother is a deeply petty person and holds grudges to a crazy degree. She knows my father is getting older, and was about 20 years older than her, so she believes he may not live much longer. Because of this, she went on a crazy deep dive on him. He doesn’t have social media, but with the court ordered information, and what she could use from data brokers and a DNA test she had me take “because we don’t know your father’s medical history”, she found out that he has a wife and two sons (whose names rhyme with mine?!?!), and that none of them know I exist.She came to me one day when we met up for lunch, with a huge binder of all the information she dug up on him and a plan. She found a way to get me on his life insurance through his work, so I can get an even split that would go to all his kids. But given her propensity for the dramatic, she decided we should crash his funeral. She wants me to make a whole speech about how he abandoned me, and how I finally found him after all these years, but I was just a moment too late. She wants me to make sure everyone in his life knows that he hurt my mom and abandoned me. It feels a bit cruel, especially because he won’t be the one punished, innocent people in his life would be, but it would destroy their memory of him. On the other hand, he broke my mother’s heart and did irreparable damage to her psyche, so maybe he deserves it?Other relevant info:My mother offered to fly me out, to, I guess surprise him at his house if I wanted to meet him? But given he now lives in Alabama and I would be unannounced, and my presence would undoubtedly cause drama, it feels dangerous. Plus I am happier not having a father to begin with, than meet him and have him reject me. That being said, making a scene before the funeral is probably out of the question.",

	"body" : "I (19enby) have been skiing with my mom (59F), dad (60M), and brothers (16M and 21M) for the past week at a resort. For the majority of the days, I have been skiing with my brothers since my dad previously injured his knee and my mom is a beginner, so they go on less intense trails. I have been pacing myself out throughout this week, while my brothers have not. Today, I wanted to ski from the tram line down to the bottom, but my brothers were tired and wanted a light day. Because of this, I asked my parents if I could go up to the tram line alone, and they refused due to the top of the tram being a black diamond run. I have skiied double blacks in the past, and I tried to tell them this, but they started to get upset and I eventually understood they were worried and didn't want me alone in case something happened.  Later on in the day, my family was extremely tired and decided to stick to skiing from one lift that exclusively services greens. By this point, however, I still had way too much energy. I asked if it would be alright for me to ski from another nearby lift instead, where the only trails currently open were blues or double blues. My brothers got extremely agitated with me, along with my dad, and berated me for not wanting to spend time with the family. I tried telling them that with the amount of energy I still have, I will be unable to get any restful sleep tonight. They said I NEED to ski with them, because I can't just ski alone. Their only reasoning was that it would be dangerous, despite the only servicable runs on that lift being blues and the fact I've been skiing since I was two. They said I would be unable to get any help should I get injured, which is untrue because this is a resort with ski patrol everywhere. By this point I was getting agitated and felt like they held zero confidence in my skills, so I argued a bit on their points. My brothers complained that they can't ski with me if I did go to that lift alone, and I told them that's their fault for not pacing themselves out this week and not avoiding having any \"easy\" or \"break\" days. My dad at this point snapped that I was ruining the family vacation on our very last day of skiing, which shut me up. My mom wasn't around for this and doesn't know, but I can't stop thinking about this. I kept on pushing for something my family didn't like and ended up ruining their mood. AITA?",

It’s genuinely annoying because she’ll make me out to be this horrible person just because I don’t speak at 1000 volume or scream while I’m on a rollercoaster.Again, it’s usually just her and some relatives that have an issue with my quiet behaviour. My friends and boyfriend have never had an issue with me.When I introduced her to my boyfriend she acted super obnoxious and couldn’t believe that I was dating someone at all. Mostly, she couldn’t believe I was dating a guy like him. (As in good looking with an active social life, she thought that if I ever did find a boyfriend, only weird incel-like ones would “tolerate” me).I got into a small fight with my boyfriend about something stupid, and was complaining to my mom about it. She had her phone on speaker and I knew that but what I didn’t know was that my sister was listening.  For context, my bf and I were fighting over him buying me the wrong brand of some product. We’re over it but I was just venting because I’ve been super stressed these past few days.She suddenly spoke up and said “well don’t you think you might be the problem?”I wanted to ignore her but I was in a bad mood so I asked her what she was trying to say and she started telling me about how it’s impossible to talk to me and I’m pretty much dead inside so my bf probably finds me impossible to talk to.I just sarcastically said “you’re funny” before trying to change the topic. But my sister said “it’s not a joke, I’m being serious. I know guys like him and just… don’t be surprised if he doesn’t want to deal with you anymore.”I got annoyed and told her that she should worry about her own relationships and how she’s been in like a billion but each one has barely lasted two months because none of them wanted to deal with her. She made a shocked noise before telling me that I suck and that I’m ugly on the outside and inside.My mom then interrupted and told me to apologize because my sister started crying and ran to her room. My sister is usually very strong and rarely cries so it’s a huge deal to my mom. I just got mad at my mom as well so I hung up. My mom and other siblings keep telling me to apologize and that she was only giving me some advice so I’ve been thinking about it.

	"body" : "Tonight, the family (me 23f, brothers 17+18, dad 62, mum 53) had a \"talk\" my dad initiated. After, he'd hand us our gifts.He didn’t like this year's Christmas not being as festive and we \"should've done more\". For me, the bad climate made me keep to myself. I also have a poor sleep schedule that I temporarily managed to regulate, but I've fallen off again to being up at 2-3pm. I'm struggling managing late diagnosed ADHD with little support from my parents who don't fully believe in it and think it can be \"prayed away\". That hasn't made me able to go to church this period and they commented nastily about it. It depressed me more and I stayed in my room. Brothers had their reasons.The overall frustration of the talk was that we, once again, made no progress. My mum contributed superficially. I spoke a lot and something my dad habitually does is misinterpret my words. For example, he's unhappy we don't go to church each Sunday. He insists that's the only way to be closer to God and our catholic obligation. I tried telling him that's not the only way to be closer to God and that some time away from the church doesn't mean we'd \"stray\" forever. Faith hasn't a single way to be built. He shouldn't force us to go, but give us the choice to. We kids'll find our way.For him, I said we want to stop going to church altogether.Because I disagree on a lot with him, he tells me not to \"influence\" my siblings, that I argue for arguing's sake. It hurts me how misunderstood I am as a person by both my parents even when I constantly try to explain my self to them. I also used to mediate a LOT!The main incident:Late night and our talk yielded zilch. Dad said we have to \"do our part\" to aid in \"familial harmony\" and gave us our gifts. Still kinda raw from our talk, I asked him to put mine aside, I'd take it later. He saw that as rude, my brothers insisted I take it, but I wanted to receive it in a calmer state of mind. I didn't say so at first though and took it reluctantly. Dad then said I constantly victimise myself. That's when I broke down in tears and explained my reason. My mother, who I and brothers say this to, since she has failed in the emotional aspects of being a mother and has yet to admit that, said that it was fine he said so to me since I say it to her which makes no sense given that it's true for her, but not for me. They told dad that was wrong to say to me and he said sorry, but I think he was dishonest.My brothers think my initial \"rejection\" of the gift was rude. Though they get my reason, I should still apologise. Later, they explained: When I told dad to put my gift down, he asked me why repeatedly and I just told him to put it down. (I don't remember him asking, because of what my dad said right after.) Since it took me a minute to say why, I should apologise for letting his misconception of my words get him agitated.AITA?",

	"body" : "I had a big year and wanted to celebrate by sending out a holiday card and a letter. In my letter, I wrote out some of the hobbies I'd been up to, work updates, and places I'd traveled to throughout the year. I included a section thanking people I saw throughout the year. When I saw people individually and on a recurrent basis, I named them, (\"thanks to Holly and Jack for weekly poker parties\") and when I saw people in groups, I thanked them (i.e., \"all my long-lost cousins at mom's retirement party, that was so much fun!\"). If I had listed every person I saw throughout the year, the letter would have just been a list of names. At the end, I wrote that while I could not include everyone, I was overjoyed to see so many loved ones this year.I was proud of my letter, until my mom (65F) and uncle (68M), received theirs, and sent me several unhinged texts about all the people I didn't mention individually by name, wondering if it was intentional, or if people had somehow upset me, or if I was just a terrible person. Both thought the letter was unnecessary and in my mom's words, \"totally inappropriate and odd\".I'm terribly upset, although nobody who was actually omitted has reached out to tell me how slighted they felt. I wanted to highlight people I spent time with in person throughout the year. People I saw once at an event were harder to capture, although mentioning the event we were at, and sending them the card, was meant to be a gesture of goodwill. Throughout the year I have exchanged emails, messages, pleasantries, and gifts with people who weren't mentioned. When I have received a gift, I have sent a thank-you note or card, and I try to maintain friendly relationships with everyone I sent a card to. It would have been weird to send holiday cards to people I wasn't close to.If I'm fully in the wrong here, I would very much like to know, but I am extremely distressed by the texts I have received. Are they just petty, or is there legitimacy behind them that I should address? I am considering writing the people mentioned individual texts and reaching out to effectively say -- hey, it was brought to my attention that you weren't highlighted in my annual letter, and I wanted to apologize; I hope you know that you're special to me and I didn't mean to omit you, I always enjoy our connection and any opportunity we have to spend time together/chat.Or should I give up on the annual letter forever? I'm sufficiently humiliated where I want to dig myself a hole and jump right down, which pretty much removes any interesting fodder for a 2024 letter. If it helps provide context, both of the offended parties are pretty far along the BPD spectrum, but it was jarring to receive these messages when I was so confident about what I sent out. I had never done an annual letter before, and I read up on how they were written, what they should and should not contain, and what to highlight. Nothing prepared me for this!Am I the asshole?",

I've known Alex for over 10 years, but I've had some issues with Emma, who he’s been with for a bit over a year. Recently, she pulled a prank on Instagram where she posted breakup song lyrics to get a reaction out of Alex, and she then posted his texts on their close friends stories. I texted her about it, expressing my disapproval and to please not do it again, since I feel those pranks where you intentionally mislead someone are immature. Emma got defensive, saying it was HER relationship and she could so what she wanted. I wasn’t trying to pick a fight, but things escalated when she started making personal comments against me, such as how I should know my place, or how I’m always giving unwanted opinions (Edit: I should clarify that this in particular feels like a flat out lie on her part, as I can only recall one time I gave my opinion on something regarding their relationship, and it was something small. I’ve never genuinely meddled or argued about anything I didn’t “approve of” before this), or how she didn’t say anything when I was “dealing with my little thing”, among other things. For context, I left for an exchange semester abroad in August, and my ex partner ended our relationship before I left because they feared dealing with long distance. I got frustrated and told her to watch her attitude, because in the end, I’ll be at Alex’s wedding, but she might not be. Alex asked me to please stop fighting with her, so I did and left the conversation, ignoring what she said afterwards.Alex asked me to apologize, but I refused initially due to Emma’s hurtful comments. Eventually, I apologized, but Emma didn't respond. Alex stopped replying to my texts soon after. When I confronted him about it, he said Emma was still upset and he couldn’t be talking to me so as to avoid making things worse (Edit: I should add, he also was avoiding talking to me because he had also done something that upset her recently and she felt like he “wasn’t on her side enough”, so he didn’t want to add more fuel to the fire I guess). I thought it was dumb and toxic that he needed “permission” to talk to me, but I let it be and focused on my semester abroad. After some time, Alex said Emma was \"okay\" with us talking again, so we caught up from time to time while I was away.Upon returning from my exchange semester, I texted Alex to make plans, but he ignored my texts. I called his brother to ask what was wrong, but he said Alex just said he was busy. He hasn’t said a word to me since and I can only suspect it’s because talking to me would make Emma upset again. I'm hurt that it seems he’d ignore a long-term friendship to avoid upsetting what I perceive as a toxic relationship.So, AITA? Maybe I should’ve just minded my business, but I felt I was right to call out a toxic prank and say something mean in return after Emma escalated things needlessly.",

They would be seen all of the time from all of the main living areas of the house (front entrance, living room, kitchen, dining room, back entrance, etc).I’m proud of him and feel bad about shutting down this idea, but at the same time I put so much thought and effort into the look of our home and I know it would drive me nuts to have to look at it every single day. I’m not opposed to having them hung in the house, just not as the center of the home.My compromise was to put it in the basement, or the dining room, or the spare bedroom which is entirely his. But he’s still not thrilled about it and is pretty upset with me for not being on board. AITA?Edited for clarification purposes***",

	"body" : "For some context while also keeping this brief, my (36m) first wife passed away around 7 years ago. It was extremely sudden and traumatic for all of us, but I think it affected my daughter Emma (14f) the most.She went through a period of time where she became really angry at everything and everyone, but nowadays she's become more quiet, while my son Jacob (16m) became very dedicated to schoolwork and his future.I got remarried two years ago to Kate (34f) and while it took a while, she gets along with the kids well enough, and Emma especially seems to have really warmed up to her and they spend a lot of time together.I work for most of the week and lately it's been from home, so I can't spend as much time with the kids as I would like, but I always make sure to talk to them while we're having dinner. Almost every night Jacob will tell me about something impressive he did at school and I'll congratulate him and tell him I'm proud of him and sometimes give him extra in his allowance. Like I said, Emma is quiet and doesn't really talk much at all at dinner. On Saturday night after a bit of coaxing from Kate, Emma told me she got to a B in her science class (which is pretty rare for her) and I told her I was happy for her.Later that same night while I was working she came into my office and asked if I wanted to see her creative writing project for her English class, but I told her I was busy and she could show me tomorrow. I didn't get a look at her but as she was walking out she said \"If it was Jacob asking you would drop everything you were doing\"In the morning after the kids went to school, Kate came to me and said I needed to stop being so dense and that she was tired of having Emma come to her crying because her own father will barely pay attention to her or give her a compliment.I didn't think I was doing anything particularly harmful or neglectful, but I've been second guessing myself and figured I would lay it out here for others to judge.",

	"body" : "There’s this girl, Jane (F18), who’s in a few of my (M18) classes at uni, and my friends and I sometimes hang out with her. Jane is really nice, but unfortunately, she has a lot of confidence issues when it comes to her looks. Don’t get me wrong; I think she looks fine. Most people think she’s pretty. However, for whatever reason, Jane is convinced she’s horribly ugly.Jane says a lot of self-deprecating humour about her looks, and for a good while, I thought she was just messing around. However, her friend, Kate (F18), told me that she was serious, and honestly, after paying closer attention, this became clear to me as well.So last night, I was hanging out with Jane, Kate, their other friends Maggie (F18) and Sophie (F19), and my friends Eric (M18) and Zak (M18). I don't know what was different about last night, but Jane didn’t seem too happy and was making several comments about how she looked, like she normally does.Whenever she does this in the past, Eric, Zak, and her friends will say things like “No, you’re pretty” or something similar. You get the idea. Whenever they look at me to say something, I always say something neutral, like “You look normal” or “You don’t look bad,” or I’ll shrug. Eric and Zak have told me privately in the past that I should probably say something nicer. Kate and Maggie even told me that I should, since they think I’m hard to please, and Jane would really appreciate hearing it from me because of that. I honestly don’t see the point, as whatever caused Jane to be like this can’t be solved with positive affirmation, imo.So last night, after everyone was calling her pretty and such, she kept looking over at me, and I was just like “You look tired and should probably moisturize your skin.” It was a perfectly honest observation at the time because she did look tired and her skin looked dry (its been cold the last few days so that’s probably why).Jane didn’t look happy with my response, and someone sort of changed the topic. When I was going back to my dorm with Eric, he told me that Jane was probably really upset that I didn’t say she was good-looking or something. When I told him that words weren’t really going to do anything for Jane and that she needed to change her mindset about overvaluing looks, he said that I was being a bit of a dick.AITA?Edit - I showed this post to my roommate \"Eric\" and he said I should also add in the point I had made to him in the past which was: One day I (OP) will say something nice about Jane's looks and since I've been dismissive about them so far, she'll probably fall head-over-heels for me.I forgot about saying that, but I largely said it as a joke. I don't really see what it adds though...Edit - For those wondering, she looks perfectly fine, there isn't anything wrong with how she looks. It really is just that she thinks she isn't pretty.",

I pay them in yuan and arrange the delivery over wechat so there is no tip and tax and they give me discounted prices.A week later she didn't have many groceries left and she asked me to add something for her and she will pay me back. I refused because she isn't part of the agreement and I don't want to betray the restaurant owners and also she wouldn't be able to pay me back in yuan.She seems upset and isn't being as cordial.aitaEdit: Ok the problem has been solved, i contacted two of the restaurants which are the ones i most frequently use and they told me it is fine to order for my roommate and she can order herself if she installs wechat. She doesnt want to use wechat so i have told her she can ask me.For those saying tax evasion etc, these restaurant owners are really kind people and often even give free meals at their restaurants to chinese international students who are struggling (sometimes others too not just chinese just that most customers are asian). I work now and am not a student anymore but they know that and said i can still use the services.This is a lot cheaper than uber eats and doordash but the only thing is you need to order only at lunch or dinner time.",

	"body" : "My wife (28F) and I (32M) are expecting our first child this summer. This will also be my parent’s first grandchild. My mom is obviously very excited. She also LOVES to shop and buy gifts. It can often be overwhelming but I know this is the way she shows love. I would consider myself more of a minimalist and try to just buy and keep what I need. My wife and my two younger siblings are similar, my mom knows this, and it is often something we all joke about and tease her about when a care package with half of Marshall’s arrives and we don’t know what to do with it all.Today a package arrived from her with about 20 different baby outfits in it. Some we loved, others we simply couldn’t imagine dressing our daughter in. I wanted to tease her a bit and give her some feedback on some of the outfits we liked and which ones we didn’t, while still being appreciative for the gift. I just know that this is the beginning of *many* more gifts to come throughout my daughter’s life and it just feels so wasteful to turn around and donate piles of unused stuff. I'm thinking ahead to birthdays and christmases and would really like to set some boundaries around gift giving with her. My thought was that if she could get a better sense of our taste / style, less would go to waste. The following texts were exchanged:Me: [Picture of one of the outfits we didn't love]Me: MomHer: You know those are adorable! *kissing emoji*Her: Did you not like the cute outfits?Me: Thank you for the clothes!!! Can we gently nudge you towards our style? lolMe: If you won't be offended I'll show you which ones we really like and which ones... not so much hahaHer: There's a place you need to visit on Reddit. It's called, am I the asshole? Go there and post what you said to your mom who picked out a variety of adorable clothes for the first grandchild in the family. Sent with zero strings attached, only with love and joy for her son and his beautiful wife. Include some photos. Let's see what others think, because in my humble opinion, your response is so unacceptable, I simply don't know what else to say.Me: Woah I'm sorry! We really are appreciative! Can we talk?Her: I've had people who said nothing at all, that were more appreciative. That's ok- I'll just put cash in a card for you.Me: Will you please answer the phoneHer: Honestly, no need to talk about this. I've learned my lesson. No harm no foul. I should have known better- It's on me.I tried calling her a few times to clear the air but she didn’t want to talk.I’m certainly willing to accept that I was the asshole here and after reflecting, I definitely could have led with showing more appreciation for the gifts and communicated more tactfully. I also could have just let it go, chalked it up to grandma being a grandma, said thank you and just donated the unwanted clothes.AITA? What would you do in this situation?Edit: Here's a link to an image of one of the outfits (the image I sent her): https://imgur.com/a/pFL21vt",

	"body" : "All families have drama. This was probably our biggest drama in 2 1/2 years since my boyfriend and I at that time called and told his mom we were getting married and she hung up on us. Fast forward a few years.My husband and I had been married for 2 1/2 years and I was stationed overseas in Japan and forward deployed which meant we were gone about 300 days a year. It was fast approaching the holidays and I was off the ship for 6 weeks recovering from foot surgery. It was suggested for me to take leave over thanksgiving instead of Christmas since I was technically off the ship anyways.So my husband and I change our plans. Tell his parents who had plans to attend their dad’s (who had passed 20 year’s previously) twin brothers 75 birthday party in Florida. They live in CT.We made plans to visit them. We told them due to the flight and all that we wouldn’t be attending the trip to Florida with them. We were really bummed. But long story short our return trip would have been a 24 hour drive in my old car that his dad had been driving. Then getting on an international flight back to Japan. We were only home for like 8 days it just wasn’t going to be done.Thank God we didn’t drive it either because his dads car broke down while we driving. Around town. The family was obviously mad that we didn’t go with them. Understandable. They had driven to Florida in their car. My husband and I went to drop the car off at the dealership and asked sil if we could borrow her car to drive behind then head home. She was on the trip with her parents. She said No. it was weird to us because we’re like we’re trying to help out your parents but whatever you say no. So we are getting ready to leave and there is a knock at the door. The boyfriends brother to my sil is at the door saying oh I need to get something from her room. I’ll be right back. Turns out he came over to get the keys just to make sure we didn’t drive her car.My husband and I drove the dads car to the dealership and paid for all the repairs because the dad had been laid off from his job. This was the car we would have driven to Florida if we had gone. They were upset that we didn’t go to Florida with them. Which is why my sil was being so rude to us.Probably am an asshole for poor writing. I think I fixed it up more. But essentially my husband’s parents were actually pissed we didn’t go on the trip with them To Florida. They wanted us to drive the dads car. Which broke down and we would have been stranded on the road. It was a crazy repair. We we’re grateful we didn’t do the drive to Florida. But disappointed that we took the dads car to the dealership and paid for the repairs. His sister was 17 ish  at the time and we were 24 and 22. Still young kids ourselves. Who didn’t have a  ton of money. But paid for repairs to a car that wasn’t our responsibility. But we cared about them to help them out.We stayed the whole thanksgiving time and never saw his immediate family. Because they were gone our whole trip home. The trip was ok and nice to meet with others in the family. But really wished we could have seen them and didn’t have to deal with the drama.Edit context- this was 2008 circa. No Ubers. No smart phones and my husband and I were too young to rent a car. We were doing his parents a favor by fixing their broke car and paying for it. Asking his teenage sister to borrow the car to help us to help his parents shouldn’t be viewed as being difficult. They were mad because we didn’t go on the trip to Florida with them which is what they wanted. But we also didn’t have the finances after buying our own flights from japan where I was a lowly E4. and my husband made 12$/ hour. More context.Edit I don’t know how to fix this post to make it more legible. My husband and I had not been home in almost 3 years. The military forced me to change my Vacation time. Husbands family had a different trip planned and we didn’t have enough money, or physical time to travel for only 8 days home. The expectation for us was to do whatever possible to travel to Florida with them and when we didn’t do that they gave us a hard time.",

I at least interpreted it that way since she gets with many men so I didn’t think it would matter. Flash forward to the party, the host of the party ran into her room to tell a group of guys that my roommate was coming, and they all went on their phones immediately. They were telling their friend, a boy who is head over heels obsessed with my roommate. This guys totally crazy OBSESSED with her and his friends and she knows it.

When my boyfriend hears this, he laughs and when the guys ask why he was laughing he says “she had a guy over last night anyway” to everyone. Later that night, when my roommate is leaving the party, the kid who is obsessed with her arrives. He thinks she is leaving because he just got there, but she was leaving to go out anyway. He did not believe that, and made a big deal to the guys at the party about it. Finally, one of the hosts tells him that she had a guy over last night and she has no intention of being with him. The kid storms out of the party and texted my roommate something, we don’t know what, but we all think he told her he knew she had a guy over the night before. She then texts me and my boyfriend telling us to go fuck ourselves and blocks both of us. The next day, AKA the day of the concert, I go back to my apartment to shower and see she is not at the concert or getting ready to go to the concert. She had told me days before that she was planning on going. I didn’t say anything to her, I just left and when I got to my boyfriends house I told him that and we came up with a theory: she was going to go to the Travis Scott concert for free with the kid who is obsessed with her. I text one of the party hosts this theory and she quickly responds that I am right and that he took the ticket back from her today and is now going with someone else.

I was on the phone arranging for her cousin (20M) to stay at our house as part of a trip to a different city.

She just continued to walk away.She didn't leave her room for over 24 hours. Then I got a message from her in our group chat asking if he had left. I admit this annoyed me as I didn't understand why she was making a big deal over her younger cousin who looks up to her, so I replied saying \"Are you really hiding from your cousin? Your little cousin?\" and she just asked me to answer the question so I told her she should come and find out. She replied back \"I'm honestly sick and tired of playing these games with you.\" She didn't come back out for another 24 hours.

She mentioned another exchange that happened an hour after the above one, and this exchange the next day I called her out for being antagonistic. She said that she was already distraught and on edge after I \"made fun of her\", and then I came into her room, \"badgered\" her with questions about claiming disability in the hiring process, and didn't even ask her why she was being standoffish in her response. Honestly I didn't care for her reasoning, the whole thing is ridiculous and she's always being dramatic and hostile over people coming to the house.

Without my knowing, my oldest sought him out on FaceBook of all places. Though her she has brought him in to be involved with the family the past few years. While they may have had an instant connection, I feel embarrassed to say I just haven’t. I’m happy to know that he’s doing well in life, he’s getting married this spring and he has a doctoral degree in physics. It’s all very nice to be proud of but it’s like learning about a stranger, I certainly don’t feel like his mother.This thanksgiving we hosted. All three of my children were present. My son follows a guide dog to get around, but often when he is over he takes off the harness and lets the dog play with the other family dogs. That day was much the same. I gave the dogs some scraps to eat and didn’t think anything more of it. Several days later it turns out his dog was at the emergency vet hospital and had some issues with maybe its pancreas and also a possible bone trapped in its intestine. They decided to take the dog to surgery to search for it and have it removed. My daughter immediately asked if I had given the dogs anything and was furious with me over giving them some table scraps. She is adamant I caused this issue and I shouldn be offering to pay.I did reach out to my son to offer to pay. He said that was kind but he had it covered. I told him I didn’t want him to worry financially because I know it can be hard for him to keep employment given his condition. All he said was he has pet health insurance so after deductible he only pays 10% and he has completely capable of paying for it. We left it at that. My daughter is still now refusing to bring her dogs to my home, calling me irresponsible. She is blaming me and feels I “never take responsibility” for the “harm” I cause, but I cannot pay if her refuses to take my money.",

	"body" : "UPDATE! :Well, I certainly wasn't expecting this post to get this many responses, so I first wanted to start off by thanking each and every one of you for taking the time to read my post and weigh in with your judgment  (even the people that sent me death threats in the DMs, you know who you are)Special thanks to those who sent in their judgments via DM when the mods locked down the thread.After reading the comments and having time to cool down and think about all this.. I accept that I was an asshole in this situation.While I was right to be mad, I overacted and made this situation something that it wasn't.This is also a wake-up call for me to stop being lazy and do a better job of securing my documents. I'll admit that the inconvenience of locking everything down led me to become sloppy. Not anymore, I've already ordered a lock for my office door and a fireproof safe for my paper files. My desk has lockable drawers, and my computer is password protected. I'm also seriously considering a security camera.Last night, I probably spent 20 minutes apologizing to both my niece and sister. I promised that I would never yell at her or use that type of language towards her ever again. She accepted my apology, we gave each other a hug, and she also apologized for being in the office. My sister forgave me as well.I also took them out to their favorite restaurant. My niece and I had a conversation over dinner about the importance of attorney client privilege and the secure handling of confidential information. 2 things that are extremely important if she's serious about becoming a lawyer. She seemed genuinely curious, and I answered all her questions that I could about the type of cases that I handel.When we got home, I decided to surprise her.  I showed her around the office, and I let her take another picture at my desk (after I put away all my sensitive files, of course).Thanks, reddit,Numerous CycleMy(28M) Sister(33F) is visiting me this week with her daughter/my niece (13F). I was excited to host them in my house as I haven't really seen my family much ever since I moved away from our home state for my career.For context, I'm a lawyer at a large firm. That means that I have to take work home often, which is why I have a room in my house set up as an office.My office has privileged information about cases and clients.Long story short, when my sister and niece arrived yesterday and after I helped them get settled in, I told them that there's only one rule that I have for staying in my house: My office is off limits.Fast forward a few hours and Everything's fine and dandy, I'm just sitting on the couch with my sister, watching a movie, until I get a call from a senior associate at work asking me to do a quick review of a document that he sent me via email.When I get upstairs, I see the door to my office is wide open, and the lights are on. When I go in to investigate, my niece is in there sitting in my chair and taking selfies with her feet on my desk.I was beyond furious,I only have one rule for guests at my house, and it's to stay out of my office. I have that rule for a reason. Not only would I be at risk of disbarment, but the integrity of the entire case would be jeopardized if any of that information is leaked.While I'm not accusing her of that specifically, I just don't want uninvolved people in my office taking pictures and posting them on social media where there may or may not be protected Information in view of the camera.I asked her what the hell she was doing, and she said, \"I was just curious, I want to be a lawyer like you when I grow up.\"I told her  \"get the fuck out and stay out you little bitch\".My sister came running up the stairs after my niece started crying and she told me that I was a \"monster\" for \"talking like that to a kid\"I told her that she had no business being in my office, and my sister said that it dosent matter because \"she's just a kid\".So,AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for replacing my maid of honor?",
	"body" : "I am getting married and my bachelorette party has started being planned. My best friend Katie  is planning the bachelorette party. I had not officially asked her yet to be my maid of honor but it was assumed. We’ve been friends since Kindergarten and talked about this our whole lives. Prior to meeting my fiance we had quite a party lifestyle and Katie always joked around about this being the last hoorah.We were going over the guest list to the bachelorette and I explained I wanted my mother in law and my fiancés brothers wives to attend. So an additional 3 people. I let her know I had told them they were invited.Katie said she didn’t want them there because the activities wouldn’t be appropriate. So I said that’s okay and we can find something else to do and that if anyone paid any deposits or any cancellation fees I’d give her the money spent back.After some arguing Katie said I’m taking all her work for granted and that she was done. I wasn’t sure if she said that out of anger (that would be typical for her) or not so I called one of my future sister in laws, Jess, and just needed to vent. Jess said she’d come over and we’d figure it out. Jess called my other future sister in law, Ashley, and they came over with my mother in law and we planned a whole new bachelorette party in a couple hours. (I’m actually really excited for it.)They really saved the day. I had a conversation with my fiance and asked if he’d think it was weird if I asked them both to be my maid of honors instead. They were both already going to be bridesmaids and their husbands are my fiancés best men. My fiance said he thinks they’d really love that and it would help us bond more. So the next day I officially asked them both at family dinner in front of my in laws, fiance, his brothers, and some extended family. We all cried and none of us have sisters so we all joked about how we finally had them.My future sister in laws posted pictures to social media and captioned it “All the (insert last name) girls. We can’t wait to spend this special day with our newest sister.”Katie saw this and flipped out on me about how I’m just replacing her and how I don’t even care about her feelings. She said I’m throwing away our friendship over girls who haven’t been there for me my whole life. And how could I just replace her role on the most important day of my life within 24 hours. Katie even commented on the post saying “the betrayal”.Katie is making me feel like such an AH. My fiance thinks Katie is overreacting and for me not to worry about it. I just want someone’s opinion who unbiased. AITA?Update:I had a conversation with my husband and we’ve read most of the comments. He agrees that under no circumstances would we tell my sister in laws that they wouldn’t be the maid of honors anymore. They’ve been nothing but wonderful, supportive, and helpful. And we also took into the consideration that maybe Katie and I are just drifting apart and growing differently.I did call Katie and tell her that I love her, appreciate her, and want nothing but the best for her always but that I am going to keep my sister in laws as my maid of honor and that I want her to be my bridesmaid more than anything but I understand if she doesn’t want to be.Katie said she still wants to be a bridesmaid but she’s hurt and feels like I’ll replace her with them. We talked and I don’t know where our friendship will end up but it seems like right now we’re okay.",

Well it got closer to time to leave and the temperature outside dropped pretty bad. I commented to a coworker (call him Russ) that it was freezing, and he asked where my coat was, I said I didn't think to bring one. He told me to wear his hoodie to keep warm and I can just bring it back to him the next day once I got my coat. I gave mild protest not wanting to inconvenience him, but he insisted so I put it on and went home.I didn't really think anything of it until I got home and my BF, Jim, saw it on me and asked \"Where did you get that?\" So I told him a guy at work let me borrow it. He got really mad and started asking me about who this guy is, why he's giving me his clothes, why I thought it was okay to wear them and it just kinda shocked me. He wasn't calling me names or anything but he was very upset about it. I told him Russ is just a coworker, nothing more (absolutely true, even if I was single Russ wouldn't be on my radar). Jim told me that it's not cool for girls to be wearing guy's clothes they aren't in a relationship with, and that it's seen as an intimate act to wear their clothes. I just didn't want to be cold and I told him repeatedly that it had no further meaning, but he just kinda blew me off and stopped talking.It's been about a week now and Jim is still acting a little cold and distant towards me, there's been no more outbursts or any accusations but it's making me feel like I did something horrible, even though I didn't think it was a big deal.

	"body" : "I 18F am a first year medical student in the UK. Please read the full story for an even judgement.When I was about 16/17 I did a year of volunteering as a patient supporter/befriender for my med school application. There was a elderly woman who didn't speak English only Arabic and she was shouting the SAME sentence in Arabic from the second I got there to the second they took her away for some medical procedure. (We know she was shouting in Arabic because a volunteer there recognised some words she said).At first I was concerned and all of the volunteers tried to get her to calm down in turns which worked for like 20 seconds then she would start up again. The nurses and a staff member who was in charge of us told us to ignore her and told us that she usually does this. They made a joke out of it and laughed at of her. When I went into the room with her alone she shouted the same sentence at me like she was trying to speak to me in her language but I just kind of mockingly repeated the sentence back to her and left.I reminded the nurses that she was still shouting and urged them to do something about it, that's when she got taken away.Another instance on the same day, was when an old Chinese lady who was bed-bound was communicating with me in only hand motions. I didn't understand what she meant so I just kept feeding her crackers and smiling at her whilst I sat on the chair next to her bed. I mean she ate them... but she didn't stop doing the hand motions so I figured that was NOT what she wanted. She finally motioned towards her mid-region and I realised she needed a bedpan.(I am not trained in handling patients so I couldn't help her myself)I went to ask the nurse and they said they would get right on it but I noticed they hadn't and everytime I'd walk past she was still just laying there tracking me with her eyes. I kinda brushed it off that maybe the nurses were busy and walked off. I came back AGAIN and there was no bedpan. I got the same nurse and said she really needs to go to the toilet, only then did the nurse act.. (she wasn't even that busy tbh).The chinese lady smiled at me so I hope thats what she wanted.On the way home I kinda felt bad for not following up the Chinese lady's issues and mimicking the Arabic lady.EDIT: Damn you guys really ate me up!  I appreciate it though. You are all right in your judgement and I am totally the Asshole to the power of 2. I have responded badly in the comments, I was butthurt and upset at how harsh the comments were but reading them with clear eyes this afternoon I realise they were not harsh, just  the real, hard, truth.I am not leaving the medical field. I am a completely different person to what I was 2 years ago. I am not evil. I would not just watch a patient in distress and do nothing. One lapse in judgement does not define me, I know who I am and what I can be. I will be a doctor who is compassionate and can admit when they are wrong. I will never be as callous and heinous as I was at 16. I had to learn the hard way unfortunately.What I did to that woman will haunt me for the rest of my life. It will push me to not do this to anyone ever again.Today I am not perfect. I am not good, I am not bad. Nobody is good but God, I still make mistakes and may not be the most sensitive and emotionally heightened person. But I am human and I can empathize with other people's pain.PS: As a volunteer I was not trained in handling patients so if I touched the Chinese lady and something went wrong I would be in a big cauldron of apology soup and legal liabilities.",

I'm not FIDE titled or anything, but I play enough to know what those terms mean, and I'm one of those guys who hangs out in parks on occasion and will play anyone who wants a game.The other day, with some relatively mild weather, I went to hang out in the local park and set up my board for anyone who wanted to play. Along comes this boy with his mother, he looked maybe 8 or 9 years old. He said he played, and he wanted to play me. I asked his mother if it was all right, she said sur,, and we settled down for a game while mommy did something on her phone. I beat him pretty quickly and easily. And then, like I do for pretty much any game I play, after the game I set things back up and did a quick review of the game. In this case, since it was so one-sided, it was mostly me giving the kid tips for not getting wiped out like that again.He listened to a few of the initial opening recommendations, but after about a minute or two of this he started getting really upset. Wasn't crying, but seemed not too far off. Realizing something was off, I asked if he wanted to stop the review and do something else, but he ran over to his mom and started saying that I was bullying him and calling him a bad player. Mom then starts laying into me, saying it's absurd that a grown man would go all out just to plaster a child and I should haven't gone full bore on him and then tell him about all the mistakes he made. I made a few perfunctory apologies and made my escape.I admit, analyzing a game after it's finished is pretty standard for the circles I play in. But the circles I play in are generally adults and all fairly serious chess players who have an eye on how to improve their games, not kids and definitely not casual players (Which this kid seemed to be judging from the state of his play). AITA for applying that kind of game-etiquette to an interaction with a child?TL;DR. I played a kid in the park and as is my habit, I went over the game afterwards, pointing out quite a few errors he made during the game with an eye to helping him improve.

Cindy hates me, and has punished Jerry by keeping Conrad from him due to our relationship. The only times she will let Jerry spend time with Conrad is if he takes Jack with him as well.Jack is a very disrespectful, entitled kid. He will only contact Jerry if he wants money sent to him on cashapp and never says thank you. He will ignore all adults besides his mom, he will either ignore Jerry or give him sarcastic & rude answers if addressed. I’ve seen him flip Jerry off behind his back and when I have confronted him about it, he will laugh and point in my face saying ‘It’s funny you’re getting so mad because it’s a joke’ Jerry does nothing. He ignores it and refuses to engage.I have told Jerry in the past that I don’t like Jacks behavior and I don’t want Jack in my home. I said I’m sorry that Cindy is being so petty about our situation and holding your son against you for it but you should go to court and figure that out, just as I am. He says because I am in court with my ex that he doesn’t want to add more stress by taking his ex to court himself for his own kid.So this year, (just like every year since he doesn’t celebrate Christmas for whatever reason,) I went all out for ‘our’ teenage boys 15M & 17M. (Technically they’re his from his first babymama but she isn’t in the picture at all and I’ve known both boys almost since they were born).I paid for all the presents (which for teens can be pricey) and spent a lot of time bringing that jolly feel to the house. Despite my only biological kid (7M) being with his dad this year, I tried to make this Christmas special for the older boys since they’ll be adults soon starting their own Christmas traditions with their kids.But on Christmas Eve I woke up alone. He left a note saying he was picking up Conrad which was fine so I called him and he said he was on his way home. No mention of Jack. Jerry gets home and comes to our bedroom, we talk, and no mention of Jack. I didn’t think I’d deliberately have to ask him but I did. He brought Jack too.This ruined my Christmas. Jack goes out of his way to let me know he doesn’t like me. If I talk to someone else around him, he mocks me. If I ask him something he ignores me or has a sarcastic rude reply. Once Jack overheard an argument between Jerry and i, he then went and lied to his school counselor saying it sounded like we were hitting each-other during the argument and CPS got involved, and later dropped the case.So my options were endure that or just stay holed up in our bedroom, or run some errands on Christmas eve. I took 4 hours to run errands, no text or call from Jerry. When i got home Jack and Conrad were gone and Jerry was mad  that i didn't want Jack around on Christmas and said i was keeping his son from him by not wanting his ex's kid here too.

Sara even talked about having the boys leave early if I didn't agree not to take them. To stop the arguing I agreed I'd respect their wishes, but I'm still considering taking the boys either way. I don't see what the big deal is, Jake and Sara can take them again in the spring. Sam says if I do it, he'll side with Jake and Sara if they no longer trust me after that, which I told him is utterly ridiculous.WIBTA?",

	"body" : "My (18F) brother (21M) works a pretty high position at a state job (Idk if this is how it's translated in English) where realistically he wouldn't be able to get in due to his studies and qualifications. And yet he somehow managed to do it and now he's bragging about it to our parents and even the rest of our family and when asked how he got in he just gives some vague answers.Well I accidentally found on his phone some his messages towards his (male) boss and all I can say is that they were ... definitely not work related. I read enough to know for a fact that he's been sleeping with him, which explains how he managed to get a position he's unqualified for. At the New Years' family dinner started bragging again about how he's doing hard work at his work and I decided to humble him by saying \"I'm sure you do a lot of hard work on your knees\". Everyone from our family took it as a joke except for my brother who got visibly scared as he probably realized by then that I knew his secret.After the dinner he asked me in private for what the hell was my comment for and I told that he doesn't need play dumb with me and that I know his little affair with his boss. He just told me to stay the f away from his business and hasn't talked with me ever since. I'm not sure if he's even gonna show at the next family gathering.AITA ?",

	"body" : "I am currently 29 weeks pregnant with our first child, and my partner and I are beginning to solidify our ideal birth plan. So far, our pregnancy has been totally normal, healthy, and low-risk. As such, we are planning for a waterbirth; I am really compelled by the intimate, and comfortable experience of waterbirth. There is a waterbirth center affiliated with the medical center I've been going to, and the birth would be overseen by both the doula we've been working with, as well as a certified midwife.The issue is that my husband refuses to get into the tub with me for the birth. The pools at the center are large, and can easily fit 2 people - they're basically large, deep jet baths/small hot tubs with drains, and the water can easily be replaced. We've been told it isn't uncommon for partners to be in the tub.I want him to be in the tub with me for at least part of the birth so he can physically comfort/hold/support me through it. To me, him being in the pool would give me both the mental and physical support that would not feel the same if he were outside it. In my head, the birth just wouldn't be the same - it would somehow be less intimate or special. Maybe that's not true, but it's how I feel right now. He refuses because he thinks it will be gross - that the water will be dirty and in his words \"unsanitary\" and \"icky.\"  He argues that his support will be the same regardless of whether or not he is in the tub.While I understand where he's coming from and want to be amenable, I still want him in the tub. We've talked about our individual perspectives at length, worked with the birthing center, and shared this issue with friends but it feels like we are at an impasse. I wish I could just get over it but it's been a sticking point for us. So AITA for wanting him to be in the tub with me?EDIT: I want to add that we're still talking about this - and ultimately I'm not going to force him to do anything. I just want to know if my preference is asshole-ish.",

We have fights about it in the past but recently his mom been dating this guy for while . They bought a new car together and have moved in together . The guy is pretty well set off , however whenever anything she needs new or needs, she’s runs to my husband. So eventually her phone hasn’t been working, and he feels the need to buy her a new phone knowing there are total of 2 other siblings that can help out as well. All who make 6 figured salary but lately we have been tight on money and with a our first baby on the way, I don’t find it fair , knowing we still have things to buy & I am on maternity leave. Am I the asshole for wanting to tell my husband he should not need to buy his mom a new phone and that it’s better she tells her boyfriend to buy it for her , since they have already moved in together and bought a luxury car together , what makes it different that he needs too?",

	"body" : "Obligatory on mobile so sorry for any mistakes.I (27, F) met my friend, I will call her Aurora (21, F), at work. We hit it off quickly and became close friends. We ended up getting matching tattoos and introduced our friends to each other.Aurora was big on drinking and going out, whereas I’m an introvert and prefer to stay home. She went to a Halloween party last year and ended up hooking up with our mutual friend’s ex-girlfriend. I told her I didn’t like that but she said it was fine, our mutual friend didn’t care. I still told her I wasn’t interested in hearing about their sex life and ended up distancing myself a little.Fast forward maybe a month, Aurora and I were at work one day and I mentioned to her that we don’t hang out anymore. She told me to invite her places and I told her I don’t even go anywhere, she’s the outgoing one and to invite me places. That night, my other friend I will call Stanley (39, M) told me that Aurora asked him to hang out. I said to him “she can invite you to hang out but I literally told her today that we don’t hang out anymore”, he ended up leaving her on read.It’s now January, and her birthday was coming up. Stanley asked me if Aurora invited me to her birthday party, I told him no she didn’t. He said she invited him and his girlfriend, I ranted to him because she’s supposedly my best friend and he agreed that she can be very immature. Aurora and I usually donate blood together and we went on a Friday, the day before her birthday. She kept mentioning she was only donating blood because she wanted to get super drunk for her birthday and get so f**ked up on dr*gs. I asked her what she was doing and she only said getting really drunk for it.On her birthday I texted her happy birthday, she only said thankyou. Not even a pity invite. The next working day we had together, it was a Wednesday, she spoke to me like nothing happened and started going on about how much fun she had and how much great s*x she had. I just made small talk about that then only spoke to her about work. Our co-worker asked her why I wasn’t invited and Aurora said “I only invited people I wanted there, so mind your own business”. She has since been fired from work (took too many sick days off), and texted me that she was looking for another job already and she was sorry for “sucking” and that she loved me. We would always say that platonically. I left her on read.5 days later, I get this text message: “I don’t know if we’re ok, I’m sorry for fucking up. I didn’t know it would affect you in any way and I should’ve taken it more seriously. Hope you’re doing well” I again left her on read.Am I the asshole for being upset over this? AITA for ignoring her and not saying why? Sorry for long post.TLDR: “best friend” didn’t invite me to her birthday and told someone she only invited who she wanted there. AITA for being upset?",

	"title" : "AITA for being frustrated with my teacher?",
	"body" : "This was before I was able to have an Iphone and IPad with eBooks on them.I (13F) am in 7th grade. I was given an assignment in language arts to do a photo essay on Bristol board. First, the teacher simply said we must pick a non-fiction book to base our assignment on. I only live near one library. My mom went to that one and got me a biography, as the workers literally said those were the only non-fiction books available. I brought it in, only for the teacher to then say \"no biographies\". I was luckily able to lie to my teacher about my topic, and she didn't even bother to check. Sadly, another kid who also had a biography got detention as the teacher was able to see he had a biography. We also have a school library but she said that for this assignment we aren't allowed to use any non-fiction books from there.I didn't have any other choice but to use this old computer at my house to use the Internet for information about the topic I said. Nobody else could have the same topic as each other. The rubric mentioned nothing about citations as it was presumed that only the book would be used for information.She also made a rule that she wouldn't take any points off for having photos sticking out of the board. I had been relieved about this. However, everyone else got their essays back, while she kept mine back. Even kids who handed in their essays late and got marks off for it got their essays back before mine. I raised my hand to try to bring this to her attention, but she just gave me a look and turned away. The students were waiting to ask the teacher questions, so I stood with them. When it was my turn, I said \"Hello\" and then she asked in an irritated voice \"What do you want?\" I then politely pointed out that I didn't get my essay back. She then said in an irritated voice \"Can you wait?\" Then, she called me in for a meeting after class about my essay. I felt nervous and tried not to cry, but my eyes were watery. She then screamed at me, asking me \"What is this behavior? Stop this behavior now!\" cause she saw the water in my eyes. I then said, \"yes m'am\".She began to rant, asking \"What is this?\" then she proceeded to compare my work with my peers work who did better work and talked about their work. She then proceeded to mock me, as at the beginning of the year everyone had to have a goal for themselves and share it and mine was to make the honor roll. She proceeded to laugh in my face and I cried. She started commenting on how hysterical I was.I then had to present my work to my class the next day. I was so anxious that I cried during lunch and begged mom to let me stay home but she said I had to go :(.When the teacher was confronted by mom, the teacher (known to lie to parents and act sweet in front of them) said that I was upset because I didn't get 100% on the assignment (not true) so mom started saying \"well you can't get 100 all the time sweetie it's unrealistic\".

I've posted on here regarding my sister before, however i feel this one may be important.I (15f) am friends with someone ill call Johnny, (15M) and my sister (14f) pretends to be his friend but doesn't really like him. We usually sit together in one class, photography. We used to sit at a different table but my sister begged me to move because he made an off comment. My sister didn't speak with him about it nor did she express a boundary against it so he came and sat with us at this table as well.He has made a few odd comments (examples like \"Gyatt\") and has made physical contact with her (touching her hand when she was zoned out to see if she was okay, hugging her after helping her not get hit by a bike) and these make my sister uncomfortable however she is adamant about not telling him. I've told her that I would tell him for her but she begged me not to and claimed that she's afraid of confrontation and doesn't like setting boundaries.A really important thing to note is, Johnny shows a lot of symptom's of autism and is currently in the process of getting a diagnosis. This is important because he has a hard time with social cues, one such example in this is him not getting she's uncomfortable, and this is amplified by her pretending that she's his friend + she refuses to talk to him about it.The part that really upsets me is that she constantly complains about Johnny's actions and Johnny in general, and also really wants me to move tables with her again still doesn't want to express this to him.WIBTA if I told Johnny my sisters boundaries?TLDR; Friend makes sister uncomfortable, sister doesn't want to tell him but doesn't want me to either and badmouths him for it.",
