	"title" : "AITA Monthly Open Forum, January 2024: Rule 1 - No Armchair Diagnoses",
	"body" : "New year, who dis?Oh! Dis Rule 1, our old friend. We’ve reviewed Rule 1 before but we had some requests to dive a little deeper, specifically with regard to armchair diagnoses. So let’s do this.As you know, Rule 1 is “Be Civil.” Armchair diagnoses, i.e. telling someone they have a mental disorder of some sort, are not civil. There’s a couple of reasons for that. One is that usually it’s clearly intended as an insult. That’s uncivil at face value, but also it’s really fucking messed up to use a condition that millions of people suffer from as an insult. Another reason is that you don’t have the doctorate needed to diagnose anyone with anything. No, put your hand down, we don’t believe you. And finally, even if you did have that degree, there’s no possible way for you to accurately diagnose anyone based on a few thousand characters in a reddit post. Which is, incidentally, why it would be unethical for qualified people to do so, which you’d know if you actually did have the credentials.So how does this play out in the comments? Claiming that “(person X) is a narcissist/autistic/etc.” is a classic example of violating this part of the rule. No matter how much experience you may have with someone in your real life that is actually (fill in the blank condition), you can NOT diagnose someone as such based on a Reddit post. You may relate your experiences to another user, but that’s about it. In short, OP isn't here for a medical diagnosis and AITA isn't here to provide it.Another common violation we see that’s related to all of this is usage of the R-slur. Yes, calling someone a “retard”, or any variation thereof, is absolutely uncivil. That includes versions such as “fucktard, libtard” or any other cross-breed word that one may dream up. There’s more info here on why this is a slur, and we’re not accepting arguments on this point. Using it will result in you being banned from this subreddit permanently and reported to reddit for hate.So why are we discussing this? We’re asking you to judge actions, not the whole person. Making a diagnosis is inherently judging the whole person. It doesn’t treat them with respect, give them an alternate perspective, or do anything to help them grow. We’re not here for you to get your jollies by insulting people, and we never will be.We always need US overnight time mods. Currently, we could also benefit from mods who can be active during peak \"bored at work\" hours, i.e. US morning to mid-afternoon.You need to be able to mostly mod from a PC. Mobile mod tools are improving and trickling in, but are not quite there yet.You need to be at least 18.You have to be an active AITA participant with multiple comments in the past few months.We'd also like to highlight the regional spinoffs we have linked on the sidebar! If you have any suggestions or additions to this, please let us know in the comments.",

	"title" : "AITA for not wanting to go back home to take care of my sick mom after her and her boyfriend kicked me out the day after my high school graduation last year?",
	"body" : "It was the day after graduation when my mom and her boyfriend told me that now that i was an adult, I had to move out and find a place of my own. Although it was unexpected,my mom and I's relationship changed drastically when her new boyfriend moved in. I tried to make a good impression because I wanted her to be happy but the guy just seemed to have an issue with me. He convinced my mom to start charging me rent because I had a part time job while still in school even though he was jobless and living off my mom.He would go in my room, go through my stuff and use some of my things without my permission. He even broke my laptop after using it without asking but my mom saw nothing wrong with his behaviour and always took his side. She would yell at me whenever I complained about how I didn't like him invading my privacy. He seemed very pleased with himself when my mom kicked me out.I didn't have enough to get a place so I survived by sleeping on friends couches as much as I could until they got tired of me and I had to sleep outside at times. Thankfully I was able to get a second job through someone I knew and I was able to save up and I just moved into a new place at the beginning of this month after months of not having anywhere to call home.A few days ago my mom's boyfriend reached out to me. Apparently my mom had a stroke and he tried guilting me into moving back to help her out because he got a job opportunity and has to move. I declined and told him that unfortunately I'm too busy trying to be an adult, it doesn't look like I can take time off that schedule to do that then hung up.",

	"title" : "AITA for refusing to turn my heat down further to make my upstairs neighbor comfortable?",
	"body" : "I, (45M) and my wife (42F); live in a house converted into an apartment. We’ve lived here for 6 years, have had two really good neighbors and then there’s the current one. We try to be good neighbors. We live on the first floor, the neighbor lives on the second. Each apartment is a separate unit with its own bathroom, kitchen, living room, electric bill, water bill, trash etc. Each unit has its own heater/thermostat which is where this issue arises.Last week where we live, the temperature dropped into single negative numbers during the day, double negative at night along with 13” of snow. My wife and I were reasonably cold so I turned our heat up to 72 from 68 degrees(f) Things were going well for that week and the temperatures began to rise again; so I turned the heat down to 70.Two days ago, the temperature high was 29 (it felt like 25) so I left the heat at 70. Our upstairs neighbor (F - I honestly don’t know her age but I guess around 35-40?) knocked on our door and asked us to turn down our heat because her apartment was 76 degrees. I apologized and agreed to lower it back down to 68. Later that evening, there was another knock on our door and it was her again, saying her apartment was still hot (she even brought her thermometer down) and requested that we turn our heat down further. I told her that we had our heat to 68 already but we would turn it down to 66. She didn’t say anything but went back upstairs. My wife and I slept under two blankets.Yesterday, there was a note on our door from her stating that she’s been nice in asking us to turn down the heat. That her apartment is still at 74 degrees and it’s too hot for her to sleep. She, again, wants the heat lowered and said she would be comfortable if her apartment was at 68 - 70.Here’s where I might be the asshole. I wrote my own note stating “Dear neighbor, I have complied twice with your requests and that’s not good enough for you. If you haven’t noticed, we have snow on the ground and it’s still in the low 20s and 30s because… it’s winter time. If you’re still hot in your apartment, perhaps YOU should turn down your own heat, buy a fan or open a few windows. My wife and I will NOT freeze ourselves to make YOU comfortable. Our temperature will remain at 69 until the winter is over and spring returns. Do not knock and do not put any more notes on our door. This matter is settled.” And placed it on her door.This morning, around 5; she was being extra loud (stomping, slamming doors) and when I started to head to work; she called me an asshole before getting into her own car.So Reddit, AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for refusing my SIL in her request to baptize her child during our wedding?",
	"body" : "I dated my fiance for five years before we tied the knot. I have a great relationship with his parents and siblings....except one of his sisters. The Golden Child of the family. She's annoying, but whatever it's fine, I've been able to keep out of her way for the most part as her family lives out of state.So my boyfriend and I got engaged and everything is going great planning with both sides of the family. Until SIL at the last minute requests that she and her family baptize their daughter during our ceremony! She'd even called our priest and he'd agreed to combine the ceremonies! Ummm, What?  I said no for several reasons - none of which were good enough, and I was apparently being \"unreasonable and selfish.\"My reasons:-We're Catholic and weddings are usually an hour, tacking on a baptism would either make the ceremony longer OR take time away from our ceremony.-Our wedding was an evening affair and the reception was only going to be about 2 hours so even if it lasted 30 min (baptism and their photos afterwards) that would cut our reception down to an hour and a half. (Her wedding/reception was an all day affair FYI)-The baby would be in the church, in the wedding photos, and at the reception so seriously who would focus on another wedding couple when there's a first grandchild nearby?Her reasoning:-All the family would already be gathered (for our wedding) and it'd be a good time for them (her family) to have it. And shouldn't I be accommodating to a first time mother!!!!-They'd only invite about 4-6 additional people (to our wedding) ((strangers to us)) and it'd be easier on them because we'd already have the venue and food for their short guest list (((which we'd be paying for))).-It's the fist grandchild and important to the HER family (I guess I wasn't a part of it yet and not included in this sentiment?)My fiance didn't have a strong preference either way but supported how I felt on the matter. I stuck to my guns and said no but we offered a compromise. We said we'd DELAY our honeymoon trip and they could have the baptism the next Sunday morning during Mass. I thought it was a great compromise! But SIL was not thrilled. So that's what we ended up doing but she still brought baby girl, in full white satin lace, to the wedding and was front and center in all the photos. And they brought their 4-6 extra friends to our reception without asking first. We never made a fuss about it.My issue is this, I STILL get crap from this SIL and it's been a couple years since the wedding. Snippy remarks made when it's only the two of us around, passive aggressive comments in front of others, Bridezilla labels tossed my way, a cold shoulder when I try to talk to her at holidays, etc. Like seriously, it was years ago and she basically got what she wanted so why am I being treated like I was an AH? AITA??Edit to address repeated questions:When this first came up, I said no. My husband took over handling this completely from there. He worked with his mom and sister. I didn't have to deal with anything besides initially saying no - husband was point of contact after that. Granted we didn't know she'd still show up with her guests to the reception (or knew what her daughter was dressed in) but at that point we were having a good time at our reception and were focusing on ourselves. I only figured out she'd invited her friends when I saw the photos later. I don't know if she ever offered to pay because I wasn't in the conversation at this point. It happened right before our wedding and hubs and MIL didn't want me to stress out.It was a short evening reception with a buffet. We had about 200 people total.Her passive aggressive comments in the following years were very subtle. If she said something rude and if I or my husband called her out on it (which he did ) she'd claim we simply misunderstood her. The rude comments or snubs she gave me directly in private she'd also claim I misunderstood her - or was blowing an innocent comment out of proportion. My husband has stood up for me but our interactions with her are brief and only once or twice a year so I'm not dedicating a lot of time to trying to have a great relationship with her. She's a narcissist and I REFUSE to give her any drama to feed her addiction.It just struck me as odd that she's hung onto this incident for so long and I began to question if I might have inadvertently been the A hence this post.",

	"title" : "AITA for telling my mother she hasn't been my mom since I was 5 and I don't owe her anything?",
	"body" : "When I (24f) was 5 my mother had her second child, my sister. We have different dad's and neither was involved when we were kids. My sister was born prematurely and this is when my mother went from being my mom to being an almost stranger to me. She spent all her time at the hospital with my sister and I was passed around from friends to family and even to strangers my mother and I didn't know, because an aunt would hand me over to someone in her husband's family or a family friend would pass me onto their friend.My sister was in the hospital for months and had many complications from being born so early. So was one of the youngest preemies in the hospital's history. When she started to get strong enough to go home complications due to her stomach were found and that required more time and more treatments. My mother was in and out of the hospital with her for the next couple of years as they performed surgeries and gave treatments when she would get sick. At that point even when my mother was home with my sister she would keep me somewhere else normally and the times I was home with her I was left alone and her focus was my sister.Then when my sister was two she was diagnosed with leukemia and that resulted in more treatments, more hospital visits and just never ever seeing them. By the time I was 10 my mother was okay leaving me at home while they were at the hospital so I was alone. It was around this time that my teachers started to suggest I might have dyslexia and the school reacted out to my mother but she was too focused on my sister to do anything for me.Nothing changed after my sister became cancer free and she was less sick and needed the hospital less. My mother was so devoted to her that she didn't pay attention to me and both were strangers to me.I started staying with my girlfriend's family as a teenager and my mother didn't care. I would only go back to her house when I needed to pick up more of my clothes or stuff. And when I turned 18 I moved out officially and got my dyslexia diagnosis.Now several years on I don't really have anything to do with my mother or my sister. I don't blame my sister for any of this. It's just no bond could form when we were younger and she's a stranger to me. My mother has started to have some health problems and turned to me for help. She told me I should be around more and doing stuff to help her because she's my mom. She also said my sister deserves a relationship with me and accused me of punishing my sister for existing. I told her that wasn't true but we were strangers and that was because of her (my mother). I also told her she hadn't been my mom since I was 5 and she had no right to ask me to care for her when she hasn't cared for me in almost 20 years. She called me a selfish and spoiled child who never grew up.AITA?",

I did not want it to be financially draining for anyone so bought all their bridesmaid’s dresses. One of my childhood best friends (let’s cal her Lea) was also my bridesmaid. I had switched three flights to be there for her wedding and then return just the day after as I was not able to take time off work but did all my bridesmaids duty and maid sure I was there for her wedding no matter what. But when it came for the time of my wedding she wasn’t getting very involved in the planning but would leave random messages to me from time to time to show her excitement. I just assumed that she was really busy and did not think much of it. I was a bit shocked and hurt when she did not show up for my bachelorette. My sister and my MOH told me that she had asked each and everyone of my bridesmaids about their date of convenience and budget before planning my bachelorette and Lea had confirmed her presence but dropped out last minute saying she had an important work meeting. I believed her till I found out that she was actually out on a cousins trip on the same date. This really pissed me off and I confronted her. She never gave a proper explanation and just became really defensive. I left the matter there as I did not want to ruin my wedding and chose to give her the benefit of the doubt. I had a grand music night a day before my wedding. She was there for it and everything seems normal. The next day in the morning when I called all my bridesmaids to my room for the final bridal entry practice, I found out that Lea had already left because she needed to attend another wedding. I was very upset. I was anyway in the bridal mode and it really effected my mood. I also had to make some last minute changes to the bridal entry. Later when I confronted her after the wedding, she wasn’t apologetic at all. She simply told me that she had to also attend her husband’s cousins wedding and since she was already there for one wedding related event it shouldn’t be a big deal that she missed my actual wedding since I would anyway be busy on the day of my wedding and wouldn’t get time to interact with anyone. I asked her why she did not tell me earlier, I wouldn’t have bought her the bridesmaid dress and wouldn’t have planned things keeping her in mind. She said that she did not want to upset me and thought it’s best if she leaves without telling anyone so that she is not “emotionally manipulated” into staying. Since then I have been avoiding her. I had a lot of love for her but I just feel so betrayed that all the love seems to have evaporated. Some people things that I am being petty and I should just forgive her. So, AITA?",

The company he was working for went under, I had to go from a SAHM to working overtime because he had an incredibly hard time finding anything else. We have 3 kids. (4M, 2M, and 1F.)We ended up having to move back to our home state, and back in with my parents for a few weeks until our new home was ready. In the few weeks that we stayed my mother splurged on our kids. She bought them clothes, children furniture (bunk bed, and playpen.) All in all, if I had to estimate how much she spent on our kids, I would probably guess she spent $1200. Then Christmas came, and she splurged even more on my kids toys (I would estimate $500 for all the toys she bought them.)My mom came to me a week ago saying she believes it's only fair she claims one of my children on her taxes as a dependent so she recieves the money for it and it would make us even. I was shocked. I'm not comfortable with anyone, not even my own mother, having my kid's information. I told her that as well and she got angry with me, pointing out all the things she had bought for my children and how it was the least we could do for \"traumatizing her with our children during our stay.\"I told my mother I wouldn't allow it, but she was more than welcome to total everything up and I would give her the money myself. She refused and insisted on claiming one of my children. The more I think about the whole situation the more I don't even want to pay her back. Me and my husband didn't ask for or even need ANY of the things she bought. Not to mention she's wanting us to pay her back for the Christmas presents she bought for the kids.So reddit, AITA for not wanting to pay my parents back?EDIT #1: I didn't put this at first because I didn't think it was relevant.

	"body" : "So I have been a long time lurker but this is my first time writing a post here. So this happened when I was catching my train. Due to severe winters, a lot of flights are getting cancelled and people are turning towards trains to travel. So I was also one of those people. I was outside the railway station and in line to get my luggage checked by security. Mind you that there is a huge queue and the line is almost 500m long. My turn was next and I was about to put my luggage on the carousel for checking, suddenly two women (in their 50s I guess, don’t come for me) and their daughter (who by the way was same age as me) start putting there luggage and start pushing us away. I tried to get their attention and said excuse me but I was ignored. So I tapped on one of the women’s shoulder and said that there is a long queue and you should follow that. She started being overtly sweet with me and was like our train is in half an hour and blah blah. I was thinking that if they would have been in queue they could have easily caught their train but if they go back now they will miss it. I was about to let them go before me but then suddenly the daughter goes in a very loud voice “LET HER GO”, while looking at me. I was shocked as she was getting angry as if I was inconveniencing her and had cut in line. People started looking at me and the little kindness I had in me vanished. I felt bad for her mother as she was being sweet to me but her daughter was being an entitled b. I got so pissed at her entitlement that I replied in equally loud voice “what an entitled person. May be don’t shout at people who are considering helping you.” She was like yeah yeah. I didn’t say anything to her and turned to her mother that I am sorry but your daughter needs to learn how to be polite to people when asking for favour. I then turned around and let the security personnel know that they had cut a huge line. The security guy took them aside and made them wait for 15 mins (so that they don’t miss their train, otherwise they would have gone to the end of the queue). I moved forward and passed security. The family in front of me turn around and said you could have let them go and didn’t have to be so rude. The older guy scoffed and was like youngsters while looking at me. Was I the A***ole?ETA I have read everyone’s opinion and I realise that I should never be kind to others at the expense of someone else. Next time if I want to be kind I will keep this in mind. On other note many redditors are commenting that I was being kind and inconveniencing other people. Actually those three ladies had to cross the whole queue and everyone knew that they were rushing to cut the line but not a single person said anything. I was the only one who actually spoke up. However lesson learnt. Those who are curious, I am not from a western country.",

Cheers)I (M38) and my wife (F37) got into a (little) argument last week. She is going soon for a 3 weeks trip to the US (We are European) for some research studies in a prestigious school (unpaid and outside her work scope). I pushed her to take this opportunity and instead, will take care of the 2 boys back home (and just for the record, as I start seeing that people believe men don't take care of kids... where we live, I took more paternity leave and do most of the activities with them as I enjoy. So this not me being scared being with my boys :D).After these 3 weeks, I expected my wife to fly back directly to us. However, she asked me if she could fly to New York and visit the city for 3 days. She said it is her childhood dream and does not know if the opportunity will present itself again. I have told her that this is also a dream of mine and I would have liked to experience it with her, but now I will not.While she was talking about it, I felt really disappointed and sad that she would not like to come back asap to her family. I told her I disagree and I do not want her to fly to New York but instead fly back to us. She refused and said that she will book the tickets anyway.We are used to travel often for work (2-3 days) and we always take one extra day to visit. However, I just felt that this time 3 weeks is not 2-3 days.In some way, I feel angry at myself for thinking that my wife is selfish, but at the same time I believe I should not interfere with her dream. However,  I cannot stop thinking that I would not have behaved this way, especially after 3 weeks.I have now asked her to unbook her tickets, or else I will also book a 3 week trip abroad by myself when she is coming back.

	"body" : "Longtime lurker here.I (M48) and my wife Anne (F47) live by ourselves; our kids have both moved out. I’m the breadwinner and Anne the SAHM; now she’s the housewife after our youngest moved out last year.What’s changed is that she says she’s ‘owed’ for raising our kids and taking care of the household. She wants more personal time, less work around the house, and so I’ve basically taken over almost all the housework, cooking three meals, cleaning the house. I’m still working a full-time job, and I never slacked on chores that I did, such as the gardening, hard-lifting, etc., and I was never an absent father.I bore with it for the past year, but she’s gotten more abusive, outright berating me in front of the kids when they visit that I’m only good for my strength and don’t think about the household at all, while she is doing less of the household work. It’s gotten to the point that I just want to relax in the car for a good solid minute because I only know there’s a long list of things to do.Last night, she went out with her friends, while I slept early for work. This morning, I looked for the car keys for over 30 minutes, which were not in the drawer we always put them in. I woke her up to ask where she put, and she just grumbled at me to find them myself before going back to sleep. I ended up finding it in her handbag and got to work late.I got home today to her screaming at me for invading her privacy by going through her handbag. I tried to tell her that she told me to find them myself, but she kept cutting me off saying I should have known better than to dig through her personal belongings. That she has rights, and I should respect them and to wait for her to wake before getting her to find the keys herself.It was when she said she didn’t care if I was late to work that I lost it. Her exact line was, “It’s not like we’re needing that stupid money anymore.” I yelled back at her that she was entitled and selfish, and that the only reason she’s able to enjoy her current time is because of my stupid money. That she’s been having it far too easy the past year, and if she wanted to see what she’s owed, she can go back to either working, or doing all the chores she’s dumped on me.Anne was shell-shocked that I yelled back at her. The rest of the night was quiet, and she locked herself in our bedroom and hasn’t come out. I’ve called our kids, and told them what happened. My daughter agrees with me, but son says that I may have been too harsh to call her entitled, and implied that I undermined her efforts all those years as a SAHM. They’re going to take turns calling Anne, but I now wonder if I may have been overboard with yelling at her about taking it too easy.Daughter has suggested couple therapy, and said that she’s going to suggest it to Anne as well. I’m more than willing to do so, as today’s encounter made me reflect that I’m getting extremely tired and weary of this life.",

	"body" : "Me and my best friend have regular video calls because we live in different states.We mostly have a call when my boyfriend is not around (I live with him), sometimes he is at home tho.When we video call, she sometimes undress herself, like changing clothes or when she feels too hot. She is not completely naked, but in underwear like panties or bra or sports bra.After the third time I told her not to do that because sometimes my boyfriend could walk past by.She said why? He is not there anyways. And I told her he is. She then said, its not a big problem, he would see her like this on the beach as well. I told her well its not the same and told her not to do that anymore.She used to do that too when I was living alone, which was fine for me, but now I am living with my boyfriend its something else.Also I told her she should always assume he is there even though he most of the time isnt, but I am not going to make an announcement everytime we talk, if he is there or not. Its not hard to turn the camera while dressing, what most people doShe said I am overreacting. I think I am not. I am requesting something really normal and she shouldnt do that regardless.AITA?Forgot to add: She asked me if I was jealous if my boyfriend would see her like this and undressing. I said no, its just normal not to do that.Edit: I read some of the comments by now and I find it super interesting to hear different opinions.First of all, yes I could have just turn off the camera by myself or switched to phone call. She undresses herself randomly without any warning and sometimes I just do stuff on the side, where there is no chance I can turn the screen immediately down or so.About the jealousy thing. That is not my point at all. When I lived by myself of course I wouldnt have a problem with her randomly undressing since there is only both of us and we are comfortable with each other. Now I am living with someone else, which is my partner, I also have to consider about him and it doesnt matter if its my boyfriend, my parents, my siblings or even another girl friend of mine. Not everyone wants to see someone undress and half naked. If I put this situation on me, I would never change my clothes in front of the camera, when I am not sure or clearly know that my friends boyfriend (or anyone else, her friend, parents etc.) are around and there could be a chance that they get a glimpse of me. For me that is not a normal thing to do. I just thought that also occurred to her when I moved out, that now we are not only two people here.About the that she is in her home, she can do whatever she wants. Yes, she can. But she doesnt need to do it in the video call. If shes at home naked all day I dont care, but if she lives on ground floor and has the window wide open, where everybody can see her naked. That is an issue.Last thing about the bikini. For me its not the same. Just because my colleagues and boss saw me in bikini before for whatever reason, doesnt mean that I need to show up like this to work. I guess that is just personal opinions.In the future I would consider phone calls over video calls, even tho we do prefer video calls.Thanks for all the imput.",

	"title" : "AITA for refusing to give my autistic friend a lift in my car",
	"body" : "My friend and I have been friends since 3rd year high school and we are both now in our early 30s. I have been driving for 12 years and have always been happy to give friends and family a lift in my car if they struggle to get from A to B.My friend is autistic but still functional and is able to get public transport if need be and gets free bus travel and discounted rail travel because of her condition.For years I have given her a lift to and from her house, if we go on a day trip I’ll drive us there and back usually totalling in an hour long round trip etc.Over the past several years it has bothered me that she never offers to pay/split petrol or even offer to pay for parking for me doing all the driving. Me, her and 4 other friends (3 drivers, 3 non-drivers) were planning a trip into the capital (40mins there and back so 80mins round trip), and agreed to split the passengers evenly between 2 cars and decided to split the petrol bills evenly between passengers. When I said this to my friend she acted as though she didn’t need to pay and started arguing why she thought the split cost was too high and started comparing the price to how much her sister pays on fuel to the capital and back. I did explain that normally it’s good manners to split petrol costs and it’s not fair to expect to be chauffeured around for free all the time. Also petrol costs differ from car to car and depends on weight of passengers etc.We ended up not driving and got the train into the capital instead. Most likely a return ticket cost the same if not a little more than the initial shared petrol cost of £5 each.Basically I’ve stopped offering to give her lifts as I feel she isn’t paying her way and I don’t know if she doesn’t understand because of her autism or if she isn’t use to having to pay her way in life as she still lives with parents, had little to no bills to pay and has never had a job in her life and has always been on benefits for disability. Also her mum drives her most places if she can so she’s use to living an easy life.I feel this is a reasonable thing to ask if you are driving someone anywhere that isn’t local. Splitting petrol costs are the norm between driver and passengers and I explained that is what you’re doing when you pay to use public transport (more or less) so why is she unhappy to do it with friends?AITA and being unreasonable now that I have stopped giving her lifts in my car?",

	"body" : "I have 4 older brothers. My eldest one married Amy. Amy’s really nice and sweet but my mom is very meh towards her.This is because our family is very religious and Amy’s family follows a different religion. They’re both Abrahamic religions so mom eventually accepted her but it’s also because she believed that Amy could be converted. The thing with Amy though is that while she does believe in her family’s religion, she isn’t religious at all and doesn’t really care for it.She doesn’t say anything when we go to church or talk about religion, but she doesn’t participate either.Anyways, my brother and Amy told us they’re pregnant. We’re all very excited for them and mom even started to be kinder to Amy.We found out it’s going to be a boy and my mom’s been looking at boy names for ideas. The thing is, they’re all very stereotypically Christian… if that makes sense. Not any names that are like popular/common but those super old fashioned ones. Even I think those names are a bit much…I told my mom to maybe look at a top 100/200 list but she told me to stop being silly.Well, my brother told us the baby’s name and his first name is a popular American name and the middle name is from Amy’s culture/religion. The first thing my mom asked was why they couldn’t give him a name that’s more Christian/traditional but my brother just said the kid will have our last name so a more “neutral” first name with a middle name from his wife’s culture makes sense. Mom said “i’ll let it go this time, but I’m naming your next child.” She was “joking” but my brother said “yeah not gonna happen, we’re naming all our kids like that.”He then hung up on her.Mom was really mad and kept saying this is why she disapproved of their marriage and that he should’ve married a nice Christian girl instead. That this (hypothetical) girl would’ve taken her suggestions. I told mom to get over herself and find a hobby. This upset her and she got mad at me for implying that she’s doing something wrong when she’s trying to be an involved grandmother/parent. I told her that no one wants her help and she started to cry… yeah. I really do think she needs a hobby but I guess she isn’t being harmful. And my brother already told her off so I suppose I was being a bit obnoxious. She won’t talk to me anymore so AITA?",

	"body" : "For those of you who have not parenting in a while, all doctors strongly recommend putting babies to sleep on their back, without pillows or blankets. This significantly lowers the chances of accidental suffocation / SIDS.  In fact, the hospital made my husband and I sign a form stating that they had informed us of this fact.When my older child was a baby, my mom would wrap him in blankets and put him face down EVERY time she watched him.  I was in tears, begging her to be safe with him. She just said “all my kids lived” and told me that if I don’t trust her to watch the baby then don’t have her watch him.  I eventually stopped having her watch him until he was much older.Now I just had my second child and my mother offered to take the kids overnight to give us a break. I told her I would not be able to sleep knowing the baby is not safe, so I will just keep them at home. My mom is offended and angry. She is saying that I am ridiculous and being very mean to her when she is just trying to help. I told her she was very clear that my choices are either Iet her be unsafe with the baby or not have her watch them.  I just can’t relax knowing my baby is not in a safe space, so what other choice do I have?  My dad is on my moms side and is rolling his eyes and calling me overprotective, my husband is on my side and says there is no reason she can’t change her behavior to keep our children safe.So, am I the asshole for not letting my mom watch the baby when I think she is being unsafe?",

At 9:45PM, J tells us to arrive later, because dinner is still going. But we’re almost there after one hour of public transport, so we still arrive at 10PM.The dessert isn’t served, main dishes leftover are on the table, people are not eating anymore. We greet everyone and J brings some chairs for us to sit at the table. P goes to the garden for a smoke, K and I sit next to M’s friends. They serve us some wine and we talk for a bit. One of them asks if we want some of the leftover duck in front of us, I decline saying we already ate beforehand. They ask us again 4 times and I end up accepting. I tell K to try some as I know J’s mom’s Peking duck is very tasty. We each eat around 4 slices. Meanwhile, 2 of my friends arrive and smoke outside waiting for dinner to end.Then, J’s mom sits to have a toast with M’s friend and I ask for a glass. I didn’t know but it is a premium wine a friend of M brought as a gift. I brought a bottle too, I thought it was fine.Around 11PM some family members leave. There’re only M’s friends, our friends, two cousins and us. Our friends are sitting on the other side of the table.One cousin is a pastry chef, he brought a handmade king cake. They cut the cake and some get a slice, including P. Two of our friends decline.Karaoke starts, we sing for a bit. There’re still 3 slices of king cake left, I want to ask for one. I tell K, she says “I got it, follow me”. However, once next to the plate she notices she’s in front of the TV displaying the karaoke. So she proceeds to directly take the plate in front of M, brushes her without noticing, and brings it next to my friends. We sit down to eat a slice each. Just after we finish eating, M comes and says “It was for family only”. We both are feeling so ashamed. When I saw K take the plate I found it a bit strange but nothing alarming.When I finally get to talk to J, I apologize for the king cake, he tells me smiling that K and I are stupid and we move on.The party keeps going and ends without trouble.2 weeks later, I get to see J (w/o K) for the first time since NYE. He tells me he never felt so ashamed to invite friends, his family saw us eating duck but his mom didn’t invite us to eat it. She was a bit angry that I asked to toast with her and M’s friends and the king cake was the cherry on top, we didn’t ask and stole it.He says his family will laugh at him for years because of this.He says he never wants to see K again and he’s really disappointed in me.I apologized for the king cake but not for the duck nor the toast as I feel like neither K nor I made a mistake here.K wants to write an apology letter along with a gift for this incident but is waiting for my approval.",

The excitement from us and my family was through the roof. We could not wait to start wedding planning and got to it almost immediately.One of the biggest decisions you have to make when planning a wedding is who is going. From the beginning my fiancé decided on a black tie formal themed wedding. I was all for it that’s just type of girl she is and I wouldn’t expect anything less. Now what comes with a formal event like that is the audience. My family and extended family is very close knit. We have many large family gatherings throughout the year. We have had two wedding before our engagement on my side. For both weddings kids were not invited unless in the wedding. This where my problem starts.Me and fiancé decided on not having kids from the very beginning. My mother insisted that we would not exclude my aunts children who the oldest is a freshman in Highschool. The youngest is in the sixth grade. I never agreed to it with my mother and we had posted no children and adults only on our wedding website. My fiancé side of the family understood this decision without any question.We addressed my aunt and husband with just them on the save the date. We are at the home stretch of our wedding planning. Invites go out in 9 weeks. We had another family sit down and my mother berated me about not including the kids. Stating “that’s all I asked for” when I have accommodated everyone of her friends and husbands to our wedding. She threatened that my aunt will not go if the kids are not invited.I decided on reaching out to my aunt to clarify the confusion about her kids and stuck to the decision we made to not have kids. She did not respond instead called my mother and the berated ensued after again. The amount of guilt I have personally felt along with stress has made this part of the wedding planning miserable.Three days go by and I receive and text from my aunt stating; “ that excluding family due to age is an act of ageism and is as offensive as excluding someone of race, sexual orientation or political orientation.” And that they will not be attending. Wow. I have yet to respond but in my gut that response tells me everything I need to know to not invite them to the wedding . AITA?",

I paid for her ticket and left our 6 year old with a friend.We were slightly rushed as we made it to the airport a little late and weren't sure about the lines at security.Unfortunately for my wife once we crossed security, the heel on her boot broke. I don't know why but she insists on wearing heels everywhere and was all dressed up for this trip. Like not completely broken but would completely fold outward so she had to walk on tip toe.Unfortunately there weren't too many shops and the shops we found was rather expensive.Most of the women's shoes were weird looking but she liked one pair of heeled boots. However it was around $350 which while I could afford it, it didn't seem reasonable to me. We were already near the gate so I suggested looking again at our layover airport in Europe.Unfortunately we had the same problem there, while there were more shops many of them were closed and the one open shop we found in out terminal had even more outrageous prices of around 400€.Eventually I just told her to wait until we arrived and she changed her shoes when we picked our checked bags.AITA here? She is a SAHM so she doesn't have her own money and after the cost of flights, and paying my friend to babysit we'd already spent more than usual. She seemed to handle it fine, just had to walk on tip toe and put less pressure on the broken heel and I carried the heavier cabin luggage.

They’re always ‘fighting’ (jokingly), steal eachothers shit etc. When they were younger, Riley did used to pick on Adam but my wife and i resolved it.For the past year or so, they’ve really gotten closer. Adam has always been a quiet child and Riley is the textbook extrovert and he’s really helped his younger brother come out of his shell. Adam has a twin sister, Kate, who is equally as extroverted as Riley but i think that gaining that bond with his older brother is what helped him change. Growing up, Adam and Kate fell into the ‘loud twin and quiet twin’ roles so i think his new closeness with Riley is what helped.A few weeks ago, Riley asked me if he could take Adam with him on a weekend trip with his friends who are all 22-26. Now, when i was younger, i used to take my younger brother on trips with my friends but we only have a 3 year age gap, not 8. And my younger brother was not as anti-social as Adam tends to get. Plus, sometimes the boys take it too far when messing with each other and my wife and i have to intervene before they actually get upset with each other.As much as i love Riley, he is also not the type of person you can entrust a person to—i wouldn’t even trust him with a goldfish. He’s the type of person who forgets to eat and take meds and Adam is hypoglycemic and because of his social anxiety, I don’t think he’d take himself to the kitchen in the apartment they’ll be renting for the trip if there are other people there. I’d maybe feel safer if Kate went too, but i don’t want to send my daughter on a trip with a bunch of guys.For these reasons, i said no and i told them why in a watered down way. He accused me of not trusting him and Adam to behave themselves and is currently very upset with me. Adam is also pretty annoyed with me for ‘treating him a child’.

She asked me to take a beginners class with her starting after the new year even though I’ve had some experience in the past. It is 6 weeks of 12 classes for $130 meeting at specific times. Our first two weeks of classes(2 classes a week) were mostly fine but Kat is really competitive and doesn’t like being the one that needs extra help at the gym however she was tolerating the investment.Classes are paid for on top of gym fees up front with no refunds even after missing a class.The incident happened in our fifth class. I had to bring my baby (7 months). Over the years I’ve seen women bring babies after hours at times so it wasn’t entirely abnormal, mine was in his carrier asleep along the wall for the beginning of class but he woke up toward the end and earned himself a lot of attention.One of the younger gals(Early 20s) was “uncomfortable being so dressed down in front of a boy” wearing cheeky spanks and a sports bra. I told her she could wear more if she wanted. She argued back “or you could take him home so he’s not over here oogling us” I laughed as I told her with sarcasm “you’re more likely to get ogled by me than my baby.”That shut her up.Later Kat said she was embarrassed by the scene and wished I hadn’t come with my son in the first place sliding in a jab “it’s not like you need the class anyway.” This hurt me because when I was 18 my dad cut me off financially ‘for being gay’ and I put my gymnast/dance background to use dancing exotically. She knows it.So it actually hurt me and fairly deeply.I asked why she would say that and she said she was “so embarrassed” she no longer wants to go to class with me. I asked her again, why she was so embarrassed and she stated I ‘came out’. I didn’t. Yes she already knew I was married to a woman and no she never had a problem with it.I told her I’m not going to stop going when it’s already been paid for.

My SIL looked upset and said \"they MUST walk during the dinner reception too.\" Note that my wedding ceremony and dinner reception was at the same location and the wedding aisle was long (85ft long) so it takes some time to get from one end to the other (especially for kids).I am not the confrontational type, so I asked my husband to tell his sister that her daughters will only walk down the aisle once. My husband agreed and told his sister. My SIL disapproved and said to my husband that he is the kids' only beloved uncle and that her daughters will never get a chance to be flower girls again.I thought everything was sorted out... until the big day. The wedding ceremony went as should and the flower girls were so beautiful; however, when the dinner reception time came and my husband and my entrance to the dinner reception was about to happen, the SIL inserted her kids in front of us with fresh baskets of rose petals. The SIL never told me nor my husband about this entrance.I was blindsided. Turns out that my SIL went behind my back and told my MOH to tell the wedding MC (emcee) to announce the flower girls first to the dinner reception. The flower girls entered the dinner reception laying out a fresh set of rose petals down the aisle once more. While I was surprised, I was not angry (nor sad) because it was a special day and I did not want to let bad emotions ruin the day. I was also going to let the MC introduce and thank the flower girls during the reception anyways, so I did not mind.This quickly changed when my SIL planned a surprise dance by the daughters in the middle of dinner as a gift to us. The MC once again announced the flower girls and they started dancing down the aisle onto the main stage again. So, all in all the kids \"walked\" down the aisle not once, not twice, but three times! My husband and I were supposed to have our first dance during this time, but instead her daughters danced on the stage, while my husband and I had our first dance on the side...After the wedding I told my husband how upset I was at his sister and said she was trying to make the day about her kids. I confronted my SIL about this, but she shrugged it off and said that they were just kids and I am being a bridezilla/an a-hole. Instead my husband apologized on her behalf, which angered me more since it was not his fault.AITA for confronting my SIL that she was trying to make our wedding a showcase for her kids?",

	"body" : "I have been with my husband for 3 and a half years and married just over 1 year. This past November we had our first child. My husband is an only child and his father was never in the picture. Him and his mom have never really been close.Now for a little back story, we are both at odds with my MIL and it all started less than 24 hours after I had my son. My husband and I told both my MIL and my mother that we did not want our son's birth turned into a photo op. People taking pictures of me have always made me uncomfortable. My son had some complications immediately after he was born and he was rushed to the NICU. I wasn't able to see him for roughly 9 hours. Once I was allowed to go into the NICU my husband went with me as this was the first time I was officially meeting my newborn son. Next thing I know I look up and see my MIL using this opportunity as a photo op. I WAS FUMING. These were not the first pictures I wanted of my son or of my husband and I with our son. The next morning my MIL decided she wanted to come back and see our son who is now safe and in our room. I am running on maybe 2 hours of sleep, but still said it was okay for her to come. Once she was there I didn't really interact with her. I was just trying to rest. After she left she ended up calling my husband. This is when he decided to call her out on the photo op and how she completely violated a boundary that we clearly set.Her response floored me. She began yelling at my husband saying that I hate her, that I don't like her and I never have. That I am so hateful towards her. She said her reasoning for taking the pictures was because she thought that we would want to remember that moment and to her it wasn't a big deal and she didn't see the point of getting upset.Once all this happened I decided I needed to distance myself from her and focus on my new family. My husband agreed with doing this as well.Fast forward to about a week and a half ago. My husband and son had been sick for over a week. I was out doing errands and getting groceries. MIL asked me multiple times if I wanted anything from Sams Club. I would constantly tell her \"no, but thank you.\" She was doing the same to my husband and he would also respond \"no we are good thanks\". I return home and my son was screaming. He hadn't slept all day. We all decided to try to nap. My husband finally falls asleep and I finally get my son to fall asleep. About 10 minutes later there is a knock on my door. My dog goes flying and barking her head off waking up my son. I answer the door and say \"why are you here\". She says I wanted to bring you a rotisserie chicken, a trash can, and laundry detergent. I told her we already said we didn't want anything and to not show up at our house unannounced and that next time she tries to give us random crap I will immediately return it to her we don't want anything from her. She got angry and said \"she will never come over or speak to us again\" and slammed the door. AITA?",

We ended up separating and our daughter and I moved out of state. He agreed to this because he was planing on going into the Air-force and we both were working on ourselves to better a future relationship. Now that future relationships isn’t happening. Turns out he lied to me about wanting to go into the military, lied about that fact he stopped drinking and smoking and he lost interest in being a father. My daughter and I have been living out of state for a year now and he’s come to see her once for a week period. So the entire time she’s been three, he’s seen her for seven days. For the first seven months I would call every time our daughter asked and be started getting angry saying “you’re calling too much” so I stopped and started only calling for nap time and bed time. However that didn’t make him happy either. So I told him I tried but it’s not my responsibility to make you talk to her and if he wants to talk to her he can call. I still text him “nap” and “bed” and if he wants to talk to her, he’ll call. He refused to work all of 2023 except for Uber 2-3 days a week for 2-3 hours. While I found little jobs short term and have been trying really hard to find a good job. Two days ago him and I had a conversation about taxes. He wants to file and put our daughter on it to get the child tax credit. But because he is going to be owing taxes this year, he wouldn’t get the child, it will go to what he owes. I asked him to not put her on there so I can file and get the child tax credit since I have the child and he became enraged. He still wants to us it to go to what he owes the IRS rather then it going to things for our daughter. So would I be the AH if I filed for full custody making it where he can’t put her on there?Edit: our daughter is almost four but is the average height of a six year old. I am constantly having to buy new shoes, underwear, shirts and pants. She is also a really observant child and knows he doesn’t really want to show up or talk to her ( she knows cause he has said while knowing he’s on speaker and he can hear her). I want to do what’s best for my daughter. I want him to see her again but only when he actually wants to. He’s made it clear that rn he’s enjoying having zero responsibilities and living his life child free.",

	"body" : "Link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxj7e6/aita_for_abandoning_my_mil_in_a_parking_lot_full/Hi Reddit! Sorry this update took so long, but I just signed the last of the divorce papers and wanted to share with this sub. I took the top comment's advice and tried to have a conversation with my ex-husband and his mother, but they both just yelled at me and would not listen to anything I said. My ex-husband even went back on his agreement to not invite her over -- apparently, this was my punishment for disobeying him and embarrassing his mother.For a few months, I stayed with my best friend on the weekends, and she convinced me to divorce him. But because I was a SAHM, I needed a steady source of income. Early 2023, we started a candle making business on Etsy. It was really rough the first few months, but we began to gain traction and I finally told my ex that I wanted a divorce after I felt financially stable. He said no, but I had already worked everything out with my lawyer. After I sent him the papers, he and his mother began harassing me and he said that he would agree to the divorce only if I gave up full custody of my daughter. Long story short, this ended up in us going to court, and I now have full custody.My best friend is the real hero of this entire story -- she let me stay over for free throughout the proceedings and helped me care for my daughter. With the alimony and the money I made from the candle making business, I officially moved in with my best friend and began paying her rent, too. I'm currently saving up to buy a place of my own. My daughter and I are really happy right now, and I can't believe that I didn't see how toxic my ex and his mother were for the 7 years we were married. I hope this is enough drama for the rest of my life, and thanks to all the people in my dm's who showed me how toxic my relationship was!",

	"body" : "I do digital portraits, mostly as a hobby, but I have gotten a few commissions here and there. A while ago, my boyfriend and I were hanging out with mutual friends and my boyfriend suggested in front of everyone that I do a portrait as a gift for someone's upcoming birthday. While it was a little annoying to be volunteered by him, I did think it was a good gift idea and went ahead and did it. The next time a birthday in the group came up, my bf made the same suggestion and as a result \"the birthday portrait\" has kind of become my thing. My boyfriend will get something small as his gift since he views the portrait as being \"from us.\"The part where I may be the asshole here is that I haven't told him explicitly to stop volunteering me for these portraits. It is my fault for going along with the birthday gift thing for our friends without saying anything, but I kind of assumed that he would at least keep these requests within the realm of common sense.Well...his college buddy is getting married, and my boyfriend told him that I would make him a portrait of him and his bride as a wedding gift. I have never even met this person! To make matters worse, he apparently made this promise weeks ago but only told me about it today, and the wedding is this Saturday. I finally lost it at him and told him that I'm not his personal portrait sweatshop, and that he only does this because he's a cheapskate and it gets him out of spending any money on a gift, even though it costs me a lot of time.He argued back that a bespoke portrait is so much better than just buying something off the resume, that it's a generous thing for me to do, it helps build my portfolio, and that I don't get very many paid commissions anyway. For the record—I don't get many paid commissions because I don't charge peanuts for them. I have a full time job, so I price according to what would be worth giving up the amount of free time that it takes me.He told me that I put him in a really difficult position, that he hyped up the portrait, and they were both really looking forward to it. He said please just do this one and I won't ask again. I said no, I don't even know these people, this is so not my problem.He looked up a couple of portrait artists online, but none of them were willing to do the piece on the short turnaround he needed + at the quality he wanted + at the price he was willing to pay. He even tried using an AI image generator—which was a complete slap in the face to me as an artist—but all of the outputs were very obviously AI. He's begging me to please just do this one and he will make it up to me on my birthday, but (especially after he apparently thought my work was so worthless that it could be effortlessly reproduced by a machine), I'm just really not in the mood.",

Prior to booking the holiday I spoke to Liam on the phone I told him my plan and asked him about his three children from the previous relationship coming. It was decided he’d speak to their mother, who is a very difficult character, to ask her permission. I booked the flight deal for 5, resigned to the fact that the flight cost would increase for the remaining 4 flights.The flights are over the Easter holiday, and Liams Ex has said the children cannot come. She wants to do an egg hunt with them. Liam wants to move the holiday to suit his ex. The dates suit my daughter whose 21st Birthday we are celebrating, and of course the cheap flight deal is a factor also.This has all backfired onto me because Liam is disappointed they can’t go, he says the other two shouldn’t go. He claims I am not treating the family the same, and has completely overlooked the conversation I had with him before booking, and the subsequent messages I have sent regarding an update on the booking.What should have been a lovely surprise for everyone has been ruined by Liams fury at his ex partner.So am I the asshole for booking the deal flights for my children and grandchildren and not waiting for response from his ex about their three children?",

He asked me to tell them to either keep their original plans of staying with the other friend or get a hotel.I told him it was unreasonable to tell them to pay $500 for a hotel when they had a free place to stay. I said that while I was sorry it made him uncomfortable I wasn’t going to tell them they couldn’t stay at my place. I also told him that if it made him that uncomfortable he should come down and meet everyone and have a fun weekend.

On the other hand, my daughter has not made peace with everything as she found out about the reasons behind the divorce later on and still has a hard time accepting what happened.At some point two years ago, my daughter reached out to me privately via email to unload everything she’s felt for over a decade and I had no clue what to say to it other than I couldn’t believe I caused this much pain. It was a novel of her feelings related to the divorce and how I went about everything related to being supportive of her hobbies, to how she felt staying at my house on the weekends, and even how I skipped her university graduation years ago, which I thought we moved past. My wife somehow saw the email and immediately texted my daughter telling her how horrible she is and how bad the email made her look because she hates being called a mistress.

I remember her saying something like \"Why ruin a good thing just to be a moral person, especially when he's never going to cheat again\" and \"Some things are better left unknown\".I told her then that if she ever knew that my partner had cheated, I'd definitely want to know and would probably be pissed at her if I had found out and she hadn't said anything.  She seemed shocked that I would be mad at her too, so I took that to mean that she didn't agree.Anyway, current day, Liz has been dating Ben (31M) for the last 4 years (5 years if you include the initial year of fwb/situationship).  Liz, in her own words, is a little paranoid and possessive of her partners.  In the first year after they became serious/official, Liz was always a little jealous of Ben's ex (Marie 31F) because they dated for a long time and Ben was still hung up on her when Ben and Liz began sleeping together.Last week, I went to a bar with a couple of my friends and saw Ben sitting alone in a booth.  I was a little surprised because Ben and Liz live in a different city about 1.5 hours away.  I went to say hi, and asked why he was here since I hadn't heard anything from Liz.  He looked really uncomfortable and asked me to not say anything to Liz, that he was here for a friend's mom's funeral.  That immediately made me suspicious because why would he not tell Liz about something like that?Turns out that the 'friend' he's talking about is Marie.  She came back from the washroom during our conversation, and introduced herself.  He took me aside when he realized I knew who she was (Liz had talked to me a lot that first year about Marie), and begged me to not say anything.  He claimed that he hadn't done anything wrong, that he really had just come back to be supportive since he still cared about Marie as a friend and didn't want her to be alone at the funeral.  He said that Liz wouldn't understand and it would just hurt her for no good reason.I know if I told her, she would assume that Ben was cheating, but because of that previous conversation, maybe she would rather not know either way? Just because this would be something I would want to know, it doesn't mean she would. WIBTA for not saying anything to her?",

	"title" : "AITA for not allowing my sister to babysit my daughter?",
	"body" : "AITA because I don't want to allow my 4-year-old daughter to spend time alone with my sister for a weekend because 1) my sister hasn't demonstrated a respect for my authority as a parent, and 2) she's never watched my daughter before and has no childcare experience?My sister is 3 years younger than I am and she doesn't have children of her own. She has never watched my daughter for even a few hours on her own. She has always been flaky and will make big promises and not follow through, or cancel last minute. She loves her carefree life without kids, she doesn't pay for her house or her car, doesn't have medical aid, she spends most of her income on personal care, grooming, shopping, etc. She gets really angry when I cancel plans with her, and I have had to cancel plans in the past, but only because my daughter got sick which often happens because she's in school.Last weekend, we spent the day with family and my daughter played with her cousins. My sister spent most of the day smoking and drinking with the adults, and never looked after the children. When it came time to go home, my daughter didn't want the party to end and my sister made all sorts of promises to her, saying that she could go home with her and stay with her for the night, etc. She didn't talk to me about this before, so I originally took it as empty promises to keep a preschooler from crying.But when I confronted my sister and told her that she can't just promise my daughter things and make arrangements for her without checking with me first, she became very angry, disrespectful and belligerent with me. I had to tell her that she has no right to make decisions for my daughter without checking with me first, and she didn't agree with me, until I said that they could of course do a sleepover, we just had to make the proper arrangements. You can't just change the plans willy nilly, or make promises to a child that you don't intend on keeping.I feel deeply disrespected by my sister and feel like she is undermining my authority with my daughter. My husband and I are going through a divorce, and my sister is really judgmental and not supportive at all. Her response to my initial announcement was to change the subject to her relationship status with her on-off long-term boyfriend. I am afraid that if she spends time with my daughter, she will talk badly behind my back or do things that I wouldn't be okay with. She also smokes and I don't want my daughter around that.My sister just texted me to ask if my daughter, who has never spent a night away from me, can spend the weekend with her. So AITA for not wanting that to happen right now? And should I explain myself or just make an excuse and say why now isn't a good time? My sister can be very combative and I don't feel up to fighting her as well, I'm already dealing with a lot and trying to hold my head above water.",

She was abandoned as a baby and nearly died in an orphanage before being adopted and raised by an American family. Aya considers herself American and is firm that due to her traumatic experience with China, she has no desire to “be Chinese” or explore the language and culture.Zach is also Chinese and the son of wealthy business owners. He is very proud of his culture.Background: A few years ago at dinner, Zach took Aya’s fork and knife and told her she needed to eat with chopsticks. I immediately stopped him and made him give her silverware back, wondering wtf that was about.Later, Aya told me Zach had decided she needed to be “more Chinese” and was pressuring her to engage with Chinese language/culture. Zach apologized, Aya let it go.Current situation: Aya asked me and Zach to help plan her wedding. Zach suggested Aya wear a qipao, have red as a wedding color, no white dress, serve Chinese food, etc.I pulled Zach aside and told him Aya has been very clear she does not want a Chinese wedding, stop forcing it. Please just follow what Aya wants. Chinese culture is lovely, but this is not the time or place.Aya was grateful and thanked me for reining Zach in, because she was having a hard time confronting him. Bridal party and most friends agreed.However, Zach and some others are upset, saying Zach has the right to express his culture and make suggestions, Zach feels lonely and there are not a lot of other Chinese people around, Aya IS Chinese so not a big deal.Now, I’m not anti-Chinese. Zach and I actually met in Chinese class and enjoy doing Chinese cultural things together. I am from a different culture myself. I know it’s hard. When Zach marries, I will support him having a Chinese wedding.But Aya has trauma around her Chinese roots and considers herself American. She DOES NOT WANT Chinese traditions. I support Aya in having an American wedding.I refused to apologize, and Zach is more upset. I understand Zach loves his culture but I don’t think he has the right to push it at Aya’s wedding. AITA?EDIT: Sorry folks, I think I was unclear about it. Aya and Zach are not getting married to each other. Aya is marrying an American and Zach and I are just helping to plan the wedding.",

	"body" : "So i've been dating this girl for 11 months today and let me tell you, she's the love of my life. I met her through a mutual friend from collage and started dating shortly after. I wont bore you with details but just know she's the nicest and prettiest girl I know, im so lucky to have her.A couple months into the relationship I told her that I was going to take a trip to Spain with my family. It was pretty close to her birthday so she got a little sad, but I told her I'd be back a day or so before.When I was in Barcelona I realized there was a Harry Styles concert going on, which is her favorite artist BY FAR. I thought it'd be nice if I got her a Tour Shirt for her birthday since she likes so much but since I didn't have a ticket I had to bribe the security guard to let me in to where the store was, fortunately it worked and bought her the shirt and a Special Edition Vinyl.When I came back home I gave her the present for her birthday and she seemed to love it. Nothing came from that as it was a couples months back. The problem comes when today that one mutual friend called me and said he wanted to talk.He told me she came by his house today for a get together their friend group had. Someone brought up the topic of \"Gifts\" to which my girlfriend told everyone that she hated the gift I gave her fir her birthday. She stated that she thought that since it was her birthday I'd get her a much more nicer and expensive gift. She cares a lot about her birthday and she thought that a shirt and a Vinyl was really lame.So im here wondering, what the hell? I was really hurt by this because I thought it was a nice and caring gift, if you wanna talk money the shirt was 150 EUROS and the vinyl was 40 ( about $230 USD). We live in a Third World Country so that money is some people's monthly salary...Did I mess up by not getting her a more expensive gift? Should I tell her how I feel?",

I always liked her but knew that she had boundary problems as she would often come to my sister's house unannounced. She is disabled and cannot work. so I have always had sympathy for her.When I started dating her son she wanted to spend a lot of time with me which I didn't see issue with as I already knew her. This was a mistake.No amount of time spent with her was enough. She felt entitled to every ounce of free time I had. She needed me to do everything with her and would guilt trip me even if I had work or plans with friends. She would manipulate me by planning a dinner without me knowing or set up the patio with drinks and snacks so if I dropped by, I would feel bad if I couldn't stay long.  Anytime I was over there with my bf she would try to be apart of all our time together and would linger where we were and stare at us until we invited her into the convo.Boundaries needed to be set with her. She did not take it well. My bf let her know that she was asking for way too much.She started acting out in some dramatic ways. She would stomp around the house when I was over, started saying I couldn't spend the night because me and my bf aren't married, told us she felt excluded, like we were avoiding her by spending time in his room. We tried facilitating this by watching movies in the living room, that of which she interrupted constantly by talking or making as much noise in the kitchen as possible- slamming cupboards, turning on the garbage disposal for minutes at a time, rustling through plastic bags, and other attention seeking behaviors. What made me lose all respect was when she started protesting against my boyfriend taking me on dates by telling him not to spend his money or waste gas.Her behavior after having simple boundaries set made me really dislike her and see how manipulative she is. I've been told to attribute this selfish mindset to her disease so it makes me feel ableist to dislike her for that reason. She suffocated all chances of me wanting to have any kind of relationship with her which she protested by saying that it would be very hard on her son, which might be true considering the living situation. My boyfriend is protective of me and advocates for me, and just ignores her deterrents.She's made it clear that If I don't want to be her best friend, that she'll make the environment hostile.AITAH for not wanting to have a close relationship with her? I am cordial, I do avoid her, but I never disrespect her when I see her by straight up ignoring her.Any advice is welcome.My bf and I are saving up for own place but she has now started asking my boyfriend to give her money because they are struggling financially and he barely makes any as is at his part time job,",

I needed someone to watch Goose.My sister May (32F) offered to watch him and I told her I would send her emergency money for Goose. For food, toys and whatever needs he need. She agreed and my niece (7F) loves Goose. So I though everything was great. I went on my travel with my girlfriends and it was lovely and great but on the last day May called to say that Goose ran off and she can’t find him. I was very devastated when I heard that.

I noticed they all had a tight tubular \"mask\" on over their nose and mouth, like a thick sock. It looked pretty uncomfortable for them.My uncle explained that the owners had put \"spit masks\" / \"spit socks\" on all the alpacas before our arrival and it was a common thing, and something he requested all clients to do before an alpaca shearing.The goal is to deter them from spitting (since the spit will backfire) and to make sure you don't get spit on.Well, I didn't think that was a very good justification for something like that. It looked stifling and uncomfortable for them, and the only benefit is avoiding spit?During a break I checked on my phone and it said the only big problem with alpaca spit is that it can stink, it's not like it's harmful or anything. And they seemed well-behaved anyways. I was willing to risk a bit of spit to make the alpacas more comfortable.So while my uncle was shearing, I removed the spit-mask from a couple of alpacas without him noticing. When he noticed, he got really angry and said \"put those back on, what are you doing, do you want to be spit on?\"I said I wasn't too worried about it and I wanted what was best for the alpacas. He said \"you have no clue what you're talking about, put them back on now.\"I didn't see what the big deal was and said if anything it'd be me that got spat on from it, not him. He said \"I'm the one who has to drive you home, do you have any idea what that will be like if it spits on you?\"I didn't do it again but I feel like he was overreacting and it was sort of contentious the rest of the time. We didn't talk much on the ride home and I get the feeling he won't be inviting me to further farm days.It feels petty to me for him to be so worked up about me risking getting spit on (probably not even him) as if I couldn't clean up before driving home, I don't see what the big deal is.

Pretty early on in our relationship, he told me that he had 2 daughters with his ex-wife who are now 15 and 22, and were 11 and 18 when I met them. While he was telling me about them he mentioned that after he and his ex-wife split up, his older daughter Chelsea (Not her real name) blamed him and still does. I didn’t think much of it at the time and didn’t end up meeting either of them until a year later.The first time I met Chelsea was during a 4th of July party with my husband, both his daughters, his ex-wife and her husband and various friends. By that point I had already met my younger step daughter a few times and she and I actually hit it off pretty well. However Chelsea seemed upset and kept her distance from me the whole party, and when I tried to introduce myself or even talk to her she gave me very short answers, before going into the house (it was at her mother’s house) for the rest of the night.That is essentially how our entire relationship has been. I’ve known her for 4 years and in that time I don’t think I’ve had one friendly conversation with her, nor have I seen her have a nice conversation with my husband. Every time that my husband or I try to reach out to her to try to spend time or even talk to her, she’ll blow us off or directly tell us she doesn’t want to see us, and she has never spent any individual time with us. By which I mean she’s only around in group settings like parties and family events, etc and even then she’s very cold and distant towards both of us.When my husband and I got engaged, I called both Chelsea and her sister to tell them, and all Chelsea said was congratulations and then not to expect to see her at the wedding before hanging up. She ended up not attending the wedding at all.The straw that broke the camel’s back, however, was a few days ago when she walked by while I was on facetime with my husband’s younger daughter. I called her over and asked her about her graduation (she’s graduating from college this May). She once again blew me off and told me not to worry about it, and when I told her that my husband and I would be there she said she already knew who she was giving tickets to and that it wasn’t either of us.I snapped and told her she was being ridiculous and acting like a child and that her parents’ divorce was 14 years ago and she needs to get over it. She told me that she was over the divorce but that she’ll never get over her “father being a piece of shit” (her exact words). I was honestly speechless and she hung up the facetime before I could respond.My husband got a text from his ex-wife that night, telling him that if he wants to have a relationship with his younger daughter he needs to leave Chelsea alone and tell me to as well. My husband told me Chelsea has been this way towards him since she was 9, and we're not sure what to do and it would be helpful to get some outside perspective. AITA?",

She immediately responded, “that’s great!” Followed with “don’t expect your father and I to pay for anything for the wedding!” Bc she said “we’re too old.” (This will be important later). This was completely unprompted as I had never asked. To this I responded that he and I don’t really want a wedding and we’re not sure what we’ll do after engagement and when it comes time to plan. Her response was that “I better not elope again” and “she expects” “a nice wedding of some kind regardless of the size.” For context: I eloped with my first husband and she was embarrassed and devastated (her words). We ended the phone call by me saying she can’t have expectations if she’s not willing to contribute and that I wasn’t even engaged yet and we’ll talk about it later. My boyfriend and I don’t make a ton of money and probably cannot afford even a small ceremony and wedding dinner for even ten people if we’re being honest. We’re fine.

Am I the asshole for being upset?For clarity: my issue is that she’s (my mother) is insisting on a nice wedding of some kind. Insisting with no financial backing. The salt in the wound was to find out she’s paying for half my brothers and won’t admit this is not about “age” as she’d previously said with no explanation just further demands that if I do get married there will be a wedding paid out of my pocket",

	"body" : "Okay, my boyfriend insists that I'm the AH in this situation so I'm posting this here in the hopes that Reddit will see things my way.My boss Mr B. (M60s) owns several shoe stores so he only comes around once a week or so and I don't know him super well. The store I work at has three employees and by random coincidence we're all in our late 20s-early 30s so we get along pretty well. I assume that's why our boss's wife, Mrs B. (F, I wanna say late30s-early40s?), likes to hang around at this store more. She usually comes here a few days a week without her husband and I wouldn't say we're friends with her but we're friendly. She's kind of a character - almost a caricature of a rich person that's completely disconnected from reality but she's nice enough. Here's where it gets tricky: Mrs B. loves to flirt. She didn't exactly marry for love if you get my drift and while Mr B. knows that she comes to the store he definitely doesn't know that she meets guys there and sometimes even leaves with them and only comes back a few hours later. None of us have told her husband, we just mind our own business.The issue is that me and my boyfriend ran into one of my co-workers (I guess I'll call her Gayle) while grocery shopping the other day and Gayle ended up jokingly mentioning Mrs B. and her 'guys.' I don't even remember what she said exactly but once Gayle and her husband left my boyfriend asked me what she meant by that so I told him about the secret rendezvous and he said I needed to tell Mr B. because he deserves to know. I thought he was joking at first but he was dead serious.I told him there's no way I'm gonna get involved in my boss's marriage, but my bf thinks I'm already involved since me and my colleagues 'cover for her' (we don't, we just keep our traps shut). He's decided that it speaks badly to my character or that it means I think cheating is okay or something. Idk, he won't drop this and I just think he's failing to understand that this is my place of work and I'm just trying to get through the work day, not create unnecessary drama for myself. So AITA?",

We were so excited to have a home that was officially ours, even if it was just a small 2 bedroom apartment. One thing we both agreed on was any visitors giving us a visit would also need to give us a heads up. We're not big on people showing up unexpectedly,  this is our home & we would like our privacy, which I think is understandable. Everyone has been respectful of this boundary...minus my boyfriends grandmother. She knows of our request about calling before showing up. But she acts like that boundary does not apply to her. She shows up unannounced, even as late as midnight with no warning. This has happened MULTIPLE times, no matter how many times we ask her not to. Fast forward a few weeks after she's done this numerous times, and I finally had enough. I told my boyfriend that any time she now shows up with no heads up, I will not be answering the door. (This applies to anyone showing up unannounced. She's just the only person who actually does.) She will just have to stand out there until she gets tired of knocking & leaves. He agreed this was the only way we could get it through her head. Side note, I don't mind her coming over. She's allowed to visit, as long as we have that heads up. But this has been going on for almost a year. Even after we told her we won't let her in if she shows up unannounced, that doesn't stop her from continuing to do it. I'm sure she thinks we'll cave, but so far we have not. I won't give in & reward her for disrespecting boundaries. We've been called rude & assholes for doing this, but I don't think I'm wrong for asking for a notice before someone shows up to our home, our safe space. All I asked was for my boundaries to be respected, and she can't do that, so now she has to suffer the consequences.So reddit, AITA?*ETA: I see a lot of comments asking if she has dementia or has been evaluated, so I'd just like to post here: her 2 sons have had her evaluated. Dr's believe nothing is wrong, there's no signs of dementia and claim there is nothing to be worried about. She is a very intrusive human being. Bf's family claims that's \"just how she is\" & I \"signed up for it when I joined the family.\" Thats how the always excuse her behavior...I wish I could say this is the worst of it",

	"title" : "AITA for Getting My College Roommate Kicked Out",
	"body" : "I (18F) am currently a freshman in college. I moved into my dorm in August of last semester, and I got along quite well with my roommate (18F). However, upon leaving for winter break, she told me she would be transferring to a new school the following semester (this semester). I was saddened to hear this, as the last thing I wanted to do was start over with a brand new roommate. Two weeks ago, I arrived back on campus and went to my dorm to unpack.My new roommate (19F) had already arrived, and she was lying on my bed. Our dorm is about the size of a standard bedroom, with two beds side by side and two small desks at the foot of each bed. It's a pretty small space for two people. Anyway, I was confused as to why she was lying on my bed, as the other bed was completely empty and my bed still had my comforter and pillows on it. I informed her that this bed was mine, and asked if she wanted any help moving her things to the other side of the room. She then informed me that she wanted my bed because it was closer to the only window in the room. The reason being, she was from a rural area and wanted to feel more connected to nature. I told her that would be difficult, as all my belongings were already on my side of the room. She begrudgingly went to the other bed, so already not off to a great start. After a couple days of living with her, she would basically ignore me 24/7. My attempts to get to know her were fruitless. All of this culminated into a big fight around three days ago. I came back from class, ready to finish my homework and take a nap. To my horror, she had switched our beds. All of my belongings were strewn to the other side of the room. I was livid. I asked her why she would do such a thing without even talking to me first. She simply pretended she couldn't hear me. I went over to check on my stuff, and my framed picture of my deceased grandmother and I was SHATTERED. So, I started yelling at her.Finally, she gave in and yelled back at me, saying that I didn't understand how hard college was for her, since this was her first semester. She detailed that the window reminded her of her home in that she used to sit by her window at night to listen to the sounds of nature. I said I didn't care, that she couldn't mess with my stuff, and that I was going to go the RA about it. That thought seemed to scare her, because she begged me not to bring it up to anyone else. She explained how had she had very strict parents and therefore couldn't risk getting into trouble. I went to the RA anyway, and the matter was taken very seriously. This resulted in the two of us going to a meeting with the housing department. I explained to them my side of the story and showed them photographs of my damaged belongings. She basically had no defense, so they charged her for my damaged belongings and forced her to move to a different dorm. She cried. I have since heard from our RA that she has withdrawn from the university. So, AITA for bringing it to the RA?",

We all used to live in the same vicinity but only started getting close post-covid and after everyone had to move out for pandemic safety due to us being located in a city. Bee and I have gotten pretty close since then, traveling together once a year. This included Elle up until two years ago.In 2022, Bee and I flew over to visit Elle (and her younger sister Mimi 28f + other friends in the area), who we were staying with. I'm also pretty close to Mimi but she isn't close to Bee. One night, we were all at Mimi and her girlfriend's place and decided to play pictionary while high. However, Elle was really tired and decided to dip out early. I thought Bee would be going back with her but she stayed despite not knowing Mimi and the gf long. This made me and our hosts pretty uncomfortable because she stuck to me all night and cracked jokes about how ugly our drawings were turning out. I don't think they were meant to be malicious but Mimi mentioned afterwards she definitely felt like Bee overstepped her boundaries bc they barely know each other. Before I go further let me say that Bee is a good person - like a REALLY good person. She's very empathetic, morally upstanding and always available to help when someone is in need.I usually love sarcastic shit eating humor but Bee started jokingly to give Elle's now husband crap for not knowing facts about his favorite movie right and also (jokingly) judged him for his taste in rock music bc she loves Kiss and he didn't. That was her brand of humor the entire trip. This can get a bit irritating at times even for me as she's critiqued me for my sleep schedule (I'm a freelancer) or my dedication if I don't want to catch up to a book/manga as fast as her.The next day we all went for dinner with Mimi and her gf, where Bee once again openly criticized the food for not being as good as where she's from. She said several times she was joking but Mimi ended up faking sick and leaving the restaurant because she was done. Since then, Elle has been speaking less to Bee, to which she has expressed her frustration to me. But Elle specifically asked me to keep quiet as she told me she wanted to have a heart to heart with Bee herself. Well...she got married and it hasn't happened yet.They're both adults so I figured I was a third party and I'd let them figure it out amongst themselves but after coming back from the wedding I feel complicit in some mean girls-esque you can't sit with us shit. Apparently, other friends have slowly disappeared like this from Bee's in the past so she has a huge affliction to it and gets completely defensive even when a friend wants to disconnect for themselves for a bit. At this point, I don't know if Elle will ever actually speak to Bee again. NGL I'm feeling pretty damn stupid for going to that wedding now.AITA?",

I've never dyed my hair and I rarely style or blow-dry it so it's very healthy. My natural color is a very uncommon red, I've been told my whole life that it's almost impossible to recreate. It's not an uncommon thing for people to tell me they want my hair.2 weeks ago I finally decided I wanted to cut it short and donate it to Angel Hair For Kids, a company that makes wigs for children fighting cancer and other illnesses. I told my dad I was doing this and when I was doing it and he thought it was a great idea. I ended up cutting off 16 inches and have honestly never felt more like myself with my new haircut. I feel like I finally recognize myself again and for the first time in years feel good about myself.Cut to that same night. I had sent my dad a picture of my chopped off hair at the salon followed by the haircut pics. About an hour later I received a text from my stepmother (71f) who we'll call Jane. She asked if I would consider giving her the hair so she could have it sent out to make a wig for herself.Jane and I have had a very rocky relationship in the past. For 2 years in high school I didn't speak to her or my dad because of an issue that she had caused and never apologized for. We've since moved on and have a better relationship now. She has dealt with major health issues as long as I've known her and within the past 2 years has lost nearly all of her hair. She recently bought 2-3 wigs that look amazing on her. Every time we discussed the wigs she would joke that I should give her my hair since I had so much of it. Well it turns out that I misunderstood and she wasn't actually joking.When Jane asked me for my hair I had already sent it away for donation, which I told her. She didn't say anything about it after that, just asked me for more picture of my haircut which I sent. In all honesty the idea of giving her my hair feels quite weird to me. I imagine showing up to Christmas to see her wearing my hair and it brings up weird emotions about my previous relationship with her when I was younger and she was more controlling.When I saw my dad the following Monday he almost immediately brought up the fact that I had \"donated it elsewhere\" instead of giving it to Jane. I asked if she was upset about it and my dad told me that she was, and that he was also disappointed that I didn't think of her first. It's caused some tension between us and has made me uncomfortable, but it's also really put a damper on the whole experience of doing something good and finally feeling good about myself. I feel like I've done something wrong and selfish now.TLDR; I donated my hair to a children's cancer foundation instead of giving it to my stepmother who is dealing with hair loss and now she and my dad are disappointed in me.AITA here?",

She was an accident and it was very hard at first, but we managed to raise a wonderful young lady.In middle school, Mary had a best friend Dan (16M). They were really close and since we’re neighbors, we encouraged them to hang out together.However as they started high school, Dan started running with the wrong crowd. He befriended a kid who would sneak out, drink, engage in destructive activities. Together they started bullying Mary. Since then I have some sort of a slow beef with Dan’s mom (44F). We are on speaking terms, but things are somewhat rough between us. I personally consider her parenting style a little too lax, she thinks I'm being too strict.It escalated when this kid pissed in Mary’s car’s gas tank. To say I was fuming was an understatement. I turned into a full-blown momzilla. I was ready to sue his whole family, luckily it didn’t happen since his mom was cooperative and compensated for the damage. I also told Dan’s mom that her kid’s friend destroyed my daughter’s property. No reaction.Obviously, things escalated further. Dan and his friend committed a felony. To be honest, it was expected of his friend, but the fact that Dan was an accomplice shocked me deeply. He’s a gentle and kind guy and it was horrible that he fell under bad influence. Dan’s mom was shocked as well, but to be honest it was something that she could expect after finding out that her kid got under bad influence, doing nothing about it, buying him substances so he could share with his friends. We live in CO btw, but still weed isn't something I'd introduce my child to.That was what I openly told her after she complained about “how come my precious baby commit a felony” and “how did you manage to make Mary avoid the sketchy stuff”. I told her that if she was slightly stricter with her parenting, she’d avoid Dan having legal troubles now. She told me that I’m being hypocritical since I did quite an amount of stupid stuff in my youth too. I did, and I’m not proud of it. But I’ve never touched substances and I’ve never committed a felony. I took the responsibility and accepted the consequences and managed to raise a decent human being who won’t repeat my mistakes.I’m an insightful person and I’ve been thinking now whether it was worth it to drag the conflict for all this time and escalating it into an open confrontation.",

These all started after he made friends with some bad crowds, a group of pre-teens, and teenagers who calls themselves drumstick something-something gang and claims the neighborhood as their turf.

So me and my mom and sis lived with him. My sis moved out at 20 me and my mom are still living with my dad. Me and my sis have a good relationship though.I am currently getting my masters degree and working part time. I’ve been saving money to move away. Idk what to do with my mother.My mother has refused to work for 20+ yrs because god told her not to. Basically I give her money everytime I get paid so she can buy herself stuff. IF it wasn’t for me she would have no clothes, shoes, food. My dad allows her to stay in the house and if it wasn’t for him we would be homeless. I help out with bills, I buy all groceries and toiletries and give my dad money when he needs some help.Her working would help us tremendously. She contributes nothing. We have been here for 13 yrs and she has done nothing. She told me god said he would get her out of this house ( idk how?). She also told me that before I was born god told her that she would be a millionaire ( again idk how)She has no friends. She sits in the house all day everyday watching videos on YouTube and tv. She does arts and crafts sometimes. She can and feed herself do the  normal ADLs. She says she don’t trust people she has no family on her side (cut off from them for good reasons mother mentally abusive and father sexually abusive). She told me she used to hear god talk to her when she was a child. As I’ve gotten older I realize this may have been from abusive she endured and this voice is probably a coping mechanism.I think my depression and anxiety came from being a trauma dump for my mom as a child and even now . She would tell me about how her parents abused her she complains to me everyday. Everything that comes out of her mouth is negative and is from stuff that happens to her 10+ yrs ago. It’s hard to  listen to constantly when I’m dealing with my own shit and being told it’s demons.Anyways, my bf lives in Chicago. We met at college and he got a job there he told me I could live with him when I’m done with school. I have come to the realization is that I’m not going to have a life of my own.My sister told me that if I cut her off she might get help. Idk if I can…I don’t  want to do that though. I lost out on my teenage years  being stuck in the house and not having fun and experiences because of her coddling. Know I feel like I’m going to miss out on my 20s because I have to care for her. I know I sound like an asshole but what else am I supposed to do? I can’t let her be homeless.",

	"title" : "AITA for replacing my model for gaining weight?",
	"body" : "I (16F) am a college student taking textiles as one of my subjects. For a project, we had to create a collection of designs that would be showcased in a school fashion show. Most of the other girls chose to model their own designs, but I initially felt too shy to do so. I chose four of my friends to model for my outfits, who were from UK sizes 6-10, and made my dresses to fit their measurements.One of my friends (17F) was a size 8 (which is a size 4 in the US btw), and her dress was meant to be the centrepiece of my project. In the four months since I first started working on the dress, my friend has managed to gain a lot of weight. She was taking medication for her bipolar disorder, and one of the side effects was weight gain, going up 8 dress sizes. The material I used for my dress was quite stretchy so I thought her size wouldn’t matter that much. However, we were doing a rehearsal of the fashion show a few weeks ago when her dress suddenly split down one of the seams. We were three weeks away from the showcase, so there was still enough time to fix it. That said, I was worried that the dress might break again and there wouldn’t be enough time to mend it, or even worse, it might break during the actual catwalk. I decided that I should wear the dress instead since I knew the choreography of the catwalk, so we wouldn’t have to waste time teaching anyone else. Plus, all the other designers were wearing their own dresses, and I was started to regret my decision to stay behind the scenes.I broke the news to my friend and she was extremely upset over my decision. She had been looking forward to this for months, and she had been feeling depressed over her weight gain and thought that modelling make her confident again. I told her that it wasn’t her fault she gained weight due to her meds but I just needed a good grade and it wasn’t anything personal. She pointed out that we had three weeks until the show, so I had plenty of time to adjust the dress to make it bigger. In order to tailor the dress I would have to remove most of the embellishments and reapply them again after adding a large panel to the bodice. I still had to study for exams in two other subjects, and I didn’t want to risk over stressing and having an incomplete dress by the deadline, so I refused to alter the dress. Ever since then she’s been acting passive aggressive towards me, always bringing up her mental health and body image issues around me, as if she’s trying to make me feel guilty for my decision.

	"body" : "Me (19f) and my friend, Penny (19f + fake name) have been friends for over a decade. After finishing school, we didn't see each other as much so she started coming to my house every couple weeks since my family would be out. I went to hers recently, which was nice but brings me to the main story.So two weeks ago on Saturday, I went to Penny's house. It was about 4pm when I left which meant it was dark but not pitch black. I usually have no problem with walking home when it's like that since it's a 10 min walk and all on a main road. However, whenever Penny has walked home from my house, she has always asked me to walk with her because she didn't like walking home on her own. It really rubs me the wrong way that she doesn't feel comfortable doing it, but she's comfortable with me doing it. The part that annoys me the most is that she has just bought her car a few days prior to this happening and while I get her not feeling comfortable driving it without another driver yet, her dad was home and I don't think he was busy enough to not drive me home/sit in the car with Penny while she drove.The following Tuesday, I had to go to an ENT appointment at the hospital. Penny and I have both been to countless ENT appointments so we both get it. We both stopped going to our appointments when we got older because we didn't want the fuss anymore. I also have a big fear of needles and operations and just overall hated the anxiety. Penny knows about all of this. I told Penny about my appointment when I first got the call and then on Saturday. Fast forward to Tuesday and no message about it. I didn't want to confront her straight away in case she remembered it later but nope, it's been a week now and no message about how it went or anything.Then on the following Friday, I had my first ever paid photography gig. I told her about it when I got asked to do the photos and talked about how nervous I was on the saturday. But I got no message about that either.Yesterday I finally got a message from her asking me if I wanted to go to hers this Saturday, specifying that she would be able to drive me home this time. I haven't replied to her message and today she followed it up by just sending a \"?\". I feel like she knows I am pissed at her because we never go this long without messaging each other, but I don't think she knows the truth of why I am pissed at her. Thing is I still want to be friends with her because of all the good times we've had, even at hers on Saturday was great until I had to walk home alone. Now I'm starting to feel like I'm overreacting and it's not really that big of a deal so I should just reply and go on as normal. But I also feel like friends should try to keep each other safe and remember important things in their lives. My family are backing me up, but because of previous issues me and Penny have had, I feel like they might be biased. So AITA?",

Followed by how it is her choice and I did not have a say in this and apologized again if I pressured her into giving up on the procedure with silent treatment. Then I listed a long paragraph about how much I love the things she wanted to change and I am there for her to talk about with her insecurities if she wanted to etc.She almost immediatly apologized as well and said how she emphasized with me and how she would feel terrible if I tried to change my appearence and said all these time we spent distant(3 hours) made her realize she didn’t even want it in the beginning and would try to love herself as she is.

We have helped each other through some difficult times. Ex: when she got pregnant by multiple semi pro baseball players. I would always be the first one she would call. Vise Versa. She would always ask me for rides to places, for me to pick her up, just to hangout with our kids. There were and are times in our now friendship that we go months often years without talking.

He insisted on staying.Over the next few days he was really great, visited daily, brought me a blanket, flowers, clothes, food, checked on my cat a couple times (at my request). I thanked him every time, told him the blanket made my visit better, that I loved the flowers and every nurse was commenting on them, etc. When he visited he’d stay about 30 mins before I told him to go home to do his work.I finally got out and called him to pick me up. I asked to stay at his place for a bit since Im not supposed to be driving and wanted observation. He was ok with it. We had a tiff that evening when I said I had a headache & he told me that’s not possible since I don’t have nerves in my brain & that my stroke was so small I’m probably imagining it. I explained it is possible and very common, and asked him to not minimize my experience. He started to raise his voice in defense and I calmly said that I will not deal with being yelled at right after a stroke. He apologized & said he was trying to make me feel better & then left.When he got home he was visibly annoyed. I told him I wasn’t mad and asked what’s wrong, he broke down and said he was stressed about his work. I told him it was ok to take a break to eat and take a nap, to tell his work that I had a stroke & it would be ok, that there was no need to stress so badly. I said I’d have my mom fly out and stay with me to give him space so he can work.He woke me up in the morning with all kinds of food (not sure if I thanked him since I was so out of it but I was clearly happy and praised his choices) then tried to stay out of his way and do some puzzles (to help my brain) while he worked. Later, I asked him to take me to pick up my meds. Again, he was annoyed and asked why I picked a CVS that was 6 mins away instead of a closer one, and if it would be a regular thing. I assured him it was a one time pickup and thanked him for taking me. Once home he was still visibly annoyed so again, I asked what’s wrong. To which he said that he feels like I’ve been unappreciative towards him, that he’s gone out of his way a lot, and that I didn’t comfort him appropriately last night.I told him I do appreciate him but also I just had a stroke & I don’t have the mental capacity to deal with him sulking around & having to manage his emotions. I need to be focused on my cognitive therapy to make sure I have the best recovery possible. I told him I’d be getting an Uber home and I hope he got his work done. He said he didn’t want me to be alone & I said I’d rather be alone than deal with drama.So now I’m home alone, & my mom is buying a last minute ticket to come stay with me.

I talk to him a lot, but it looks like he has some limits because he listens to me and then his patience is over and he starts screaming at me.

Friend is a very loose term-they live out of state and I rarely see/speak to them anymore, literally haven’t spoken to them in about a year recently. I got married 2 years ago and decided to have her in my wedding solely because she asked me to be in theirs about 4 years ago (their wedding has been pushed off due to covid). I have never liked her fiancé and the majority of all our mutual friends dislike him as well. He’s a cheater, liar, and I recently found out, abusive. I confronted my friend about this a few years ago and she broke down and told me it was true. I tried to get her out of the relationship by offering her to stay at my place for free for as long as she needed. She told me he was aware of his bad behavior and that he promised her he was going to change, stop drinking so much, etc. My heart broke for her. But I realized I was helpless in the situation and she was going to do what she wanted regardless.Fast forward to a few months ago, she texts me saying that they have set a date for their wedding. She knows things aren’t well between me and her fiancé (he knows I know and I refuse to be around him-he was not allowed at my wedding) so she expressed how she would still like me there regardless of the situation. Initially I was going to say yes of course I can put a smile on my face and pretend I approve of the wedding. But the more I thought about it: I realized I would be highly uncomfortable there, I didn’t want her to worry about my presence causing any issues on the happiest day of her life, and honestly I didn’t trust her fiancé not to cause a scene with me once he had a few drinks. So after much thought, I politely declined saying I didn’t think it was a good idea for me to be there and I wished her the best of luck and I hoped her day was perfect. She responded saying that it was probably for the best that I hung back and she completely understood. Also, I should mention I obviously was demoted from bridesmaid to wedding guest-which she never outright said but I figured out myself.AITA?

I told his mum my idea on the name prior to them even being pregnant, I’m assuming she told them and they loved it, which is fine.Problem is, I’m pregnant, still in early stages so I don’t know the gender. This is my last child and i decided prior to getting pregnant that my last child, whether female or male, would be getting this name (I have a feeling it’s a boy as we’ve got two boys so far).Now WIBTA if I used this name for my child? I know baby names are very controversial for some families. I thought of maybe letting the partner know that I will be using this name and that I’ve loved it for years. But just to kinda let her know prior to the announcement later down the track, so she doesn’t feel a certain way? (If she does at all of course)~ They also live in a different state so I don’t see them often. ~",

She asked me how long he’d been doing it for. At this point, I was feeling really uncomfortable. I wanted to say “you should ask him this”. The truth? He’d been doing it for a year and a half. But, I ended up telling her it was for “several months”, or “a couple months” (one of those, I don’t quite remember which). To this day, she thinks I’m a complete liar, and doesn’t trust me. I don’t know if she knows that I bent the truth about the time frame, but she’s mad I didn’t tell her about her brother’s vaping in the first place. I feel bad about lying about the time frame, but, from my perspective, l shouldn’t be required to report her brother’s business, or every little detail about his life to her. AITA?",

So 6 years of schooling so far.The other day I was back in my home town for New Years and I ran into my old friend, who we'll call Anna 26(F). Anna had a few gap years before starting a Bachelor of Science majoring in Physics. She has just finished her second year.Whilst we were drinking at her boyfriend (Marks) NYE party, she mentioned how lucky I am to be studying a DVM because I get to hang out with kittens and puppies. I told her I'm very grateful to be studying this but it is a lot of work and the academic workload is a lot on top of placement as well.She jokingly said, \"well at least its not quantum physics!\" I laughed and told her I'd like to see her elbow deep in a cow's ass.She almost immediately changed tone and said \"I wish my studies were that easy, I've got books upon books of equations to complete.\" She then went on to say how she'd wanted to be a vet when she was a child and how she should have chosen it since its a lot easier than her current degree. She raved for a bit about how hard she studies and how easy it must be for me to slack off and spend time prancing around on a farm for credits.I told her I was just joking around and that vet school is actually quite intense, in fact its very difficult to get into. I explained its why I completed an undergrad degree first, and that I think a lot of people really underestimate how difficult it is, despite being a medical doctorate.Anna snapped back and said \"well I got into physics school, so it shouldn't be that difficult.\"I told her to get f*cked and got up and left. Spent new years with my family instead. Vet school has been really hard for me and hearing her be so dismissive set me off, especially because I've never heard anyone say \"physics school\" before. She just seemed really intent on saying how much worse she has it. I ended up forgetting about it but 3 or 4 days later, Mark (Anna's bf, party host) sent me a message asking me to apologize to Anna. He said I shouldn't have sworn at her and my behavior was unreasonable.I know I reacted a bit harshly but I'm not going to apologize. AITA if I don't apologize?",

Growing up with her was a struggle and as an adult who no longer lives with my parents I have not maintained any contact with Maci. This is something my parents understood and accepted until they mentioned wanting me home for the graduation and I refused.I will clarify the bad relationship before going more into the issue. I always struggled with school. I had a hard time as a kid and was very late diagnosed with audio processing disorder and dyslexia. My grades were terrible for a long time and Maci was the opposite. She didn't really have to try to get good grades. She's very intelligent and did great in school. She used to make fun of me and would call me dumb. She'd ask why I was so dumb and couldn't even do her homework right. Sometimes she would switch our homework out so I would need to work extra hard and long. I never noticed because of my struggles with reading. It was embarrassing and while she was punished, she never let up on me. It was all a big joke to her and she would tell me it was embarrassing to be my sister. She'd tell me how teachers would compliment her and say they were glad she was a better student than me. She even brought this up around people outside of our home and really went the extra mile.When I did eventually get diagnosed with learning disabilities, she called me the the slur that starts with r and said I should quit school because I would always be dumb. She also started to mock the way I was learning and trying to figure out reading better. My parents eventually just separated us completely during anything school related. They had us both in therapy. They punished her for it. But she would bring back up how embarrassing it was to be my sister.It took a lot for me to graduate and my final grades were nothing special. She made a social media post asking if people should celebrate graduating if they can't even get a C and have no hope for college. My parents were furious with her and they deleted her social media account for the stunt. But it was my breaking point I think.I walked away from the relationship with my sister and once I moved out did not speak to her like I said. My parents still feel like I should attend her graduation at a minimum because as she grows as a person I might regret it and she might feel like I no longer was open to a relationship at all. They told me I could go for the ceremony at least and I asked them why I should leave my life to support someone who finds it so embarrassing to be my sister.My parents argued that I'm older and should know people change a lot from their teens to adults.

We're classmates on that one subject that were grouped together then hit off as becoming besties. The issue is that she's a great friend to hang out with. I just don't like her in anything about academic related.She always asked for my answers on activities, but never helped me when I needed it. I told her that if we both work together to solve then only we can share solutions but it seems she doesn't notice that and continues to bombard me with messages asking for my activities. I know I should have cut her off when I saw signs but she's really a great friend. Like we're comfortable sharing our ups and downs.  I guess we were becoming too comfortable with each other in such a short time. This semester, we had two classes together. One of them required an argumentative essay in a week. Iris got   sick during that week. She didn't say what it was but I never pressed on that matter since it's her health and she may be uncomfortable to share it. So she was given an excuse to pass the assignment at a later date, this is according to our university policy.I didn't expect her to  come up to me to want to read the argumentative essay that I've created. I'm not exactly sure what she said but it was something like, \"Can I read your essay? I just want to get the idea since I don't know where I will start.\" I was shocked at the situation and just smiled at her awkwardly. I just told her I'm busy and needed to go somewhere then she says that she will talk to me later.Unlike before, this time she is really persistent. She came to my apartment, called and messaged me constantly, and even contacted my friends and parents.  I don't know what's got into her. Last time it was just messages and sometimes I would ignore it but this time it's too much.I only contacted her again when she passed her assignment. I invited her to the talk at my apartment because I feel like this needed to be in private.During our talk she blamed me for getting a zero and a major offense due to using a.i and high plagiarism because I didn't let her read my work. She started to yell at me and  I was sobbing and hurt at her hurtful words. I'm thankful my roommate was there hearing us and dragged her out.Just yesterday, Iris decided to come to my apartment apologizing and I accepted it.

My mum also spends a lot of the time at her fiancés as she’s on night shift & my dog wakes everyone up when she comes in and out. My sister used to be a massive clean freak, side note my mum has said HE has until April but SHE can stay for how long she needs, but my sis takes that as her being kicked out also.I’ll do my best to keep it short, my sisters bf (Sam) smokes weed religiously, my mum made it  clear that he was to NOT smoke in the house and go out back. He is jobless and hasn’t paid my mum any form of contribution to him staying here (he’s on UC). Despite that he smokes it in the house & just opens a window. The whole house reeks of it & the course I study I could be kicked off for smelling like weed. That’s only the first issue. Bath water gets left in the bath, he won’t rinse the bath out, he won’t flush the toilet, they won’t clean after themselves, they leave food in the sink, leaves joint ends in the toilet/ sink/ bathroom, they feed my dog stuff he can’t eat,he spends min of 2 hours in the bath, the list can go on & on. Aidan had 3jobs  when him & my sister (Lacy) got together-all 3 good pay. She got a pay raise & magicly he lost all 3. Lacy tries to take all the fall for Aidan because my mum doesn’t like him.

Non of it is my mess yet I’m still the only one who ever tidies like always. Last week around Wednesday I didn’t have my study, so I cleaned the kitchen, for TWELVE hours & my kitchen isn’t even that big, that just how dirty it was. I went to my bfs for the weekend, I’ve came home, everything is a tip. Lacy was still at work so I’ve shouted of Sam & asked him why the kitchen was like that, he just gave me a condescending look. So I went on a rant on how he sits on his games all day when he could help clean up, telling him he lives like a pig, he could at least straighten the house, and get some respect for a house that isn’t his, ESPECIALLY since he’s not helping money wise and Lacy & my mum have a full time job & I’m in full time education. It was quite heated but it ended by me telling him to get out my face and to not speak to me. Lacy came home & about an hour later she’s screaming at me for being rude to Sam. I relayed everything I said & told her that she’s changed since living with him bc she would NEVER live like how they’re  making me live now, she called me a c*nt & now she hasn’t spoken to me since Sunday.

I have paid for, taken, and passed all the legally required hunter safety and firearm classes to be able to purchase my hunting license. I not only purchased my license but all the permits and tags I needed for my hunt. When my mom found out I had bought all my stuff she forbade me from hunting.Around Christmas I told my stepdad I was sad I couldn't go hunting and he said I should go because I worked hard to do it right and I was an adult. On Dec 30th I told my mom I was going to stay the with my bio dad's family with my dog for new years and she let me go. I spent the 30th with my bio dad's family, and then went hunting for 3 days. My stepdad and everyone on my bio dad's side knew where I was during my hunt.The problem is, someone on my bio dad's side posted a picture online saying \"good luck OP on your and [dog]'s first hunt!\" and my mom saw it. When I came back home after the weekend she was waiting for me and started yelling at me for disobeying and lying to her. I told her I don't understand why she decided to change her mind when she promised I could go if I paid for everything and did. She just walked away and refuses to talk to me until I apologize.I know I was wrong for lying to her about what I was doing but I didn't want to throw away all the money I spent on gear, classes, licenses, and permits for my hunt.

She let me pay for all these things but when hearing I had bought everything she decided to ban me from going.I enjoyed my time outdoors with my dog and our hunts, even if they all ended with no catch.

We both work a full-time job (I work 40 hours, and she works between 45-55 hours a week).Roommate wanted a puppy (small female Maltipoo). I said that I was fine with her having a dog, but that I can’t put up with a yappy, untrained dog. She agreed.Things were going okay, but I would notice that the puppy would only get about a 5-10 minute walk in the morning at around 7:30AM, whenever my roommate could get home for lunch (between 11AM-2PM), and then maybe once or twice after she got home (5PM-7PM). Mostly short walks. When she’s gone she leaves a couple toys that the dog gets bored with quickly.The puppy generally played well with my indoor cat (boy), but there were a couple times where she was very hyper because she hadn’t been exercised, and she would grab him by his neck with vigor. This freaked me out, and I told my roommate that the dog should get longer than a 5 minute walk in the morning before work, because if she has a lot of energy she could accidentally hurt my cat.My roommate agreed and told me that she would walk her dog longer in the morning. She didn’t. She was also unwilling to put the dog in daycare, to hire a dogwalker, or to confine her dog in any way unless my cat was also confined some days.Now, the dog is 8 months old and not potty trained, not house trained, barely leash trained, not kennel trained, and not obedience trained (does not listen to any commands besides the occasional “sit”). She pees/poops in the house frequently, peed on the couch twice, barks constantly, and has destroyed some of my belongings. Roommate is not trying to train her, either.The other day, my roommate did not come home at lunch to take her dog out, and so the dog was inside from 7:30AM-5:15PM, and pooped inside. When she can’t take the dog out at lunch, I’ll usually take her out, but she didn’t tell me that she was going to be gone that day.To me, an untrained 8 month old puppy should not be left loose in the apartment for close to 10 hours without a potty break. So when it looked like it was going to happen again the next day, I said that leaving an 8 month old dog inside for 10 hours is getting neglectful. It’s also dangerous for my cat.My roommate was very hurt by this, and said that it is not neglectful. She said that we have different opinions of what neglect is, that her dogs growing up were left inside without a potty break for the whole workday, and that she has to train her dog the way that she sees fit. She is annoyed by how much I complain about the dog. She went to a mutual friend’s house and refused to talk to me.I feel bad for complaining so much and using harsh language, and almost wish I hadn’t said anything.AITA for saying that it’s neglectful behavior?",

I told him I had to watch my nephew and my boyfriend didn't mind.I worked full time (42 hours a week) and watched my nephew during the day, brought him to work with because I worked with my parents, and was trying to find time with my boyfriend. On the days I would spend time with him, id sleep at his house and had to wake up at 4:45am to be home at 5. One day I woke up late and didn't get home til 5:15am, my dad went absolutely fucking bonkers. He kept saying I needed to focus on my real responsibilities and stop hanging out with 'that boy'. I would just agree and move on. But fast forward to September, I'm starting to get REALLY FED UP. I work and have to watch my nephew, I have no time for myself.Fast forward a few more months to like December of 22' my bf moves in and we have to start paying 600$ for one room, not an area, a room, in the upstairs of my parents house. Now that house has a lot of issues, the oven didn't work, the shower puny, and the bathtub leaked. I hated it, and so did my bf. Our relationship started to get toxic just by the house we were in. So I go downstairs and tell my parents I wanna talk. But my dad blurts out \"you don't wanna watch Jack anymore do you?!\" I nod and tell him I was tired of it. AND they were trying to pay me 3$ an hour for watching while I was working. He starts going on about how bad of a person I am, and how if I leave it will make things really hard on my parents. My bf says paying 600$ for a room is bullshit and my dad gets up and starts yelling in his face saying that he's disrespectful towards him and blah blah blah.I defend my bf because I want to and my dad started yelling at him. My mom comes out and says that I don't deserve to be payed for it anyway, and a whole bunch of other shit that I ignore. So I left that day with my bf. They started saying I was a bad person and blah blah blah. This happened a year and some time ago, so idk AITA?",

I have three autoimmune diseases, including celiac, and because of the severity of my other two autoimmune diseases, my doctors have me on a strict diet to try and keep my immune system under wraps.my parents are very old school, they think my diseases aren't actually as bad as they are, and they are of the mind set where if I don't want to (or can’t) eat what they're making, then I'm just going to have to suck it up, or not hear anything at all.one thing which is important to note, is that academically, I'm smarter than my brother, who is more street smart. this has led to my brother being coddled by my parents because they don't want me saying something about school or grades that would make him feel bad. they also don't want him to feel left out, or less cared about because I get higher marks. because of this, they always make his favourite foods. this is not my brothers’ fault in any way, I'm just trying to give full context to why they make the food that they do. I'm also indo-latino, and if you're brown of any kind, you know sons get favoured.I've been putting up with having to eat dinners that I’m not supposed to eat for a long time, to the point where my test results were getting worse. I was always feeling sick, so, I've started having 2 dinners, one in the late afternoon around 4:30, which I make myself, and one my mom made later. I usually make something like a tofu dish, Mac and cheese, roasted vegetables, and dressing, sometimes a simple curry. basically, food which is gluten free, and does not have anything I'm allergic to, or am told not to eat by my doctor.then, around 6:30, I'll eat a small amount of the dinner my parents make. even if it has something I'm not supposed to be eating or am mildly allergic to (I'll break out into hives, but no worse than that), I’ll still eat it. I'm not a picky eater at all, so it's more about food I can’t eat.I've been keeping to this routine for the past few months, and my parents have just started noticing, and called me out on it.they went on about how hard my mother and father work to make food for us, and how they both spend time looking for recipes, and don't get me wrong, I really appreciate that they do that, as well as all the other things that they do. but my mother has accidentally fed me gluten on more than one occasion, ending with me in the hospital hooked up to a bunch of wires.I know I'm young, and I may not be seeing the full picture, so I just want other people’s opinions on the matter. so, AITA?",

	"body" : "My mom’s house sold at auction at the end of April ‘23. On Jan 2nd ‘24 she was removed from the house. She texted me yesterday asking if she could stay with me. I had to tell her no, again. Despite all she has put me through, I still love her. My dad passed in June 2019. It’s been very hard on our family. Since his death the relationship with my mom has become strained. My brother hasn’t had a thing to do with her since Jan 2021. My mom would pit us against one another. It was a habitual cycle of distrust and manipulation by her that we have since worked through. My brother, SIL, and I have a great relationship since my mom is no longer in the picture. She blames us for her not paying her mortgage that we never knew she wasn’t paying. After the auction, she then had 10 days to vacate. Within those 10 days, she talked to the new owner and gave him her sad story. He felt bad for her and made a deal for her stay there 3 months and get her the surplus money from the sale of the house. She was supposed to use that time to find a place, pack, and move. She didn’t do that. After she got the almost 40k from him and the 3 months were up she told him to talk to her lawyer. It then went to court- she lost. She had until the end of Nov to leave. In total she had 8 months to find a place and move as well as almost 40k but still did nothing. During this time she has withheld belongings that was supposed to go to my brother and I after my dad’s passing. She refused to give us anything and would constantly make comments like “You don’t know what it’s like. You only lost a father, I lost a husband. My lose is greater than yours”. Those hurt. Jan 2nd she called me to come get whatever I wanted because they were kicking her out. She went next door and talked to my brother through the doorcam and told him the same thing. So him and I both left work to finally get our families stuff. I was then told by her that anything I took was still hers and I was just holding it for her. I told her no. Her and I argued and I walked out of the house in tears because I was so hurt and mad. She tried to have us arrested for getting stuff even though she is the one who told us to. After my SIL told her that we had her recorded on the doorcam telling us to come get what we wanted, she relented. Even after all that, I still helped her move some stuff to a storage. She ended up at a shelter that would help her find a place to stay and work with her. She has known since April that she’s not allowed at my house because my husband won’t allow her there after everything she has put me through. He has held me while I’ve bawled one too many times and can’t stand the manipulation and emotional turmoil she has put me through. She choose to bury her head in the sand and now wants to stay with me because she can’t find a place for her and 2 dobermans She is now threatening to come get the dogs even though she has nowhere to go yet, simply because she’s mad at me.",

She will do homework last minute and often ask for extensions with work.She had a tendency to remind me to pay for school related things like lunch money, just before I’m going to bed, or that she needs to take something into school so can we run to the store and quickly get it.Last month, I went on a wild goose chase to help Mia locate ingredients for her home econ class, after she told me at half 10 she needs xyz ingredients and she just checked the fridge and we don’t have it.She was reading the ingredients of an email, and when I saw it was dated a week prior, got annoyed Mia couldn’t have told me before when we did the big food shop for the family.I told her the next time she needs something for school to tell me the day she gets told or the day after latest, or I will not be helping her out.My husband has stopped helping Mia with her last minute requests and calls me a pushover for helping her out, but when she asked today to put down the deposit for a school trip I put my foot down.Mia has known since the start of the school year she had a school trip to Germany. Her school sent an email out two months ago asking for deposits for kids to secure their place on trip. It’s is about 150, and Mia asked me today to pay as the deadline is midnight or she may not be able to go.I reminded her what I said last time about deadlines and organisation and as she chose to tell me last minute I will not be paying for her deposit. She got upset as all her friends from history class are going.I told Mia that she can pay herself from her savings as she has a part time job, which is more than enough to cover her deposit, but she wanted to save up to buy a new game console.I told her to pick if she wanted to go on the trip or get a new game console and she called me an AH, and now I’m wondering if I’m being unreasonable. My husband is on my side but my youngest said it was mean and Mia is very upset with me.ETA- Mia doesn’t have ADHD, but she is dyslexic so this does explain the schoolwork sometimes, but she will ask for extensions on top of her extensions which is a sore spot for her and my husband who wants her to be more organised and not leave work last minute.Mia has been tested for ADHD and doesn’t not have it, I did my research at the time and realised it often gets overlooked for girls but even after getting another opinion she doesn’t have ADHD.

Yeah, we do make inappropriate jokes (which are basically us saying 'I'll put a traffic cone up your ass if you dont shut up and things like that) and slap each other's butts but we have been doing that for 2 years. He has been refusing and telling me to go alone but I don't want to since we only see each other on Friday, Saturday and Sunday and the DnD session is this Sunday.

	"body" : "Typically, I'm quite busy as a grad student, so I only get about an hour to myself at the end of the day sometimes before I have to prep for the next day and go to bed. During said hour, I often play video games. I'm very introverted, so my alone time is very valuable to me. Sometimes, I call my girlfriend (let's call her Jane) while I'm playing and talk with her while I play. She doesn't live with me, so it's how we catch up at the end of the day. Additionally, we are both aware that we sometimes will multitask while we are on the phone together and we are both ok with this.Last night around midnight, after Jane initially called me and we talked, she wanted to call again. She was depressed yesterday as well. Admittedly, I wanted to go ahead and go to sleep. I have to get up fairly early, my sleep is very important to me, and my social battery was pretty drained by the time she first called me last night. Further, her mood improved by that point and we had already talked about her depression in the earlier call.  It was our nine-month anniversary yesterday as well, but with both our busy schedules, we didn't get much chance to celebrate. This also influenced my decision. I felt bad telling her no, so I told her she could call me again.Twenty minutes later, she FaceTimed me back. I'll be honest: the twenty-minute time period frustrated me, but I tried not to let it show.  At one point on the call, I asked if she was ok. She said she was sleepy, so I told her she should go to sleep. She said no, because she wanted to talk to me. I told her I was going to go sleep soon anyways, which she seemed to be a bit upset about. I realized this, so I told her I'd stay on the call for ten more minutes. I figured \"ok, ten minutes gives her the extra time she wants, and gives me enough time to wind down to sleep at a decent hour\".Two minutes later, she suddenly wanted to hang up. I was already feeling guilty, because I felt like I wasn't being as patient as I could have, but I was also tired. I basically asked her if she wanted to hang up because of me. Long story short, through that exchange, she got confused and thought I said that I wanted her to hang up. She asked me if I wanted her to hang up, in a tone of voice that sounded hurt. Admittedly, I did not react the best to this. I got frustrated, and thoughtlessly rolled my eyes and sighed (I had forgotten she could see me) . In a tight, but not raised, tone of voice, I said \"no sweetie, I don't want to hang up, I want to know if you want to hang up\".This made her sad and this is the offense I'm asking about. My frustration in that moment was stemming from desperation and my own guilt. I felt bad because I was tired and wanted to sleep. I felt trapped because it seemed like no matter what I did, short of staying on the phone with her all night, I wasn't going to win. I wanted to know what she wanted. So, Reddit, AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for Using the Laundry Machine Too Much?",
	"body" : "This morning one of my roommates messaged in the group chat about our electricity bill being high. In the summer months, it's typically around $35. This month it was around $68. For reference, that is cheaper than last year, when we paid around $102. She said that she doesn't shower or do laundry much so she doesn't know why it could be high. Water is not included in our utility bill, but rather our rent, so I said that. I realize now that the laundry machine can use a lot of electricity, I just didn't consider that because we have a washer that claims to be efficient. Also, it's been very cold where we live. I said it's probably just the heating.Onto the issue at hand. I do about 6 loads of laundry a week: Towels, bedding, white clothes, athletic clothes, colors, and jeans. Maybe one extra load if I spill something on myself. By comparison, this roommate who messaged about the electricity bill does laundry maybe once a week. She never washes her sheets and towels. She's asked me once before why I do so much laundry, so I explained to her its because of my allergies. I'm literally allergic to dust so I have to wash my sheets and towels weekly, otherwise I get itchy. I also said that I do so many independent loads of laundry because I wash according to manufacturer directions. I spend a lot of money on my clothes so I want to keep them nice for a really long time, as to not waste money.I try to do my loads when no one else is in the house. If I plan on doing a bunch of loads back to back, I typically ask if anyone needs to use the machine before I start hogging it.Honestly I'm kind of peeved about her bringing this up, because she really isn't a great roommate. She consistently forgets to lock the door and turn off the stove. She and her boyfriend will cook until midnight at least three times a week (I have no issue with her using the kitchen, but she's very loud when she does it). She also leaves the kitchen a mess and doesn't do her dishes for days, making it really difficult to use the sink. She also goes out Thursday, Friday, and Saturday- which is fine, I'm glad she has free time - but its quite annoying when she comes back at 2 am and wakes me up by slamming the front door. She also doesn't contribute to any of the cleaning supplies unless specifically asked, and never restocks them herself because she doesn't have a car.The way that I view it, there's always give and take when you live with roommates. No one is perfect. Given I haven't actively been screaming at her about dishes and being loud, I feel that it's kind of unfair that she's complaining about my laundry usage.AITA?",

I've noticed my sister is getting more and more stressed over the past couple of months. I figured it was just from her pregnancy since she didn't have a good pregnancy last time. Little did I know what was really happening.Her husband is a major gamer. He spends most of his free time on his video games when he's not working. As I mentioned before they already have one kid. Well, he never pays any attention to his daughter, he rather play video games. So much to the point when my sister leaves the house for something and leaves the baby behind, he doesn't even know that he is home alone with the baby! (she tells him before she leaves). He refuses to help her in any way. Won't change a dipar, won't help feed or bathe the baby, or even just watch the baby for two seconds so my pregnant sister can take a half-decent shower. My sister is a stay-at-home mom because he wanted her to be while he does hauling. Sometimes his job requires him to be gone for a couple of days. Last week he was gone on a trip for 2 nights. When he got back the first thing he told my sister was: \"Good the house is clean, I would have had to hurt you if it wasn't\". Now my sister said that he was joking but that's nothing to laugh about. He also has been yelling at her about not being the same person as she was when they first started dating. Even though after they got married and had their first kid, he stopped trying in all. He used to get up and make her breakfast or even run a bath for her when she got home from work. But doesn't do anything close to that anymore. He doesn't even help with the housework, saying it's my sister's job to get it done. When he comes home and the house is still a mess, he yells at her \"What the fuck have you been doing all day besides sitting on your ass, this house fucking stinks!\" with offering NO help! When my sister is stressed out and needs a hand, he doesn't even get up to help. instead, he just likes to say \"Oh what's wrong with you today, something is always wrong with you. You can do it, don't need my help\".His video games have gotten so bad that they are now in financial trouble. While my sister is struggling to keep the lights on he rather spend hundreds of dollars on his game. My sister spent $100 on the baby the other day and he yelled at her for spending too much money and that's why they are broke after he spent $80 on Roblox. The baby needed formula and diapers!I'm worried for my sister. I could go on and on about stores like this but I would need a whole day to type it out.

(dunno why I am going with the disney theme, but whatever). anyway, about 10 years ago Elsa stopped talking to Anna and essentially cut her out of her life. Elsa married Anna’s ex and said that she constantly feels jealous of Anna’s presence and thinks she’s trying to steal her husband back. No matter that Anna herself is happily married to someone else with two wonderful kids. Elsa is borderline delusional on this.she put down an ultimatum: if Anna is invited, she will not be coming. and because Elsa is kind of the more popular out of our friend group, she essentially iced Anna out of all gatherings (pun intended).I keep in touch with both and i know that while Anna was sad initially, at this point she has let it go, and found a new group of close friends from work and life and she has really fun parties since her husband is also very social and loves to have people over.here’s the thing. I still like both of them, so for my birthday celebration I invited both. it was at a restaurant and I figured they can sit at opposite sides of the table and not interact for 2 hrs. the guest list was visible so each knew that I invited the other. Anna showed up but Elsa didn’t. she called me the next day and really scolded me on how I could be so insensitive and invite her mortal enemy etc etc. she said Anna is not a good person and a hypocrite and that she was always jealous of Elsa and always tried to bring her down and that she is super toxic. to which I said , she was never toxic to me, it’s my birthday and I invite people I like. Elsa hung up and is now not talking to me.was I the AH for inviting both?",

Being part of a large family I had 9 siblings involved in the wedding. Her two sisters as the remaining bridesmaids.  I planned her bachelorette party and paid over 2k for it. We went on the trip and I paid for anything she wanted. Once we were back E began ignoring me. I confronted E on three different occasions asking what I had done to upset her and to apologize.  E said if I didn’t know what I had done to upset her then I wasn’t sorry for it and wouldn’t accept my apology. I approached E’s sister and asked her what I had done to upset E.  Her sister said she didn’t know what it was and that she was probably stressed. The treatment continued and I finally told E that I wanted to withdrawal from the wedding and work on our friendship and that if she was willing I wanted to be a bridesmaid but until then I didn’t feel right being a bridesmaid with the current issues. E agreed and told me she would work on our relationship. After that conversation things were better. After that my sister and I were getting our bridesmaid dresses altered. They needed major alterations and extra material was needed. I told E to order an extra bridesmaid dress and that I would pay for it so we could use it as material. E said the dresses were discontinued and that we would use the hem scraps to alter them. My dress was being altered at a shop and my sisters by a family friend. My sister ended up needing a lot of material for her alterations and didn’t have any scraps. I asked E if she could get scraps from the alteration shop for us to use. My brother picked up my dress and was supposed to get the scrap material. He came home and my dress had been unaltered and no scraps had been brought home for my sister. When asked why my dress was unaltered he said there were no leftover hem scraps and that E said to cut up my dress to use the material for my sister and to use the remaining material for a new bridesmaid. I asked E why I was no longer in the wedding since we had an agreement that I would be since our relationship was better. E said she didn’t think I wanted to be in the wedding and told the shop to not alter my dress. My dad told E that if I wasn’t in the wedding our family wouldn’t attend. Once E realized we were serious she asked me to be in the wedding. We scrambled to get my dress altered and to find material for my sisters dress. We looked online and found our same dresses not discontinued. We got our dresses altered but E ended up canceling (for the third time)two days before the wedding. Our family was out 13k. E and my brother kept all wedding gifts. They will marry but haven’t set a date.",

	"body" : "I (25F) am currently planning a wedding with my longtime boyfriend of approx. 4 years. With that, I am currently picking out bridesmaids and my maid of honor. I asked one of my friends (24F) I have known since high school to be a bridesmaid. We have had an on/off friendship since we became adults. Albeit, I may have fallen short as a friend from time to time, but we learn, we grow, and we change. However, as I have been going through this process and planning out how I picture the big day, I don't see her standing up there with me anymore.Here's some history, between the ages of 18-20 I was in an abusive relationship. A lot of times when things were going wrong, I would reach out to my friend to vent and talk to her just for support. While in the midst of that, she took me off of all social media and stopped returning my texts. When we finally did reconnect, my older brother, who is friends with her as well, told me she said she stopped talking to me because \"she always had problems whenever we spoke\". We talked it out, I apologized, but it stuck with me that I can't talk to her about everything.A few years later I was 22 and had already been with my boyfriend for quite some time and I was having a really hard time with life. My boyfriend's friend (24F currently) was there for me and always gave me a listening ear and would even invite me out the house to hang out together or with her friends. I would invite my friend out to go out, party, the normal things 21 and 22 year old women do, but she would always say no. I would later see her on social media with other people doing what I invited her out to do. This made it easier for me and my boyfriend's friend closer and I spent a lot more time with her, she is always there. I wasn't aware, but my friend was seeing this and starting to feel left out. Again, she took me off of all socials and stopped returning my calls and texts again. This time I wasn't sure what I did wrong, but I figured, she had been separating herself for a while and she no longer wanted to be friends.Last year (approx 2 years since the fall out), again, my older brother was the bridge of communication and she said, \"she ditched me to hang out with her new friends so I left.\" Me and my friend talked it out and again I found myself apologizing and letting her explain her side, but never telling her how much it hurt me. At this point I felt like I just had to be there for her all the time, but not expect for her to be there for me.Once we got back to being friends, again, she found herself in a bad relationship and I supported her through it all and just stopped taking it personal when she went out with her friends instead of me. She got out of that relationship, but now she has a new person in her life which I am happy for her, but I have been pushed to the wayside again and my boyfriend's friend is there to pick up the pieces again. I am not sure what to do anymore. Please help!",

They were like brothers, always hanging out and sharing amazing experiences.

College friendships are super important, providing support and stability during those crazy young adult years. I’ve never met the best friend in person nor has he met me. The problem started when one day i opened my Snapchat and saw that the best friend had sent a request (I don’t follow him on any social media platform and I’ve never talked to him either). I didn’t think too much of it but decided that I should tell my boyfriend about this and that’s where it all went downhill. My boyfriend asked the best friend about this and the best friend got defensive and it turned into a fight in which the best friend called me a whore and some other bad names, which led to my boyfriend ending the friendship and the best friend blocking my boyfriend. I feel guilty bec if only I didn’t tell my boyfriend, none of this would’ve happened and they’d still be best friends. It’s not like he messaged me, it was only a Snapchat request which I could easily just deny or block his acc. I know deep down my boyfriend is very hurt. So AITAH?",

Two weeks in she sprung a surgery to remove her bunions on us and said that while she is out she is going to need us to pay the bills while shes out of work and stuff.After I moved she started treating my boyfriend and I horribly. She was being controlling and toxic. There was alot of mental and verbal abuse as time passed and she kept getting worse. She would constantly kick us out over small arguments. (who cleans more, taking jokes too seriously, amazon being charged to the wrong card.)We started looking into our own place because it was just starting to be too much for us. She brought up that she wasn’t going to have the surgery in November like she originally planned, so we kept looking for places. During Christmas, she brought up that she was going to go through with the surgery in February and is going to need our help. This wouldn’t have been a problem if she didn’t say during arguments that “she doesn’t need us” “she could take care of the bills on her own”.In the beginning of January we were given the opportunity to apply for an apartment thats move in ready and in our price range. After approval they can’t hold the apartment for long so we decided that if we get approved then we will be moving. We would have to move by March 1st. The best part about it is its in the same complex so we can still be near them to help out.My boyfriend told her about the opportunity and she went BALLISTIC. Keep in mind we haven’t gotten approved. She was saying things like “If you guys move don’t ever talk to me again” “You guys are just using me” “You're ungrateful”. She even threatened to kick us out that very same night after we told her. She had the nerve to throw and break her phone and call us childish.We don’t want to pass up this opportunity but we don’t know if we should stay or not. She has made it clear numerous times that she doesn’t need us and she can handle everything on her own. She mentioned that her boyfriend would be helping with bills and stuff during this time.

My girlfriend is a math teacher and we talked about her potentially hosting a review class for extra money in one of the meeting spaces.She asked me about certain dates that happened to coincide with a major town wide  event right next to the hotel - the World Cup of cricket. She knows that this is going to be the highest revenue generating event of the year for the hotel and that I have been strategizing about the best way to approach it and have been turning down many groups as to hopefully be the last closest option and be able to charge a premium. We have 3 meeting spaces and with all the guest rooms also comes meeting spaces whether for team meals, team meetings, etc. Even if we got some sort of media staff we can’t have 100 people go over load our breakfast restaurant at once so we push big groups into a meeting space with a breakfast buffet as Courtyards do not have a buffet. I have deliberately turned away any meeting room only business over those dates as to save my space for the right group.When she asked me about the dates I tried explaining the situation that teams or staff or media potentially need the space and she said why does cricket need meeting space? I explained what I just wrote above about how if we need to give all these people breakfast we can’t do it in our restaurant, team meeting etc. and that my bosses are expecting banquet revenue out of this somehow as well. She kept pressing me that she just needs a yes or no and I kept trying to explain the situation in hopes that she may let me off the hook.Eventually after a tense conversation I said no not right now I can’t risk losing 2 weeks worth of something extremely profitable because I have 2 days of your event and she wasn’t mad but there was tension. She said the way I handled it she just would have preferred a direct answer but it’s very hard to say no to your girlfriend of 7 years.  It is my job to make as much money as possible and it is not a huge conference center with 20 different spaces we only have 3.Am I the asshole for not being direct ? Or is she in the wrong for not taking the hint and forcing me to say no to her. In my opinion  after explaining it if it was me I probably would have said ok it sounds like the space is needed for more important things to your business ove those dates",

	"title" : "WIBTA For drawing nude art?",
	"body" : "I (23F) am an illustration student at an art school. I am currently in my senior year and getting most of my artwork ready to be showcased at the senior show. Along with our senior project, we also must create a postcard for one of our promotional items. So I had the great idea of drawing my batsona character I use as my online avatar in the baphomet pose. I titled the postcard as The Devil tarot card so it could tie into my senior project. I originally had the illustration drawn nude.For me as an art student, I didn’t see this as a problem. I had been in nude and life drawing classes for more than half of my time here at college so I was pretty much desensitized to this kind of art. So I thought this was okay with my kind of work. However just to be cautious in case, I had made a variation of the original piece. My variation had my batsona in a nun outfit. She still had a good amount of skin exposed, however some more sensitive areas were censored in this version.Before I continue, I am well aware that my mom is a religious person so I had an idea that she wouldn’t be too positive about it. Yet my mind couldn’t have prepared me for what she said next. I was courageous enough to show her the first clothed version of the art piece and she sorta liked it. But when I showed her the original one, she said that it was horrendous. I asked her what was wrong with it and she said just to look at it. Now I was sure she wasn’t going to be too much of a fan of the art but I think what made me really upset was that she never specified why she didn’t like it.She just called it horrendous and that was that. The real kicker is that I showed her some of my nude life drawing art pieces before and she was perfectly fine with them. I didn’t even have my character in a suggestive pose or anything like that. Then again I have been so desensitized to nude art, I just think of it as a way of expressing one’s own talent with art. This started my strike of not to show her any of my art until the senior show. I mean most of my tarot cards I have made have a lot of skin showing, so I wasn’t going to risk showing mom this work for a while.Now in present day, I had updated my postcard idea to having my batsona covering her breasts. I understand that even this pose could be provocative, but from looking at it so much I just don’t see it. I gathered some more courage and I showed it to her, hoping for her to maybe have a more positive attitude on it. She still responded with: oh…that…uh lovely… And then for her to stare at me. What’s the kicker is that I am also really proud of this work too. I spent a while on it and I have made sure it wasn’t pornographic or anything. I even checked with one of my professors and they said it is provocative but not pornographic. Which is good in my opinion. I get that raunchy art isn’t the best in an art portfolio, but I am just drawing a woman’s body.",

	"body" : "My husband and I have been together for over a decade. During this time he's been in therapy on and off. He had a hard time finding a therapist that was right for him. A few of his therapists early on encouraged him to just medicate (with no regular sessions) and one pushed religion on him. Neither of these worked. What he needed was someone to meet with him semi regularly, not push their religious beliefs on him, and instead work with him to develop appropriate strategies/talk through issues. Whenever he told me about one of these more questionable strategies (i.e. pushing 'just love Jesus') I said I thought that was inappropriate and he should find a better therapist and go without until then.There have been long stretches where he has gone without therapy because my husband isn't generally good at taking care of himself. That falls on me. I have to remind him to do things to keep him healthy/taken care of. Drink water. Eat more than once a day. There are literally times I have had to tell him he needs to brush his teeth. He also gets anxious making any decisions on his own. I have to help him pick out new clothes, write emails to work colleagues or groups of friends. He can't make plans for us- I have to make them all. Or, I should say, I have to help him make the plans so then he can say he made them.He's a good person. He loves me so much. But he is so dependent on me. It is draining. I have to spend an hour at least once a week talking him through whatever crisis he's having. Sometimes this crisis is over what new collectable to buy. A collectable for him. That I do not have any interest in.I finally demanded that he look into therapists again. I told him I can not be his therapist and he cannot depend on me this much. He needs to start taking care of himself and get a therapist that will work with him to develop these skills. And he did! Which is great. However a month into therapy he said his therapist had homework for me. I was supposed to write out a list of all his great qualities- at least a page or two. (Mind you, this is after YEARS of me carrying all his emotional baggage, essentially mothering him, giving him credit for things I did so he could feel better about himself, and one year, I did in fact write out 100 things that I thought were great about him for a gift.)I was so frustrated. I said no. I said therapy is his work, not mine, and I've spent too many years of our lives solving things for him. It wasn't fair to ask me to sit down and do this homework when the point of his therapy was for him to build his own skills without depending on me all the time. He was upset but accepted it, and said he understood. Well, just the other day he told me that his therapist doesn't like me. And thinks I should be thanking and showing him appreciation more.

Before anyone worried about covid we did not force anyone to come who was uncomfortable and restrictions were fairly lenient in my state by this time. We slightly rushed our wedding as my dad has several health issues and recently had a heart attack. I wanted to make sure he would be around to walk me down the aisle. Because of this, we didn't have much money for a wedding. It was less than $1500 counting my wedding dress and looked better than I could have imagined. We served homemade tacos for food and had water, juice, and soda to drink. We had our wedding in an art gallery so even hiring a bar and having people pay for the alcohol themselves was not an option as it was a small town gallery and had no built in bar. Most of the people in our families is Mormon so don't drink anyway. Therefore I didn't think no alcohol would be a problem. A few people brought their own and a friend even brought my husband and I some champagne to have which was appreciated. We didn't hear any complaints and assumed everything was fine. However, recently I have found out a ot of people were upset we didn't supply alcohol. A lot of people assumed I was pregnant and that was why. After learning I was not they were pretty upset and said I was an ass hole for making people bring their own. We never told anyone they had to bring their own and those who did chose to because they had asked if there would be any Alcohol. I do not believe I am an asshole for this but, after speaking with one relative who was very upset that I didn't have the audacity to say there wouldn't be any nor that they could bring their own I feel bad for not telling those who do enjoy drinking they could bring some. So am I the asshole?",

They also get a lot of visitors because it’s a beautiful spot. A few weeks ago my nephew (different sisters son) asked if he could come visit me over spring break so I said yes but needed to talk to the sister who owns the apartment. I told her he wanted to come down and she said she wasn’t sure because a lot of people like to come down at that time and she couldn’t guarantee that somebody else wouldn’t be down and to confim dates with her.  As that was the case I told her it was okay I can book an airbnb for that week and then there is nothing to worry about. Time went by and I didn’t confirm the dates but my other sister wanted to book nephews flights so we got them booked. I said something in passing to BIL about nephew coming down for spring break and went on my way. Today he mentioned something about it to my sister and she got so upset because I “didn’t confirm the dates and she told me she didn’t know if people would be using the apartment it’s a really busy time” I responded that I was booking an airbnb as she said it would be busy and people would be down so I figured it was easier anyway that way the apartment is free Andy nephew can still come for the week. She told me I was missing the point and now she looks like an asshole and literally didn’t speak to for the remainder of our 4 hour car ride. So reddit..AITA?",

The corvette has manual transmission so it’s usually me whos driving it. Both cars are his btw and I’m on insurance for both.Backstory: he asked me to haul a compact fridge from the place he’s renting out to the place we live in. It’s not exactly a mini fridge as it’s about 1/2 size of a regular one. Also the drive between places is 2 hours each way. He could’ve done it himself but he decided to sent me and I said I’ll do it if he gives me the suburban. He said I can take the suburban.Anyway I (a petite 27f) took the suburban and drove off. I’ll spare you the details of how I struggled to load the poor fridge into the car but eventually I did it and headed back. About halfway through my way back my dad called me and said he needs a car to get groceries. I told him I’m on my way back and I'll be there in an hour or so. He said I should hurry up and was displeased that I took the suburban even though he gave it to me.So when I came back he was even more annoyed because he took the corvette and ofc had chronic pain flair up. He said I loaded the fridge wrong and the cooling fluid could of spilled. It did not spill btw. Also he said that it was an ah move of me to take the only car he could drive even though he said I should take it and I should haul the fridge.Now I feel like ta because I took the only accessible car. On the other side he told me to take this car because he knew I won’t be able to load the fridge into the corvette. Also he needed the fridge to be hauled on that exact day.",

	"body" : "EDIT: thanks for the comments to far. but please read the details, this is not about the money but the fact that the house was made available to my parents in otherwise unattainable circumstances that they now deprive their children of.Original:my parents recently sold the house my grandfather had built them for them and me (38) & my younger brother (31) to grow up in. my parents had left us alone in it all day during our childhood (yet, this often was nicer than when they were home). later, in adulthood, they said this was to go to work to finance that house, i.e. prioritising it over us. I had developed severe depression and twice seriously tried to end my life.when the selling got planned, I pleaded for keeping or subletting the house a) as the financially sounder decision and b) since the house was built on old family ground that was GIVEN to my parents FOR FREE, plus the build was in large part paid by SELLING MORE OF IT, plus my grandpa was a mason and did most of the work, also for free. please note this! I was ignored.my parents have built a flat-pack house in the yard (despite the old house having a retirement-friendly, one-level flat!).after the sale, I asked whether my brother and me would get some of the money they got out of the sale. they declined, saying we would inherit once they're dead. that is also the legal position where they are. I'm however not interested in the legal part.I voiced my disappointment in their decision making, my pain, and also that at my current medical state, I have no perspective of outliving them, despite therapy. I also made it clear that my request was not as much about the money (they know that I am not broke) as it was about negating or honouring the childhood lack and my resulting condition.they asked me to shut up because the discussion were too painful for them.so now I am trapped in a position to either be the bad child once again, or shut up not to inconvenience my parents, but torment myself with thoughts about this situation (I don't sleep well, started smoking, have severe psychosomatic muscle spasms).aita for insisting and should I just shut up? other impulses?",

For context my aunt is slightly crazy, she claims to be allergic to everything, and normally I would be okay with the allergies until she told me if she didn't like something she would just say she is allergic to it. When she was asked for a full list of what she was allergic to she said her mom had the list and she didn't know. I immediately stopped caring as much about her allergies.My mom(40) on the other hand is severely gluten intolerant, like if she gets into it she can't move for days. No one on that side of the family will make any food she can eat. They won't even leave croutons on the side of salads for her.I had helped to make my favorite food for dinner, bacon wrapped water chestnuts, and my uncle lost it because his wife is supposedly allergic them. I argued back that water chestnuts are a kind of raddish, not nut and he stopped yelling but they wouldn't touch them. Fine by me, I got more.Later on I was eating a chocolate with Nutella in the middle and I gave my siblings (5 and 6) a piece. My uncle lost it at me saying that my siblings were going to be around his wife and make her sick and put her in the hospital. He was yelling but I didn't care. I said something along the lines of why should we tiptoe around your wife's diet, when she doesn't even know what she's allergic, but you don't even care if my mom is able to eat.My aunt ran out of the room crying and my uncle started yelling at me. My mom got in the way and came to my defense but the a lot of the family is saying I was in the wrong and should just have stopped eating. My mom told me I did nothing wrong and other family said they hadn't realized my mom couldn't eat the food and that they would do better.The family seems torn but I want an outsiders opinion.

	"body" : "For a little backstory I 29(F) moved in with my mom 54(F) a year ago to help her with bills and such due to her recent break up with someone she was financially dependent upon. Our agreement was: 75 a week for \"rent\" from me and my, 21(F), sister and throw what I could to a credit card which she had helped me out of a emergency situation with (completely understandable)at that time I was completely healthy. Now the past few months I've been going through some very unexpected health issues; I found out I have some sort of autoimmune disease through blood tests and have been thrown for a loop with everything. My physical and mental health have been rapidly declining and in turn has cost ALOT of money between having to quit a toxic job (so Im down to one full time job), going to the er (which makes me miss days of work and are unpaid), and paying for medication because I currently can't afford health insurance and am waiting on state assistance, buying gluten-free food for myself just incase part of my issues is celiacs disease and paying for specialists visits such as rheumatology and neurology. This is all on top of my normal monthly bills and I am far from wealthy I make about 500 a week after taxes; I have a 500 dollar car payment, 150 dollars to insurance and I have about 65 to 70 out in subscriptions the whole house uses and about 100 out in natural medication because I'm trying to stay away from pills and gas is like 80 a week if I'm lucky. At the end of the week I'm lucky if I have 20 dollars left over for myself alot of the  time I'm in the negatives. Now this past month I haven't been able to pay every single week I've missed twice on \"rent\" due to me missing work because of the er visits. My mom and I got in a bit of a spat because I was talking about going to a better paying job so I can afford my expenses. If I get this job I'll be making about 27 an hr a huge difference from what I am making now. As soon as I mentioned this my mom wanted to double my rent! I was floored! I told her absolutely not, the whole reason I wanted to change jobs (because I absolutely love my current job and would not leave it unless I absolutely had to) is so I can keep up on current rent and expenses and have a bit left over for myself, I absolutely refuse to give her ALL my extra money and have nothing left for myself I want to be able to save in case of emergency expenses or, idk, I wanna buy my own house. My mom has been down my neck for money lately but I'm tapped I have nothing left to give. My sis only works a part time min wage job and is also attending online collage I told mom she needs to ask her to get a full time job if she wants more money she sleeps till noon most days and works less than 32 hrs a week sometimes as little as 18 hrs. Mom said she dosent want to \"push her\" especially while shes in collage. I am at wits end I came there to help that is it, not be bled dry.",

	"body" : "2023 was a bit of a mixed year for me. On the positives I got an awesome new job with a significant pay bump, and completed a masters degree that I have been working on part time for the past few years. The low notes were that I hit a somewhat scary milestone birthday, and both of my parents were diagnosed with health conditions that will significantly impact their mobility and independence in the coming years. This has been a bit of a wake up call for me, and I've developed some anxiety about enjoying my health while I have it.It so happened that my birthday and completion of studies hit at about the same time, so I wanted to do something big-ish to celebrate. I love hiking so I wanted to finally do a multi-day hiking trip that I'd been considering for a while. When I decided on this trip, hubs was initially very annoyed about it, as it's not his type of thing. In general my husband is a bit of a work-a-holic, and most of our 'vacations' have been tacked onto his work trips (generally to nearby and uninteresting cities). He gets anxious if he is away from work for a while, and limited cell service is a no from him. I did offer to go alone (and pay for the trip from my personal savings), but eventually husband said he'd like to come, and we'd tack a bit of sight seeing on afterwards.After all was said and done, the trip was paid for partly from our joint account (which I contribute 50% to), and flights were paid from my personal savings.The trip ended up being mostly a success, however husband (as normal) took no interest in helping to plan, and left most of the booking and organisation to me. On my actual birthday he didn't organise anything (which I wasn't surprised about), but he also had scheduled two work meetings for that evening, meaning I spent my birthday in the hotel room with him on teams calls. When we got back he complained about the cost of the trip and demanded I send him more money from my savings account, which I did.The issue is, it is now husband's birthday and he's dropping lots of hints for big gifts that he wants. I spent about double what he did on me for Christmas presents, and have already bought him concert tickets, a cake and a picnic pack for his birthday party. When he drops these hints I remind him that he really put no effort into my birthday, but his position is that overall my birthday cost more and his effort was going on a trip he wasn't keen on.WIBTAH to stick to my guns and not buy the PS5 he's after?",

Due to age difference (and us basically hating that blended family), we were never close to Paul and had little to no impact on his life.Anyway, Paul is getting married to Laura (21) who is a very devout christian and has been pushing him to make an effort to “unite” our family.Laura has been using the wedding to try and get us to play happy family, at first it started with small annoyances like family chats and trying to get us involved in wedding planning.Originally Mike and me were just regular guest in the wedding but Paul asked us (as requested by Laura) to both be his best men, it felt awkward, but Paul never asked for anything, so we accepted.Last weekend we were supposed to go to a seminar (since Mike and I haven’t been to a church in years) to receive training on what to do at the ceremony, however it ended up being a set-up by Paul and Laura.When we arrived there was a Pastor, Laura, Paul, Mike and our parents. We were supposed to spend the weekend “healing” our family. Sara and Dad knew this beforehand and were on board, Mike, and I not so much, so we just left and opted to pull back from being part of the wedding, this upset Paul, he said that if we weren’t going as his best men, we wouldn’t be invited at all.This was acceptable to Mike and me since neither of us went to each other’s wedding. But now drama is everywhere. Extended family is contacting us to make us budge and all the circus that comes in this type of situation.

My sister has casually mentioned in the past how he showers once every 4-5 days because “he doesn’t really get dirty.”He has extremely strong BO and I don’t think I’ve ever been in a place with him where he did not stink. Even fresh out a shower, you can still smell very strong hints of sweat and…other types of smells when you’re standing near him. People have brought this up with her in the past, and every single time she just shuts them down and says that they’re looking for excuses to hide that they do not like him.One of our mutual friends is getting married in 3 weeks and it’s about 9 hours away from where my sister’s family and I currently live (we do not live together, but we’re about 15 minutes away from one another).My sisters informs me a few days ago that she will be riding with me to the wedding because their car is having some engine issues. None of this was discussed, she just informed me like she was relaying a message.I cannot explain to any of you how much I shiver at the slight thought of being in the same car with her husband for 9 whole hours. He does not like sitting in the back and will most likely ride shotgun. To avoid this, I offered to lend my boyfriend’s car to my sister, as he is out of state for the next few months and will not be using his car. She repeatedly said no, no matter how many times I insisted.So, I decided that the best choice for me is to just book a flight to the location and rent a car from the airport when I land. I have some points I can use to get a discount so it all works out.I tell my sister that I’ll be taking a flight instead of driving, and I told her that she can feel free to use either my car or my boyfriend’s car if she’d like to drive there. At this point, I haven’t booked my flight yet, because I wanted to inform her before I went ahead.She fully blew up on me and demands that I cancel my flight (because she thinks I already booked it) and says that we will be going forward with her plan instead. Continuous arguments led to the truth, where she lets it slip that their car is fine, they just didn’t feel like driving or wasting money on gas and tolls and were just looking forward to a relaxing drive across the country.I was tired of beating around the bush, so I just told her the truth, in a very polite way because at the end of the day, she is my sister and the person I’m talking about is her husband, so there’s no point in being harsh.She gets beyond upset and just blasts me with at least 50 texts about how I’m an A-hole. I feel bad about this but I’m truly conflicted.Edit: I forgot to mention, she is also texting the bride and informing her that she wont be attending the wedding because of me.

Nothing crazy, but I'm 5'11, and 170 lbs, up from ~145 in college. I used to have abs, but I haven't really cared as much about working out anymore, since I just feel comfortable in our relationship, and I know she doesn't care what my body looks like.We recently went out on a double date with some friends that I haven't seen in a while, Jack and Erica (fake names). We're all having a good time at dinner, joking around. Jack and I have known each other for a long time, and always tease each other, so he makes fun of me and says that it looks like I've gotten a bit chubby since we last saw each other. I laugh it off since that's how we've always been, and since it's not really true, I just have a slight gut now. His girlfriend Erica joins in and says that Jack has been working on his beer belly too, which Jack definitely has put on a few pounds recently like me. Jack says that we've both put on some happy relationship weight gain and grown guts. I say that I got the Boyfriend 20, joking that I've gained 20 pounds while dating my girlfriend. The conversation changed from there, but we were all laughing about it.Once we get home, my girlfriend says that I embarrassed her in front of my friends by saying that I said she made me fat. I get upset because she just inadvertently called me fat when I never said that at all, just that I had gained weight. I told her that I was just joking and that she shouldn't have taken it so seriously, especially because Erica was making the same type of jokes about Jack. I was also frustrated because she was making me feel bad about my weight gain, which I had never really cared about before. I told her that I know I'm responsible for myself getting a little chubby, but I didn't really care because I felt less pressure to look perfect while dating her. I guess this was the wrong thing to say because she got more upset.Am I the asshole?Edit: I weighed myself after making this post, and I'm actually 178 lbs right now, so a little heavier than I originally thought. I also have made jokes in the past about getting chunkier, but I've never used the word \"fat\" to describe myself, since I don't think it's true.A few of you were asking in the comments about my girlfriend's weight, and she's very healthy and has always been.

Claire and I have always gotten along and even talk outside of work however our relationship wasn’t nearly what I thought it was once promotions became a discussion. She came to me one day about a year ago and said that she and our manager were speaking about who would be promoted once our new branches opened up.He said that I would more than likely be his pick for AGM. She then told me that if I were to get that promotion over her she would quit. I hid the fact that I was hurt and just assured her that I wouldn’t take it even if it was offered due to my schedule. We discussed it further and I told her that the only management position I would consider was sales manager, and her face lit up as she fervently agreed. That was the end of that, or so I thought.Fast forward to a couple of months ago, our company took on a new system and our General manager tasked me as well as her to learn it. I did so quickly and our manager was pleased with this and spoke with me about us needing a new sales manager!That next day he gave me a spot in the back office and told me to organize it how I’d like and that this was now my designated area. I worked all day getting it set up and when Claire arrived to work and saw me sitting at the desk she turned to our current AGM and said “that’s it I quit”. I tried to talk to her and say that her time was coming and not to think too much of it but her demeanor towards me wasn’t very pleasant. I didn’t even get a congratulations.Fast forward again, she is promoted to a front desk manager. I’m super happy for her but she’s still not happy because her position doesn’t warrant a desk space and she would still have to stay with the front desk.

Shortly after every time I would come back to work from the weekend I would find things rearranged at my desk and I would be logged out of my computer. (I only locked it because it is very slow to log you back in if you log out.) I knew it was her so I asked her to please keep things the way they were if she was to use my computer. She of course became defensive stating that she only uses because she has to, she doesn’t have a computer. Which isn’t true, she has the front desk, but that’s not the issue.I came into work today on a day off to discuss some things and she was at my desk, my personal belongings were knocked over, her cup was sitting on the brand new full coverage mousepad that I just bought and she had random fast food sauce packets laid along the desk. I tried to ask her about it and she just said “oh I was leaving those there for you.” I just left because I didn’t want to say anything rude.I know it sounds petty but it feels disrespectful. AITA?",

	"body" : "Me, Andy, and Ryan. We're all guys, 16-19 years old, and we've known each other for around 8 years. We've never met in person only online, but we're tight.Ryan, the one I'm closest to, is struggling in life due to his own choices. Despite knowing him for so long, he hasn't disciplined himself for a better life. He avoids discomfort, takes the easy way out, and has no plans for the future. It's frustrating because he jokes about giving up after school, citing laziness as the main reason. I've tried to help, but he's resistant to taking life seriously.As time goes by, Ryan's self-worth takes a nosedive. Had a girlfriend, but he ghosted her 'cause texting felt like too much work. Now, he's deep into fantasy relationships with an AI on Character AI.His self-esteem's so low, he'd rather chat with AI than real folks. Tried giving advice, but it's like talking to a wall. It sucks seeing my buddy of 8 years turn into someone I don't even respect anymore.Once you hit rock bottom and settle in, any attempt to help feels like an insult. Why bother with discomfort for improvement when you're content where you are, at least in the present? I can't help someone who doesn't want it.His choice is his choice, and that's fine. However one thing is: Everyone argues, that's a given. But when you're trying to make a point with someone like Ryan, it gets tricky. If I'm wrong, I admit it – I'm not perfect. The issue is, even if I refute Ryan's point but still agree with his original idea, it always ends with him saying, \"No, you're right, you're always right, I'm always wrong.\"Even if it's something I admitted to being wrong about, the moment he feels in the wrong, he tries to paint me as a narcissist. It's frustratingYesterday for example, I got off a long day of work and college with free time to spare. I just wanted to spend some time online with Ryan and Andy to play games. We were going to play Rainbow Siege, and once we all got on, Ryan ends up not wanting to join because he's finishing up a story arc on Baldurs Gate. Understandable. If it didn't take him 40 minutes when I only had an hour and a half of free time. Of which he could actually save and leave at any time to come back. But still insisted on finishing out the story arc. I straight up called him out, called him a d*** for pulling that move. I've ditched stuff I couldn't save just to join games. His response? I should know he's like that by now. He even agreed he's a douche, throwing in the \"you're right, I'm always right.\"He basically wasted the free time I wanted to spend with him. If he doesn't wanna play, that's cool, but acting like that just feels toxic. Being real here, writing this, I might BTA. Maybe I'm the one in the wrong. Honestly, not sure what to do other than either bail and find someone else or bail and hope he stops being a jerk, maybe comes back with a bit more respect. Thanks for reading this sort of vent",

My ex was incredibly controlling and did not want me to have a relationship with anyone outside of our marriage.Once the divorce was finalized I decided that it was MY choice to include my family in my child’s life. I did not want to deprive my child of a happy childhood and positive experiences that he may be able to have with extended family and that includes my exes mother.

My ex confronted me about it and I informed my ex that yes, I was letting her (the mum) have a relationship with my child. I told my ex that it was my choice on my time with the child to visit extended family. My ex was mad, and has not seen the child since this happened.

A week and a half ago, I had to go to the ER. I was worried about someone taking care of my very emotional needy cat in case I needed surgery, so I called my mom to come pick me up and my cat to take me to the ER.It was a kidney stone and the pain was traumatic.I get my prescriptions and started feeling better but exhausted from the trauma that I went through mentally and physically. My mom kept on pushing her bf to be in my space and let me have my space while I’m healing. I asked my mom if he could back off to give me space and was told that I was an AH for not going out of my way to make him feel welcome.Sunday, I dropped a bunch of stuff at my apartment and ran some errands before heading back to pick up my cat. My mom was back at home when I went back. I had already avoided any social invitation from her and was trying to get out of there as fast as I could.

	"body" : "I (28F) and my husband (29M) had some friends come I from out of town and stay with us for a few days. My husband and I occasionally drink alcohol but not very often. Well, our friends came over and stayed for about 3-4 days, and revealed some information to us about alcohol causing relationship issues and some other things. We were respectful enough to not order alcohol if we ate out and we were careful to not mention alcohol around them as we know it can be triggering. Our friends flew home after a couple of days and we thought that everything was fine. I noticed that the one friend that usually speaks to me at least on an every few days basis was not responding to messages. I thought this was strange but let it go. After about 3 weeks of not talking I receive a message from this friend about how they will no longer be speaking to us and she didn’t specify why. It was a very vague message and to be quite honest it had me going through the entirety of their stay wondering what happened. These are friends that we have experienced a lot with and ending a long friendship so abruptly seemed weird. I let it go, and sent the friend a message two weeks later to ask if we could discuss this issue, as it bothered both of us quite a bit. The friend refused to speak about it with me. So, we figured that it was just over and we’d go our separate ways. A week later, I receive a series of messages explaining how upset and appalled they were with us for having alcohol in our house after the recent issues it had caused. For reference, we have a bottle of beer in the very back of the fridge and a liquor bottle in the freezer. During the visit, late a night one night the husband in the relationship drank half of the liquor and the entire beer. We didn’t notice due to not consuming alcohol often enough. This caused a fight between the two them and subsequently caused them to blame us for making it available. I understand that this can cause issues having it available, but for us to drink so infrequently it was an afterthought. I understand alcoholism is a serious thing, but should it be completely our fault if he chose to drink it?ETA: they stalled on telling us the issue, but the majority of our mutual friends seemed to know as soon as they got home. Our mutual friends live near us and these friends moved for work. It took these friends nearly a month to tell us the issue.",

It always felt weird to call them 'mum' and 'dad' but I did do it.Lennon and Dawn both work creative jobs, Dawn's an art teacher and Lennon's an art illustrator which I thought was cool and led me to spend more time with them, as I did GCSE art and they helped me with that. I've even started spending nights over at their house, which I absolutely love, the decor of the place, and the fact that it's a cottage with chickens in the back. As well as going on days out with them, to get piercings or to museums or anything that seems remotely interesting. It's really brought me closer to them and it led to me seeing them as Mum and Dad, and calling them that.I slipped up at dinner with my adoptive parents the other day though, and whilst talking about what we did on Saturday and I referred to Dawn and Lennon as mum and dad. It's really upset my adoptive parents, they said that they were the ones that had raised me for the last 17 years and not them. They said that Lennon and Dawn having me was irresponsible back then and that it was a good thing they were mature enough to choose adoption, but shouldn't be trying to force their way back in now.I told them that I'm grateful for them raising me, but Dawn and Lennon are also my parents, just because they weren't ready doesn't diminish any connection we have right now.I have been feeling bad about it recently though, as it has upset June.",

Here's where I think I might be the AH though:2 years ago, on Christmas, my brother (let's call him M) and sister (going to go with P) were with my mom, and I had just finished a long shift at work. I called P and asked where they were, and she said her house, which was about a 35 minute drive from where I was. I said ok, went out, and all the lights were off, so I called to have them let me in. P said I wasn't outside, which...yes, I am? P then asked which house I was at, and when I said hers, she laughed and said they were at my mom's house, that she can't believe I went to her place. I hung up and haven't talked to her since. (For context, my mom lives an additional 45 minutes away from my sister, so it would have been an even longer drive.)For the longest time, I held both siblings accountable for hurting my feelings, but ultimately, I realize M didn't do anything, but he was always pretty insufferable growing up, and did some awful shit that I don't feel right forgiving him for anyway. So I don't feel terrible about not inviting him because frankly he wouldn't care either. But I'll be civil with him if I have to be around him.I still feel hurt that my sister hasn't apologized about it yet, and through my mother I've heard she feels like she shouldn't apologize. I even attempted to have the message relayed through my mom to my sister about me talking to her because I want my nephew to be my best man - I love him to death. To know he won't be there is devastating to me because he was my little buddy growing up and is becoming such a cool person. But P thinks I'm only reaching out because I want her to do my hair at the wedding, which she refuses to do, and I really couldn't care less if she did or not.I have decided to just not invite either of them to avoid any drama altogether, but my mom said she's upset that they won't be there. I'm currently rebuilding a relationship with my mother, so should I just bite the bullet and invite them for her sake? Or WIBTA for wanting to just block them out completely?EDIT: Hi, everyone!

Doing so could bring our That to over $1000. background: I got pregnant while we were engaged but we broke up shortly before the birth. Based on the laws of our state I have full custody. We decided its best to split our time with them so we trade off weekly. We have no intertwined income and usually just pay for their needs individually. We agreed to trade off tax years but that was based on us sharing the work/cost of parenting. Thats not how its worked out. I live by myself with no real outside support. I do get help every once in a while from some family, but a good 85% is entirely just me. I pay all my bills and necessities. I rarely get babysitter. Luke does not pay child support which I have not requested.Luke lived with his family in an inherited home for the last 5+ years and has only recently decided to move out because of “boundaries”. He didnt pay rent. he paid some bills, but they were split among the other adults too. He doesnt make as much money as me but the largest reason is because he hasnt been able to keep a job.We’ve been attempting to co-parent which is not without its hardships. Luke has made it clear that hes been attempting to get out of parenting. He has repeatedly tried to excuse why he shouldnt take them including but not limited to: saying i have to keep them if they are sick with a cold my week so that it stays in 1 household only to say I should take them HIS week when someone in his house got COVID because the kid “probably didnt have it”, seeking late shifts/overnight jobs so he doesnt have to be home while they’re there, trying to find a job across the country that would keep him away 6+ months at a time because he said it was good money, and most recently saying the household is too toxic and not safe for HIM to be in. Because of the last reason, Luke has moved in with his new gf. He claims that he still sees our kid regularly, but after speaking with his family, he might get them from daycare 2-3x a week, but leaves soon after while the family takes care of the rest. There was even a few weeks after the most recent fight where he ghosted us all together. So while on paper we trade off evenly we really dont. Last year we had a big fight about this because Id claimed our kid the last 2x. This was hard for Luke because of the child tax credit and COVID benefits that he didnt get, so I can understand that. Its important to note that Luke has another child from a previous relationship and he claims them every year. Yes the family is picking up the slack for the other kid too.In order to claim our child Luke needs me to sign away my right but our mutuals have suggested NOT to let him and that he can stick with just claiming his first kid.

It was very unpleasant, but I wasn't going to mention it. When my parents held my baby, he'd smell for the rest of the day until I washed his clothes and bathed him. I just put up with it without comment.Then my sister Ruth moved back in with my parents. She uses marijuana medically for a chronic pain condition. She has been helping my parents to renovate their house and is doing a lot of improvements, as the house was falling into disrepair. Meanwhile the smell was growing. There were holidays and they gave us gifts. The wrapping had the smell. Then the gifts. I had another baby and moved into a new house. The clothes and toys they gave the baby reeked. Gifts left on the porch were so pungent that we always knew who they were from. I've visited a few times. It's looking nice, but I can smell the house from the street. When I return, I have to wash before my family will come near me.On Christmas Ruth made cookies. My brother Ron (m 38) immediately asked me if they were \"special\" cookies. No one wanted to eat them. Ruth then spent countless hours making macarons for my dad's retirement party. Ron and his wife both tasted the macarons and didn't want any more because of the herbal aftertaste. I felt terrible because my husband and I didn't want them either. \"We just don't really like macarons,\" Ron told her, sending her home with dozens of uneaten cookies.Ruth wants to bring the house back to its former glory. I asked her if she was going to fix the odor. She said there isn't one. I admitted that her cookies tasted like the house smells and she became infuriated, insulted me, and gave me a chance to take it back and admit I was lying. I told her that I can't stand to see all the hard work she's doing go to waste because of the smoke damage. She works so hard, is so thoughtful, and spends so much money on baking, gifts, and home renovations. Endless smoking indoors every single day for years on end is taking its toll on the house, and no matter how well she seems to clean it, the smell never leaves.She has stopped talking to me. It's been a week and I've also told my mother about the smell. She doesn't believe me and doesn't care, but is demanding that I apologize to Ruth and that I lie about the smell, saying that I must be wrong. Even if I do that, I'll still have to continue washing and/or throwing out anything they give me, and I still can't bring my young kids there until it's dealt with, so this \"argument\" is just going to keep happening. It's a huge growing elephant that no one wants to accept or acknowledge, and I'm not really sure how to proceed. As the middle child, I've always been a huge people pleaser, but with the help of recent therapy, I've been trying to be honest and establish boundaries for myself and my family.So Reddit, AITA?

One let’s call Lexi for privacy reasons, Lexi constantly comes to class, absolutely stoned. There is never a day where she’ll come to class sober.So I think y’all can imagine the type of person she is and how terrible she is to work with. Off-topic but in the certain class we have the thing called animal care we get paired up with another person to take care of a certain animal. Such as, bathing that animal, feeding the animal, or just doing cage cleans.I think you could tell where this is going. I ended up getting partnered up with her, the entire time she was leaving to talk to her friends (she’s the popular type) or making a fool out of herself. There was even a point where she mishandled one of the animals we were doing animal care with because she was clearly intoxicated.I’ve tried reporting her multiple times, to where nothing ever happens. Honestly last Friday is where I was at my breaking point. She not only came to class stupid high, but also drunk. To the point where she couldn’t stand up straight. And I was left to do all the work. I literally had to leave class later to finish up because she literally couldn’t do anything.So that following Monday I refused to work with her in front of her, I explained to my teacher, everything that was going on to where I was yelled at for bullying? How in any way shape or form was I bullying her by not wanting to work with her? anyways, I really been looking back on the situation and thinking maybe I could’ve handled it differently because of the gravity of the situation.

	"title" : "AITAH For asking my supervisor a question?",
	"body" : "BACKGROUND: I work at an airport and one of our jobs is cleaning the airplane. There’s a certain supervisor that has always picked on me since I’ve been hired, but luckily we haven’t worked together for the past couple weeks because we’ve had different schedules—until tonight. He recently changed the cleaning process and it now takes twice the amount of time to clean.1st INCIDENT: I asked my supervisor why we’re doing it this way when it takes much longer and he responded by saying, “you’ve done enough already, you can wait outside”. Keep in mind this is after I had cleaned so it wasn’t like I was sitting around refusing to work and complaining. My coworkers agreed that I had asked my supervisor in a respectful tone and was very cordial when inquiring why we were using this new process. He continued to give me attitude and while I was walking away from the plane he yelled, “look at you, first day back and you’re acting like this!”, I kept walking because I didn’t want to escalate the conversation. I also haven’t been on vacation or missed any work so I don’t know what he’s talking about when saying it’s my first day back.2nd INCIDENT: Later that night in our official work groupchat we were asked to vote for an employee of the month. The supervisor that has been problematic votes for a guy named Brad (he is white, this will matter later on)…he then sends a text afterwards saying “The only white boy who works and doesn’t complain”. Clearly referring to me because I’m the only other white male that works in our department.QUESTION: I don’t want to work with him if he’s going to continue picking on me and throwing passive aggressive comments towards me. I don’t have isssues with any of the other coworkers, and they enjoy working with me— so I’ve made sure I’m not the delusional one here. What should I do? Should I try talking to HR? Are his comments in the work group chat acceptable for a supervisor?Any feedback is welcome, thank you.",

	"body" : "It feels kinda depressing writing this, but lately I don’t know where to turn. My (24F) boyfriend (25M) does not work or attend school. I am a full time student completing my last year of undergrad & first year towards Master’s degree (enrolled in both). I also teach two classes, which isn’t a ton but when combined with student leadership positions, it adds up. I have no free time essentially. Most days, I am out the door by 7AM and I don’t get back until 7PM if I’m lucky, then I have homework and grading and yadda yadda yadda. In short, I’m exhausted. I get so excited when my day is done and all I can think about on the drive home is getting to see my partner and relax together a little. And it’s practically impossible to get that from him. He knows what time I get home everyday, I’ll ask him to be ready to hang out when I get back, and yet I walk into a silent apartment at the end of each day because he’s been locked in his office playing video games the entire time i’ve been gone. It sucks. I get home and spend another hour or so alone waiting on him so we can figure out dinner and actually see each other, and then it’s right back to it after dinner. he’ll stay up until 4AM gaming from there. Recently, with the winter blizzards, it’s been nearly impossible to get all my stuff in the door without having to set it in the snow to unlock the door because no matter how much I knock he won’t come help me. It’s breaking my heart. I work so hard and do so much for him. I don’t get why it’s such a huge ask that he wrap up gaming by the time I’m home. He doesn’t do anything else with his days, you’d think it would be an easy task but maybe I’m just expecting too much. He makes it seem like such an overreaction whenever I try to bring it up.

	"title" : "AITA for changing my mind after I promised someone?",
	"body" : "AITA for changing my mind in hiring someone?I was recently hired in a job where I can appoint people to certain posts (positions of trust and confidence). Basically, since I am the one in-charge, I can bring/hire people I trust.  One girl (let's call her LENY), helped me during the application process for another job (not the one I got). When LENY learned that I got hired for a different job, she asked me if I can hire her for the vacancies in my new job. Since LENY helped me in my previous application to that other job I didn't get, I promised her that I will hire her for one of the posts in my new job. Take note that she is very qualified. In fact, she is already working at a higher rank position but she is willing to be demoted after she accepts the new job from me because she will be  nearer to her hometown.Since I was new, I'm still learning the ropes so I have not hired anyone yet. I likewise want to wait until I am settled before I accept applicants. I heard from one of my friends that LENY applied to another post near her hometown. I am happy to hear that and honestly wish that she gets the job. I thought she is no longer interested in the job I promised so I did not send her any message anymore.LENY didn't get the post near her hometown so LENY sent me a message just recently and asked me when I will be accepting applicants for the new post. I told LENY that I want to settle to the job first before I open the job vacancies (i don't even have my first salary yet). After I told LENY about that, LENY suddenly sent me long messages about her wanting to be near her aging parents and her health concerns. Her exact words in the end was \"If you don't  want to hire me, I can't do anything anymore MA'AM (MY NAME)\". I felt slighted by the tone of her message and the capslock that she used in her messages. I felt that she is angry so I stopped replying. Then she went on and on about how she is a good worker and how she had perfect attendance record (all of it, she sent in WhatsApp). I did not reply because I felt offended. I felt that she is pressuring me to open the vacancy when I am not yet ready to do it yet. I realized that even if she is not angry and I merely misunderstood her, I felt offended by her voluminous messages so I don't want to hire her anymore.The position she was aiming is a position of trust and confidence. I will be needing someone who will loyally assist me and will not betray the accounts we hold. The person that I need to hire have to be with me most of the time. By what LENY just did, I currently feel that she is not the proper person for the job. I felt turned off and I don't want to hire her anymore. It will be very awkward for me to hire her after that and I don't think I will have any peace of mind working with her.  AITA for changing my mind?TLDR, I promised someone who helped me before that I will hire her for a position of trust and confidence. She sent some messages which felt offensive to me and I felt that I cannot give that trust to her anymore so I now change my mind. AITA?EDITED the post to change the name to LENY (not her real name).",

He took the day off to take me (enlisted in Navy so days off often aren’t easy to get). He dropped me off didn’t stay to see the ultrasound the first one he’d be here for. He was to play online game because he doesn’t much time after work. Except he does all night barely sleeping a few hours and ignoring me all evening and my 2 yr old daughter who’s only known him as daddy.It took a while doc appt ultrasound doc again, and I waited for him to come back and pick me up. After an hour I tried calling but he was gaming online and phone line was busy. I couldn’t call his cell phone because basic base phone only allowed call for base phone numbers. I waited another hour. The nurses got worried for me inflet self consciousness and moved down by the exit. Another hour passed.At this point been there five hours. Three of them waiting for him. The nurses near this clinic asked if i was okay. I said I was waiting on huby he had the car ten more minutes then I decided to walk.It was 2 maybe 3 miles home. Outside was 110 degrees, I had trouble walking it was awkward. It took 30 minutes to cross the parking lot. I was out of breath. I crossed the street and stop in the shade of seedling tree barely any shade but i needed it. Ten minutes later I barely made any progress I was dripping in sweat.My dress is almost see through because of the sweat. A few men stopped offered a ride. I was scared said no. 20 minutes later I barely made any progress. I was trying so hard  to not cry. I was in so much pain. Hotter than hell and about to pass out. A women pulled over offered a ride i waved her off she asked how far I had to go and when I told  her dark skin paled. I hadn’t made it even a half block in the hour and few minutes I’d been waddling. Before pregnancy I was 110 pounds now I am 130 while this may not seem like much I was huge in the belly area and walked more like a penguin.She said my face was beat red and since I couldn’t breath she’d call an ambulance if I refused.Crying and feeling to much pain I got in. I knew the dangers off taking a tide with strangers. Hell that lady summer news was a military wife offering another lady who was pregnant a ride and she was kidnapped cut open left to die while her newly premature baby was kidnapped. But I got in because at that point death was preferable and I felt my husband deserved to have me dead and our son missing if this happened to me next.She simply drove me home i thanked her and went inside. He was amazed I was home he didn’t realize I wasn’t home yet. Didn’t know I was gone six hours.  When he had the car. We didnt fight i didn’t talk I showered and went to bed. We haven’t spoken in a week. He thinks I am being petty considering in 6 weeks he deployed for six months. Two weeks before I am due.",

I texted my landlord at about 5:30 asking for a spare and then got caught up in hosting and drinking at the party. As the party was ending I realized I hadn't heard back from my landlord. So I reached out to the person i'm seeing and asked if I could stay over. I've been with this person on and off for about 3 years. For the sake of this story, i'll call them my partner. They told me they were headed out but suggested I go to a KeyMe kiosk (it stores copies of your keys that print on demand) which was perfect because I had zero intention of screwing with their plans. The problem was I didn't have my wallet, but I convened with them and they really helped me out. We decided that I would get cash from an ATM, to buy a gift card, to use on the KeyMe kiosk and they asked me to update them on my progress.I then spent about the next 3 hours walking across Manhattan. No stores would sell gift cards using google pay, the rest wouldn't sell them after 11pm, and when I finally did get one and made it to a 7/11 that was actually open, turns out the kiosk doesn't accept gift cards. So at this point, about 3am, I am nearly frozen & defeated and get on a train to head to a 24hr McDonalds. I hit my partner and ask if they're headed home, if i can stay over. They agreed and left Manhattan to meet me in Brooklyn where we both live. I stayed over, and next morning they went with me, bought my spare key and lunch the next day. They were amazing and I let them know I was infinitely grateful.Today the situation came up (for context, it was a digression from another conflict we were already having) and they accused me of being selfish that night. They feel like me not checking in with them like we agreed meant I had no regard for what they asked me to do and that was selfish. I explained to them that I did not want to bother them or screw with their plans that night in the first place and since i was confident (at the time) that there was a finish line in view, I figured would just let them know once I had the key.We went back and forth a bit and ultimately. I told them I completely understand their point about adhering to what we agreed on instead of doing something different regardless of my reason, and that I will be cognizant of that moving forward, but I don't agree with the assessment that I was being selfish when my intent was the very opposite. So I wouldn't concede to that label, which was upsetting to them. I argued that the substance of the point that they made was completely understood so whether or not it should be labelled as \"selfish\" is something that we can agree to disagree on. They do not see it this way and that further perpetuated the conflict we were already having. Am I the asshole?",

When my sister came to stay with us she wasn't very well, mentally or physically. The doctors had told her she was borderline diabetic. I decided that we could work out together and eat healthier. I also decided to quit smoking. During this time we were going through 2kg of sugar a fortnight. My ex and I used to joke and say she must have been getting into the sugar not nice I know. I was drinking tea to help me stop smoking which really did help btw, but would have a sugar substitute. Found out my sister was putting sugar in my tea when she made them for me. She disclosed that she had being doing it on purpose to see how much sugar she could put in before I noticed. Obviously I was quite upset when she said that and was pissed off about it for quite awhile.A few years ago my sister said that she was sorry and that it really upsets her when I bring it up. After a long conversation about it, I apologised for bringing it up and said that I would let it go. I haven't brought it up since.Now, My sister and her daughter have been spending a lot of time with us and came up and spent Christmas with our family we have a new baby.

I told her she can talk to whomever she likes.A few weeks later she rang me, I told her I wasn't in a good mood as I was tired from the kids and that I was a bit hurt by the way the message was worded. She stated that she is working things out and just doesn't know who to trust, and that she loves all her sisters. I said that I know she won't listen to me after she has been told by two psychologists who told her to cut her out already. I was angry and said it isn't that hard to know who to trust. She then brought up the tea thing and said that I went on about it, says that she feels the same thing about me as she does with my other sister. I was pissed off, I said wtf. I said why are you bringing that up now. I said that looking back I was justified to go on about it since she had tried to make me fat. She then denied that she said she did it on purpose. I know for a fact she did say it and it was the premise of our past arguments. She said she is sick of people messing with her reality.

Which also means we would just pay for each other randomly and then at the end of the day just give the money back.But after few months I began to see small changes. She started to say things like, \"I'll pay you later... I don't have money rn I'll pay once I have money... Etc etc...\". I am a very shy person so I get embarrassed to ask for my money back and with her if i never asked my money back she wouldn't pay me.So this one time we 4 friends decided to order food online. I payed for everyone and then after calculating each person needed to pay me 90Rs. But Sam asked me for 50 more Rs as she wanted to order something else.So she owed me 140Rs which she didn't pay me back at that time. Everyone was okay with it but I was not, I knew if I didn't asked her now she would never pay me back. So after asking her 3 times she sent me 90 Rs and told everyone about it.I then reminded her about the 50Rs and she got really angry about it. She was like, \" I already payed 90 Rs why are you asking me for 50 extra...\" I told her about her side dish and even showed her the bill. The cherry on top moment started here. She started to cry in front of other and later payed 100Rs to me and said, \" Take as much as you want I don't owe you nothing now.\"Everyone even tho knew about everything sided with her and she started telling them how she is poor and never has money so she takes my help. And how I insult her every time.Everyone told me to stop acting like that with her. I was really hurt. But this same incident happened again and she started crying and this time it was for only 20Rs. I got really frustrated.After few weeks i decided to live solo and leave the pg we where sharing. I asked Sam and she was okay with it but when it was time for me to move she asked me back for 300 something Rs that she owed me and i thought if she could ask me back the money I should do the same.I payed 300 and asked her for 1000 Rs which I payed for her to our landlord as her rent. And this is how I become the asshole in front of my friends as she again started crying and telling all our friends how I am insulting her over money.Am I the real asshole here??

About a year or so into their marriage, our mom started to hint at a new sibling.So you could imagine our surprise when our 40 year old mother who never wanted to marry or have a third child,tells us she’s indeed pregnant.My first thought was “isn’t this a bit soon?”We were happy for her but we didn’t want a new Sibling. Fast forward to when the baby was born, there were getting divorced.he had took the money they both saved for my mom’s maternity leave.So my mother couldn’t even enjoy her pregnancy & had to go back to work earlier than planned. This is where the problem comes in. David is basically nonexistent now. My mother is a nurse, working 8-12 hour night shifts,picking up whenever she can. While I’m a full time student & PT Operations Specialist.I started to work less hours to help her out with the baby. Since my brother had little experience w/ newborns.Left me to care for him when she wasn’t home with him.This continued for a year BUT now I feel guilty & have this growing resentment toward my mom for it.She depends on me to help her with everything.It got to a point where she would tell me not to pick up shifts so I could watch the baby more while she worked or if she wanted to go to work early for extra money. Mind you, my brother is capable to help at this point but doesn’t unless I’m not available. I never minded helping her & I’m the only person she can rely on for help.she praises me for being so helpful,but as soon as I complain about how I think it’s unfair that my life had to completely change & revolve around a baby that’s not mine.while my brother got to just lock his door ,make messes,video games all night and sleep in til 5pm, suddenly it’s “why is everything an argument with you, Why can’t you just say okay mom”.It’s like a slap in the face & makes me not want to help her.when it’s kept me from working,no sleep ,less studying, or things that make me happy.I have also  been diagnosed with Severe General Anxiety&MDD,so taking care of the baby is very difficult of me, paired with the stress of trying to get a masters in psychology&pressure to move out. My boyfriend has been more involved after noticing increased my stress level.Recently She started  talking badly about him saying“he’s a guy with nothing going for himself,I don’t know why you waste your time”.Yet He goes out of his way doing things like buying food for the house,gas in my moms car for her,groceries,Fixing things around the house ,fixing her car.All without being asked or paid for his services. So her saying that about him INFURIATED ME.Now I have been purposely pointing out her hypocrisy, putting my needs first & refusing to do anything that will not benefit me.

I thought I could sell it online for more money however my close friend from back home is always complaining about how some tops don't go down to her size in stores and everything is usually too big so I called her and asked her if she wanted it and I would post it to her and she could send me the money since it was such a nice dress.

Another reason I don't think it was a big deal to drop it is that my dad would have heard my preffered name being called, and it just wouldn't have been a good time for anyone.The ceremony was yesterday by the time i post this, and it really WASNT a big deal, my aunt ended up being there for my cousin and sent my dad a picture of us from my mom, and later on my mom sent him a video, which i expressed frustration about, because he soon after texted me that I guess him and my stepmom just weren't invited and insinuated i purposefully left them out of it. I told him that I specifically remembered mentioning Tuesday and he shut me down and just told me \"no\".I have to see him tomorrow, and I'm beyond anxious about this. Aita?",

The school has a block schedule, A days having my first 4 periods, and B days having my other 4. This last Monday was an A day, the day on which I have math class. I usually have about 30-60 minutes of homework every evening before A days. Also, my family has no designated “family time” and never has.It was Sunday night, and my family (dad, stepmom, stepsis) and I were watching the Obi Wan Kenobi star wars series, and had watched 2 episodes (a little over an hour of time) consecutively while/after eating dinner. After the 2nd episode, my dad turned off the TV (around 9pm), at which point I said I had homework to do, and went to my bedroom.Just shortly after doing so, I heard my stepmom practically yelling at my dad over her feeling like she was being ignored and her time not taken seriously. I also heard her saying that my dad should put me on a stricter homework schedule, regardless that I am a straight-A student (a point my dad brought up throughout their argument). My dad also said several times that “if this is how he (me) wants to manage his time, I can’t stop that”. My stepmom continued to argue, and state that she was extremely frustrated. My dad tried his best to diffuse the situation while still defending my decisions.After about 10 minutes of arguing, my dad eventually comes to my room and tells me to communicate with them about homework better, to which I said that I have always done this on Sundays when I have math the next day. He seemed like he agreed with my reasoning, but still just asked me nicely to communicate better in the future. I said that I would.I had completely finished my homework by 10pm, and had time to watch more star wars, but when I asked my stepmom, she acted cold towards me and was visibly angry. She ended up going to bed shortly after, and barely talked to my dad.She has started talking to me again, but I still feel like she’s giving me the cold shoulder, which I feel is silly for something like this, especially when she never even talked to me directly about it.TLDR: I did homework during “family time”, and my stepmom got extremely angry at my dad and I.AITA?",

	"body" : "My roommate Jake recently asked me to beta read his book for him. I was pretty excited about it because I knew it was something he'd been working on for a while. Honestly, it wasn't bad. The world building was interesting, the character arcs and development were great, and it is a nice long fantasy book set in a complex world. There were still some issues, a lot of it grammar and spelling, but this was still his rough draft, so I expected that.Aside from some minor things such as a few inconsistencies and out-of-place world building, the biggest issue by far was the humor. Jake is terrible at trying to be funny. He has his moments, but especially in his writing, it comes out forced and cringy.The biggest issue for me was one of his characters would often talk about wanting to masturbate or talk about how he recently masturbated. It was often out of the blue, during serious moments, and even the few times where it did kind of make sense, such as at a party where the character was drunk, I thought it was disgusting and unneeded.I told him the positives first, and he agreed with the spelling and grammar issues. However, when it come to the humor, he was deeply offended. I don't think I was too harsh, but maybe I was. I said something along the lines of, \"I don't really understand the humor. To me, characters saying they need to masturbate and talking about how much they want to do it isn't funny.\"He got really defensive and said I was flaming him and essentially being a bully. I said that he asked for critical feedback, and he retorted by saying that he meant spelling and grammar issues as the book was his vision and I was just being mean and I shouldn't say anything negative. I almost laughed at that, but I contained myself.I again said the book was good, just that the humor didn't work for me and he didn't like that either. He said he got the idea from Rick and Morty because apparently Morty talks about having to masturbate a lot.

I learn over time that my suitemates don't like sharing much of anything. not their food, trash cans, cooking oil, or even dish soap.about a week after i move in, I'm cooking something in the kitchen. while I'm cooking, my suitemate \"Anna\" approaches me, telling me that it is her stuff. she says, \"can we talk about how much of my stuff you're using?\" to which I reply, yeah, I'm using your pan and spatula. I won't use your food. she says okay and leaves. she later texts me saying that she'd really rather me not use her pans. I tell her it's a bit ridiculous for everybody to have their own pots and pans in a shared kitchen. she tells me she's not budging on this and that I didn't clean her pan properly. I apologize profusely for not cleaning her pan right. I agree I won't use her pots and pans. when I buy my own pot and pan, there's barely room in the cupboard for it, but I squeeze it in.about a week later, Anna texts me telling me not to stack my dishes on the drying mat on top of hers if I don't clean mine properly, because it could gunk up her stuff. by this point, I'm suspicious. I KNOW that I cleaned my dishes properly. I check after she texts me this, and they're just fine -- certainly not messy enough to drop gunk onto her dishes.

	"body" : "This past Christmas, my mother got my daughter \"Amy\" (4F) a doll she'd been asking for. It's a baby version of Mirabel, from the Disney movie Encanto. It quickly became her favorite.My husband's cousin \"Nat\" has a daughter I'll call \"Julie\" (6F). I wouldn't classify her as \"spoiled\", but she does have a tendency of disobeying other people.There have been numerous occasions in which I asked Julie to do something (\"please sit down\", \"please don't touch that\", etc.) and she either ignored me or went behind my back to do the opposite. While I understand that she's a child, Nat rarely makes any attempt to educate her daughter or correct her behavior.Last week, Nat and Julie came to visit us with some other relatives. Julie saw the Mirabel doll and asked my daughter if she could play with her. Amy refused. Julie protested, but I spoke with the girls and managed to get them to play with other toys.Some time later, the kids sat down to watch TV while me and the others got dinner ready. When we went back to the living room, Julie was gone. After a short search, we found her in my bathroom. She had taken not only the Mirabel doll, but also my nail polish carrying case.Julie had used my nail polish to paint the doll's hair, face and dress. It covered most of her facial painting, matted her hair and ruined her clothes. Amy saw what happened and was devastated. When we asked Julie what she was doing, she said she was giving the doll a makeover.Nat and Julie left in a hurry. The next day, I asked Nat what she planned to do about it, she suggested that the girls apologize to each other (Julie for painting the doll; Amy for not sharing it in the first place) and \"hug it out\", and offered to give me a couple new bottles of nail polish.I made it clear that Amy didn't need to apologize, and while I didn't care about the nail polish (they cost $4 and Julie didn't empty the bottles she used), I did expect Nat and her husband to replace the doll.Nat refused. She said that it wouldn't be fair for her to waste money over an \"innocent mistake\" a child had made. She also doesn't think Julie should be the only one apologizing, as none of this would have happened if Amy had agreed to share in the first place.I asked her twice, she said no both times. Finally, I called her husband and explained the situation. He apologized profusely and agreed to buy Amy a new doll. He stopped by on Saturday and gave it to us. He also brought Julie along and made her apologize to Amy.Apparently, Nat and her husband fought over this, as she kept insisting that Julie was just a child and they owed us nothing. So now, in addition to saying it was entitled of me to expect a new doll, she is blaming me for their fight.My husband is on my side, but my MIL thinks I should apologize, as this has blown out of proportion and I could have dealt with it more gracefully. She also thinks it was wrong of Amy to refuse to share.AITA?",

Any sort of 'alternative' aesthetic he tries to go for is shut down. He's not allowed to stay out with his friends past 8pm, and Gail seems to think that our relationship is unhealthy because we hug each other, and because he once fell asleep with his head on my lap.It was his birthday recently, I took him up to Manchester for it. At one point, we ended up going into Affleck's, and at the back of one of the shops is a piercing studio. As I had a fair bit of money on myself, I offered to pay for him to get a piercing - he ended up getting his lip done. We even bought him a clear retainer for when he has to go to school.His parents were not pleased however, and Gene texted me about them getting very upset over it. Last time I came over to their place to see Gene, they started berating me for not asking their permission beforehand, saying that if he got an infection his placement could've been jeopardised, and that I had no right to make that call on allowing him to modify his body.Personally, I saw nothing wrong with it, I mean he's old enough to decide if he wants a removable piece of metal in his face or not.

My dad did some bad things family-wise a few years ago that have definitely stuck with me, but he has made up for it and has sorted his own issues out, and hasn't messed up since. I have also started my own (very) successful side hustle/business but have not told any of my parents (feel like I am not ready to yet), so ontop of school and upcoming finals my free time is very limited.On with the story, a few months later and a couple thousand in profit later and things are going good, but as of a few months ago it is all he ever talks about. And these aren't in-depth conversations he is trying to make, IMO it's the most useless, mind numbing convo, he will talk about the same thing for sometimes hours, he will repeatedly ask me to do the most basic things that he never even tries to do himself (even if I am busy/ill). If you nod/say yes instead of giving a detailed sentence as a reply, he will keep asking you again and again until you either cut him off repeatedly, say it loud, or give a full detailed essay as a reply. I vividly remember being sat down getting on the game and being on call with friends openly speaking, and then he came into my room, sat down, and talked for literally 2 hours about the same 2 things literally more than 10 times whilst you could literally see the game going on my screen. This is all he ever talks about, literally nothing we ever speak about is about anything else, it's all \"business\". I feel like he does not know how to receive the message of \"just leave me alone, I will help when I can/when stuff actually needs to be done\". I also feel like he thinks that after I am finished with school that I will just drop everything and help him out with what is essentially a side hustle full time, or at least go into further studies about something heavily related to it. It has gotten to the point where I literally dread him sitting in my room, as I know I am about to sit through what (I feel like) is going to be a minimum 20 minute convo about stuff that you could probably come to a conclusion on in 2 minutes.EDIT: messed up judgement bot - this is why i feel like I am the asshole: The reason I'm wondering if I am an asshole is because I've literally started to physically avoid now, whenever he sits in my room sometimes I'll \"get up for a glass of water\", or when he tries to talk to me in the living room I'll be \"going to eat in the dining room\" (sometimes this is actually the case).

He has trouble standing up after sitting for short periods and has physical ailments affecting his back and one of his feet. This is at least partly due to not doing any exercise for most of his life despite my occasional pestering (ironically he was a medical doctor before he retired).My father recently inherited a large sum of money - the interest it earns in a high yield savings account each year is more than my annual salary (and my income is in the top 2-3% of US households). Even without the inheritance, he is well off with an 8-figure net worth and lives frugally.He's taking a trip soon where he will be on a plane by himself. The flight will be 17+ hours one way and 15+ hours the other. I procured a business class ticket for him on miles in one direction, and we got into an argument over the ticket for the other direction. Business gives him a better seat, more space, and a bed to sleep on during the long flight.He refuses to buy a business ticket the other way because it's too expensive. I don't disagree with him that a business ticket is extremely expensive, but I believe he's at the stage where that kind of money simply doesn't matter, and his health matters more. He's in a privileged position where the added cost of the business ticket simply doesn't matter. He could lose $100K in a ditch and his life wouldn't change one single bit.His reasoning in his words: \"I was brought up in a different era and from young I was taught to be thrifty by my mother. Changing long standing habits is a challenging process and try as I may, I cannot bring myself to spend over $10000 on a single ticket\". He normally complains about his health issues but now is saying that his health isn't that bad & 17 hrs in economy was fine.I think he lacks perspective and he's a hypocrite about money (he doesn't manage his money at all and put the inheritance in a bank account that earned almost no interest for 6 months until I found out and did the work of opening a new high interest account and moving the money into it for him, my mother manages all their other finances). He raised me to work hard but I don't know what the point is if you can't also enjoy the fruits of your labor. He says I'll inherit the money when he dies so I should be happy he's not spending it, but I always told him that I'd honestly be happier if he spent the money on taking care of himself and enjoying life.Also, I'm an only child living abroad with my family and I'm increasingly resentful that he doesn't take care of himself. When he inevitably runs into serious health issues, I'm going to have to deal with it.After a heated argument on the phone, I got angry and gave him an ultimatum that if he flew economy, he could do it both ways and if he ran into any health problems on his trip he was on his own and I wasn't going to help.

I don’t trust him to clean up the entire thing.So I tell him to forget it and I’ll clean it up once I’m done changing hineys. I’m sooooo irritated at this point. Not just because of the water everywhere, but because we have a counter top ice maker and there’s literally water underneath it. My fiancé hears the commotion (he works from home) and comes to the kitchen with towels and we get it cleaned up. Meanwhile my dad just walks back to his room without even so much as attempting to help.AITA for being irritated over this? Again, I know it’s not my dad’s job to watch or take care of my kids. But I was literally in the middle of changing my daughter’s diaper.",

	"body" : "Me (23F) and my bf (23M) have been dating for nearly a year, we moved in about after 5 months of dating. I feel we’re so compatible. We just get each other. Early on in the relationship we suffered a few blips. He is neurodivergent, this was a new thing to navigate as he hadn’t been in a super serious relationship before. He has seasonal depression, adhd and believes he has high functioning autism. He loves to debate and consequently argue. Last night we were watching a recommended show of his. I had just had a new iphone delivered and was finishing setting it up- organising my new homepage, whilst watching the programme. He doesn’t like when I’m on my phone when we’re watching one of his recommendations. I regularly  avoid doing this. He believes it takes away from the experience of watching movies and that I can’t do both. I somewhat agree, if I were to be scrolling on social media but in this instance I wasn’t. I was setting up my new homepage. He pauses the TV and says ‘are we watching this or what?’. I say ‘yes, I’m just organising my phone screen’. (Not super happy at his tone and abrasiveness though). After the show is done, I say ‘hey, I don’t want to argue but I don’t appreciate the way you spoke to me then’. He starts to tell me that it was ‘rude, distracting him from the show, and that if it was important we could just pause the show. He asks can I not watch something without being on my phone for an hour?’ I say, ‘I don’t want to argue about this, I gave you the opportunity not to be a dick and you’ve just became defensive with me.’ I walk away, not wanting to argue. He attempts to explain that what I was doing is rude, it takes away from what I’m showing him, I wouldn’t do the same in the cinema so why here?, if it’s important we can pause, if it’s not then I should stay off my phone. I tell him that I was enjoying the show, that it was a mindless task of organising my Home Screen and I was still watching it and enjoying it. He disagrees. I tell him that I don’t want to be policed in my own home watching tv after work, sometimes I’ll want to go on my phone. I could maybe understand his frustration if it was an organised date night- where he shows something he loves, we make an evening out of it. But it was just, ‘what do you want to watch?’ And ‘idk, you pick’ kind of situation. I really don’t want to feel like I can’t be on my phone when we watch tv, it makes me feel like I have to give it all my attention, which becomes more of a chore than a nice thing to do together. I do enjoy his recommendations, but I’m not willing to not go on my phone (the little times that I do) just to prevent a blown up argument. Am I being rude and disregarding his feelings?",

	"body" : "I (33F) have a two kids (11F and 8M) with my husband. Our daughter is usually a good kid, which is why we were appalled when we got a phone call from her teacher about her bullying another student.Her teacher told me that her and a few other girls she is friends with were bullying a boy in the same grade,  but in a different class at recess. A few of the boys in her class are friends with the boy, they were playing basketball at recess when he asked to speak to his friends.He told them my daughter and her friends were bullying this boy because he is transgender. The other boys immediately went to the teacher to tell her, even though he asked them not to because he was scared of the social consequences.When my husband and I found out about this, we were furious. It’s also personal for my husband, he’s a teacher and a baseball coach and he has a student who’s an 8th grader and is a trans boy, the boys on his team are friends with this boy and while he doesn’t play with them, he helps out with a lot of the behind the scenes stuff (like equipment, acting as a scorekeeper at games). He knows how much both his players and the trans student admire him.We told our daughter she was grounded until further notice, she lost all electronics, she can’t see her friends outside of school, ect. It’s school and home, that’s it.We got the phone call about a week ago. Last night, we were at my sister’s (37F) house for dinner. My daughter was there but she could only read books, no playing video games with her cousins or brother.My sister asked what happened and I told her, and she said I was being too harsh on my daughter and that I should lift the punishment on her.My sister’s oldest is her daughter who is 14. Her 14 y/o is a massive trouble maker, back in 7th grade, she got suspended from school multiple times for participating in the “devious licks” trend, stealing a hand sanitizer from the school bathroom and when she got back, she tried to steal a mirror. My niece also has got in trouble for bullying and recently attempted to shoplift but her brother/my nephew (10M) noticed what she did, told her, and she put it back before she got in trouble.My sister and her husband never punish their daughter, they figure “the school already punished her enough” when she gets punished at school.I told my sister I punished my daughter so she didn’t turn out like her daughter. I yelled at her for disrespecting my parenting. We got into an argument and it left in my family leaving early.Later on last night, my sister called me to work things out, she demanded I apologize, but I refused to do so because I think she’s the one in the wrong, but she keeps telling me she won’t speak to me until I apologize.AITA?",

I don't get payed enough to work harder.The bonus isn't even that much and to be fair I didn't care since I wasn't working full year and had no way of getting it anyways.In my opinion my colleague could have requested to swap shifts with someone else and I would fully understand.

But to reach the bonus you'd work way faster and the bar gets raised if too many reach it. I don't know how much the bonus is but it's not even half of an extra payment.

The residence of the seller was only a 15 min walk from my apartment so she agreed I could meet her there later that afternoon. When I arrived at the door she brought me the chair, she seemed really nice, we made the exchange and I was on my merry way.Like I said, my place was not far so I decided to walk the whole way with the chair upside down with the seat resting atop my head. Upon arrival, I put the chair down in front of my desk and sat in it. Something was off. The wheels wouldn’t move; the chair wouldn’t roll. I turned the chair over and examined it. There were no locks, like some chairs and tables with wheels have. I wiped each wheel down, greased them up but were still all jammed. It was obvious after a good look that not just one but three of the four wheels were busted.I do realize that I’m a fucking ninny nob for not checking the wheels on the damn chair before leaving her house and giving her the money. She was just a nice, little university student, I didn’t expect her to be a double-crosser. Nonetheless, I messaged her right away and was polite about it at first, basically saying that I’m sure it’s an honest mistake and I’ll be happy to come over again right now with the chair and get my money back. She flat out refused and assumed that I had broken the chair somehow on the walk over. Of course I tried to argue my side and explain to her everything in a civil manner, but she proceeded to refuse, saying that she’s moving to a new apartment and she can’t take the chair back, nor return the money.At this point it was no longer about the money, it was about the principle. This is when I took on a more obviously frustrated tone, but without being menacing. I asked her if she knew the chair was broken and accused her of intentionally ripping me off. She only replied with more accusations that I must have been the one to break the chair.The next thing I said was the only mean thing I said throughout the entire conversation, which was, “your parents must be proud of you.” (Not that bad if you ask me). Ok, I might have said, “This is bullshit” once, but for the most part I was being a cordial cupcake.She immediately blocked me and about 20 min later I received a message from one of her friends. They told me not to make any more attempts to contact her and to stop threatening her or else they would call the authorities and give them all my FB information. But where was the threat? Wtf are the authorities gonna do?I know for fact that a lot of you must get mixed up in all kinds of marketplace shenanigans and tomfoolery… am I the asshole?",

	"title" : "AITA for spreading my grandfathers ashes?",
	"body" : "TL;DR: I spread part of my grandpas ashes at my family’s plot after his wife cremated him behind our family’s back.I (f19) grew up very close to my grandfather. his daughter, my mom, raised me and my siblings as a single mother and Grandpa was a big help throughout my childhood. Him and our family have always decided that he would be buried in our family plot (where my late grandmother and great grandparents are).After my grandmother passed away, Grandpa remarried to “Doris”. Doris is nice and all but she hadn’t made much of an effort to connect with my side of the family. She’s made some slightly insensitive comments about my late grandmother at family gatherings. I’ve always blamed it on her being a little tipsy or something. Other than that she’s pleasant, and always welcome to family gatherings and holidays.My grandfather died in the hospital after a 4 day coma and my family was devastated. Doris was bedside for his last days and handled most of the paperwork. However, she decided to have him cremated without consulting my mother or anyone from our side of the family. In fact, she lied about having Grandpa cremated, and compromised with my mom to have him buried in a local cemetery so she could be close to him.We only found out that he hadn’t been buried when Doris showed up to our home WITH HIS ASHES in a grey urn. She said it was a last minute decision and that she couldn’t imagine a life without him and now he can stay in the house etc. etc…While she and my mom were arguing and calling family members, i took a portion of his ashes, drove to our cemetery and spread them at our family plot. I didn’t think anyone would notice but i guess i hadn’t closed the urn properly and i confessed to what i did when Doris confronted me. I told her it was a “last minute decision”. She’s furious and insists that she’s never speaking to our family again. No one else in the family knows and I don’t think Dorris is going to reach out to them, and my Mom is glad that at least some of him is in our state but wishes I could’ve done that with her permission/knowledge. I definitely could’ve handled that better but AITA?Edit: I see that I was TAH here. In that moment I think I was just kinda knocked sideways that no one other than Dorris knew he would be cremated. Me and Grandpa talked about what flowers I would leave for Grandma when he passed and couldn’t bring her any anymore. We talked about how I could stack stones and shells by his headstone like we did when I was little. There was nothing that would make me think he’d change his mind. But now it’s over and done with and while I was an AH for doing what I did, I’m a little glad that a part of him is still here. As for Dorris, I emailed her an apology, haven’t heard back. My mother is negotiating to have a portion of his ashes to keep here but we haven’t heard anything yet, which is probably my fault for taking that liberty and spreading his ashes anyway.

During this time, I won't be able to talk to him at all for the next several days (phone policies + being busy with the competition). Thursday at our usual time is the last time we would be able to call before I leave.This is where the problem started... After I told him how I wouldn't be able to talk to him for several days and how Thursday would be the last time, he asked to call earlier in the day on Thursday (mind you, I have classes/office hours earlier so this makes things very hard, at least to talk our usual amount of time).

He said that a video game was coming out during the time we usually start calling and that he'd like to play it then.I started arguing with him saying he can wait an hour and a half until I have to leave to begin playing. I didn't see why he had to start playing it the literal second it came out. He argued back saying that he'd been waiting for this game for years and that he wanted to play as much as possible before he went back to work (he goes back the day I come back. In other words, he has nothing to do all day except game while I'm gone). I explained that he can play as much as he wants while I'm gone and he'll have extra time especially because we won't be talking like usual. But he's completely refusing to budge on this. He says that he offered to call earlier that day and if that doesn't work for me then we simply won't call at all.Honestly, I was very angry. He knows how much time and energy I put into this. He knows that I am extremely nervous considering it's the first time I've ever flown out for a school competition. He knows that I've never been a captain before and that this is a really huge deal to me.I accused him of prioritizing the video game over me and he just agreed to it and didn't really see the problem. He says whenever I miss a call, that I've prioritize something else over him but I don't really see how that makes sense? If he ever told me he needed me or was not okay with me not calling, I would 100% cancel to talk to him (unless it was something I literally can't get out of).He said he was done talking about this and that his decision was final and I'd have to deal with it and then he hung up on me.

We have a schedule that we have to adhere to, there are rules we have to adhere to. I didn't make these rules, I'm just forced to follow them. Not doing so can result in disqualifications. For those saying it's ridiculous that I can't spare an hour a day to call during it: I am able to call once I got back to the hotel!

A few days ago my mom sent me an unprompted picture of my very sick grandmother in bed with no context, or anything. I was in the middle of grocery shopping when I received it and it really upset me & I instantly burst into tears in public. One, because it’s an upsetting picture to look at, she was very visibly not well & this has been a stressful time of (unfortunately) waiting for all of us. Two, I think it was super distasteful to take a photo of someone in that very vulnerable moment. I said nothing about my grandmother and responded to my mom “Sending this was inappropriate” to which she went on to talk about how upset she is, how I’m being insensitive as to how she feels, I’m an asshole, etc; I understand we’re both working through the feelings of grief, both of my mom’s parents passed about 15 & 20 years ago. So my step dad’s mom is all she has left (my grandfather passed in 2022). I have felt very torn feeling like I was mean to my mother and upset her when we’re all clearly going through the motions of preparing to lose my grandma. At the same time, that was really upsetting for me to see with no context especially in a public space.",

	"body" : "So a little backstory: I (18) work at my local pub. My Mum(M) and her fiancé(LL) are the landlady/lord and I have been working there since I was 12 after school/ college part time. Since September I have been working 6 days a week full-time to save money while I take a gap year. Now I may be extremely biased here as I had some bad history with both my mum and her fiancé so I’m genuinely wanting outside opinions. Since Christmas I have been doing our staff rota which was previously done by LL as he “doesn’t care, just wants it sorted”.Recently we have had issues with staff attitude especially with our younger staff so LL asked me to change the rota and remove our two waitresses(W1&2) and have just him and me do food service on a Sunday(Sundays are usually our busiest days). He never works FOH and is our chef 5 days a week. He spends most of his time either upstairs gaming(LL and M live above the pub) or in the kitchen and I have honestly never seen him work on the bar for longer than 15 minutes.So this happened last Sunday. We run Sunday roast 12-5. He came into the kitchen while I was double checking an order and announces he is finished because it is quiet. This is at 1:45! I rolled my eyes and he saw. He immediately goes, “Why are you rolling eyes I’m the boss I can do what I want.” I responded, “You said you wanted to do a Sunday service why are you going upstairs halfway through?” He said back, “ I think you forget that you don’t have any power here. I can do what I want so I’m going upstairs you can manage without me.” I’m not going to lie I can and did manage without him but the principle of the matter is what bugs me. So I said back, “You asked me to put you on Sunday and take W1 and W2 off and now you’re not even going to work the shift?” He left the kitchen and as he left he said, “you know I have worked 7 days this week?” (Which really pissed me off as I have been working 7 days a week since September as a half a part time job as well as the pub. I worked 3 shifts with him that week as well and he closed the kitchen early 2 times so was only working for about 2 hours max each day) and went upstairs. I turned to my mum and asked her “am I wrong?” She didn’t respond so I went back out front. The Food bell rung and I went back to kitchen to get some food and my mums’s phone is blowing up. I look at her phone and he is calling me a bitch and asking her why she didn’t stand up for him? Wtf is he 12?!? My mum complained that she was now “getting it in the neck because of me” I told her “it’s because he lazy and it’s not fair on his staff”Annoyingly it was really quiet after he had gone up stairs so I don’t really need him. So where I think I might be an arsehole is shouting at him in front of the kitchen staff and letting my past issues cloud my judgement. AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for cancelling my sister’s visit even though her therapist said she needed a vacation?",
	"body" : "About three years ago, my stepsister Daphne got pregnant. She and her husband Jim were thrilled, but found out at the 20 week scan that the baby had a congenital condition and would be born severely disabled (apologies if these are insensitive terms, I am not sure how people prefer to say it?). Daphne decided to keep going with the pregnancy despite Jim’s protests and they split up, but got back together by the time their son Liam was born. He is now 2 years old.Over the last two years, Daphne’s (and Jim’s) mental health has declined significantly. Daphne used to be a positive and pleasant person, but now it’s impossible to have a conversation with her. She is malicious, envious, and flies off the handle at any perceived slight. When I was having my child, I didn’t speak to her for most of the pregnancy because of how bitter and narcissistic she was. We don’t live close to Daphne so rarely see her in person, but I heard she was getting worse from our parents. In early November, Daphne had a mental breakdown. She trashed Liam’s room completely and vandalised Jim’s car in a fit of rage. This was enough to finally get her moved up the waiting list for mental health services and she started therapy. She reached out to me during this time and we had a few conversations and I invited her and Jim to visit my husband and I for a vacation at our beach house in March.Then we saw Daphne and Jim over Christmas and it was awful. Daphne could keep herself in check for a couple of hours, but then she would revert back to her old self. She would swear constantly, and while I know Liam can’t understand her, I think swearing at kids isn’t okay. Whenever I expressed concern for her she would just snap that I need to get off my high horse about having a “perfect” child. Jim was snapping at her constantly. He would also constantly ask to hold or play with my child, to the point it got annoying. Overall, the whole Christmas break was just the whole family being anxious over the situation.My husband finally said a week ago that he didn’t want Daphne and Jim visiting, and I agreed. I called Daphne and said that something had come up with my husband’s work and we needed to cancel the trip. Daphne was furious. Apparently her therapist had been saying how good this break would be for her (they haven’t been on vacation since having Liam) and I owed her this one thing to help her. Eventually she gave up and said I was a horrible person for pulling the rug out from under her and hung up.I feel bad if I’m derailing her recovery, and even my parents think I shouldn’t have cancelled, which is making me rethink things. They saw how absolutely horrible she was to me over Christmas, they saw how obsessed Jim became with my child, and they still think I should have put that aside, and they’re not normally the “keep the peace” people, so maybe I really am in the wrong.

I was told I would be with her brothers in a joined room, which in most cases I would be fine with but I explained to her that I need a bit more help right now going through meds and therapy as it has all just came onto me.She told me she would ask her friend if she was comfortable with me swapping rooms and we would have the triple room, however she chose to not say the reason why and instead explain that \"there is absolutely no problem if not and there won't be a problem if you say no\", to which her friend replied that since she didn't know me that well she did not feel comfortable, I understand it could be a little odd however I would be on a complete separate bed of 3 and on the other end of the room, I even offered to shower and get changed in a different room so I would strictly be there to sleep and to get some support in case of a panic attack.She dismissed my concerns by saying her friend was anxious about having me around, and if that I was having a panic attack I should simply get up and come to the room in the middle of the night, you can guess why that wouldn't work. I genuinely do not understand the massive care for her friend when all I asked was to be able to sleep in that room in case I needed help, literally all I want is the support on the night time as that is when I'm most prone and have been told meds may cause this for the first couple uses.i just don't know what to do here, I don't want to not go to this outing and be disrespectful but I have tried to reason with my girlfriend so much about this and she seems to be firm on taking her friends side and I seriously cannot see what is wrong with me staying in the room.

I(25, F) had my prom in 2017 and I bought my entire prom outfit for myself due to my family not having the best economy and I saved for over a year to be able to buy my dream dress and jewelry(everything in total about $300, which is a lot for us). I had an amazing time and that dress is very important to me since I have never had the best self confidence and it made me feel beautiful.Now my sister(18, F, lets call her Annie) is having her prom later this year and she asked if she could use my dress as well. She loves it and wished to use it. I told her that I would prefer if she didnt since it is so important to me(I also have a nero disorder and it makes it hard for me to let other people use my things) and she said okay and said she at least wanted to ask, but she was fine with finding another dress and I said Id help pay if she wanted (and if she wanted, she was welcome to use the jewellry, she will wear the hair accessories) I am pretty stable in income. Annie thanked me and said we could go shopping together.Now, I live about three hours away from my family due to school and I dont go home often due to not having a car. I came home last week to visit as my nephews(cousins kids, shes like a sister) are getting baptised. When I walk through the front door to my parents house, Annie is wearing my prom dress and my grandma and mom are taking messurments. I ask them what they are doing and they said that I'm being am AH for not letting Annie use it. She is my \"baby sister\" after all(moms words). I got upset and screamed at Annie to take it off, which I later apologised for, she believed I changed my mind since mom said I had agreed. I yelled at my mom and grandma because they tried to go behind my back and even change the dress to better fit Annie, she is 155lbs, I was almost 300lbs when I wore it. I cried and yelled at them. As soon as Annie came back with my dress, I took it and packed it down, saying I'd stay with my cousin.Now my family is torn. Some people agreeing with me and some saying Im an AH for not letting Annie use it. I dont feel like I was in the wrong for not letting her use it, after all it was all my dress that I payed for and I even offered to pay for her dress.So AITA?EDIT: Since a lot of people have mentioned not wearing it again. I have worn it since. It's not the typical \"prom dress\", its more a flowy summer dressAlso, the reason I didn't bring it with me is because I live in a dorm room and I could only bring the essentials with me. Once I move to a bigger place, I planned on bringing all my stuff to my new place. The dress is currently at my cousins place and I might bring it back with me when I go home.Please don't blame my sister for this. Her and I have talked it out and we're on good terms.

My BIL thought everything should go to him since he was closest with the uncle but the estate attorney disagreed and everything was split between the siblings of the uncle. We ended up buying a sports car from the estate for a little under marker value because no one else wanted it or had the means to purchase it. We only agreed after BIL asked us to buy it so it wouldn't be gone to some stranger. It's been several years and the car isn't really a good fit for our family since my husband now has a long commute to work and insurance costs in my area have doubled in 2 years. Did I mention the car takes premium gas and gets about 13 mpg? We bought a model 3 to make my husband's commute easier but now we have this other car taking up garage space and costing 200 a month for insurance and depreciating in value. When we asked BIL if he's going to buy it from us soon he said it would be 5 more years when he has his other car paid off. We told him we want to sell it because it's just not practical for us and now he's throwing a tantrum. He could sell his car and buy the car from us but he won't do that. He makes a good amount from his job but he's not responsible with money at all and recently. He just bought a $5000 golf cart a few weeks ago. We also said we'd sell it for what we paid for it since we didn't put many miles on it and we could sell for a lot more to a private party. Of course he wants a steep discount as well. I understand he's grieving for his uncle but his mom already bought the other sports car from the estate and is holding it for him at her house. We'd also be willing to sell to him for a good price and he's had over 2 years to save up or could take a loan. We could really use the cash from the car since cost of living has gone up for us significantly the last 2 years.TLDR: Are we in the wrong for wanting to sell our car and not hold it for my BIL?",

I've always been quietly afraid he'd fly too close to the sun.Well, my fears came true today. He stormed into the living room wearing- get this- a clown costume. Blue hair, red nose, jumpsuit, the whole nine yards. He looks ridiculous, to say the least. I ask him about it, and he tells me he was trying to be \"memorable\" at the singing competition audition he just came back from. He was storming around the place all angry because the judges told him he was too pitchy and sounded like he was bleating like a goat, just like I had been thinking for all these years. Still, he refused to believe the judges' feedback, insisting that he \"nailed it\" and that some people \"just aren't ready for me\".I take a few deep breaths to keep my cool, and point out that these judges actually work with singers, so shouldn't they know what they were talking about? My brother starts yelling at me about how I'm \"taking their side\" and \"unsympathetic\" (when I'm just trying to understand why he doesn't believe the judges), and about how accusing someone of singing like a goat is \"morally wrong\".So I break the news to him so that he doesn't keep chasing this pipe dream for the rest of his life: he's a bad singer. I brace myself for him to start crying or something, but instead he accuses me of being jealous of his dream (when I have never shown an interest in the performing arts), calls my dream of becoming a computer programmer stupid (when I, unlike him, have shown skill in that area) and accuses me of betraying him.So I let him perform his song in front of me to see for myself how he did.

I know I should be relieved. I even help him decide on a new career path (a computer programmer, which he called stupid just two minutes before).

About a year ago, my mom gave Arya an old cell phone of hers to play with. I didn’t like it, but I conceded and said “no internet.” I found out my mom had given Arya internet. I said I didn't like it. I told Arya she wasn’t allowed to have internet at home but she could still play on the phone. Arya connected the phone to the internet using the WiFi password I have in a frame in the guest bedroom - my mistake. Arya spent her time on the phone watching YouTube (not allowed activity). I explained it was warning one and she wasn’t allowed on it and to get off. I caught her a third time and I took away the phone indefinitely. My mom knew I wasn’t happy that she started this whole thing, but I let it go because Arya was the one who made the series of bad choices. Clearly a sign she wasn’t ready for a phone.I had radio silence from my mom for 24 hrs. I called her calmly and said that I would like to hear what happened from my mom's point of view. She got defensive. She explained what she told my daughter to do with the situation and said they had a talk with her about how it was wrong. Never once telling her to talk to me. I told her I understand why she didn’t give me a heads up but that I expected her to at least tell her to come to us and accept responsibility, not hide it and continue to lie about it. We went back and forth about it until finally my mom said “its just a f—king phone” and that’s when I lost my temper. I reminded her that I didnt want Arya to have the phone in the first place. I told her she's teaching Arya that it’s okay to lie to me and she doesn’t have to listen to me, “because you don’t either and that’s why I’m pissed” and I hung up. I’ve heard nothing from her since.Edit: removed the last paragraph as it doubled for some reason.",

And if Drew were king he would rule like Peter III.My husband gave me a funny look and said Why are you saying mean things about Drew.I explained that the character Peter III is just looking to have fun and party, and does not care much what happens to his country or its people. This is like Drew. He is fun, likes to party, but is a bit of a dick. He cheated on both his ex-wife and ex-girlfriend. Maybe his current one too. He does not care about bigger picture things like social or political or environmental issues. I know this stuff mostly from what my husband has told me.So my husband got upset. Said that this was a weird cruel thing to say. That the character Peter is the worst person on the show (not true but anyway) and how could I compare Drew to him. I tried to defend myself, but he cut me off, starting imitating me saying, I am Lindsay, I say weird cruel things that I think are funny. Well, you’re not funny Lindsay. You say weird cruel things.I thought he was messing with me, because the reason I mostly know this stuff about Drew is because he tells me. But he wasn’t. He was angry.This has really bothered me.

I have no idea what triggered her truly but she has kicked me out (her uncle owns the apartment) with two weeks notice and is holding most my bond for ridiculous reasons like not returning forks and spoons and a cleaning bill almost $400 despite my room being spotless when I had vacated the property.Some background information is that she likes to blame her bipolar on everything she does and acts like she doesn’t have to apologise for her actions. When we first moved in I was cooking almost every night for the two of us even tho I had 38hr weeks in a restaurant and she only worked 15hrs at a juice shop. I kept everything fairly clean the best I could even when my depression started to really take a toll on me. When the issues really started to arise I was barely able to feed myself or get out of bed in the morning for work and yet if I left a few dishes in the sink it was as if I was the devil himself to her. I ended up trying my best to get motivated and clean but it felt like nothing was good enough for her and my depression wasn’t an excuse I could use since she apparently also suffered from it and could still “stay motivated”.We managed to work past it and resolve the issue but because she obviously was telling her parents about the issues they came to dislike me. She left to see them for a while and came back very hostile towards me. I left one day for my mothers birthday and came back to an empty fridge. I left for a total of 2 days and the food she claimed was bad I had used the day I left. I confronted her about it and she lost it telling me that she’s sick of the smell of the apartment (I bought as many air fresheners as possible when she was originally having issues to help with that problem despite the apartment being relatively clean and I left almost no food mess). The next day she gave me a two weeks notice and now I’m fighting to get my bond of $880 back which she is refusing.In my frustration I went on my private Instagram account to complain through a post (she is blocked so I’m guessing someone close to her told her). Now she is claiming I’m cyber bullying her and I need to take down the post or she will report me for cyber bullying. I didn’t call her any names or anything I just mainly complained about the situation and how confusing it is and how I needed to understand her bipolar but she refused to understand my depression.AITA?",

She agreed that this way completely reasonable, and so did my best friend (let's call him Ben). On the day of, the competition lasts a bit longer than I thought it would and I am absolutely exhausted, so I text in the group-chat with Ben and our friend and say that I am too tired, but I hope they have a great time. The other friend that she invited cancelled as well, so at this point, it is just going to be Ben and the birthday girl (let's call her Amanda).Here's where things get a little bit complicated. I have had a crush on Ben for all of high school, and while he has always acted in a romantic way towards me (holding hands, cheek kisses, cuddling, hugs from behind, etc), he has denied having those same feelings towards me every single time I have brought it up. This has always frustrated me because of the mixed signals he constantly gives me, but I tried my best to be respectful of the fact that he doesn't want anything with me in that regard. For the past few months, however, he has been acting flirty towards Amanda. I have teased him about it a few times, but that is the extent of our conversations about her.After the hangout, I get a text from him saying, 'I actually fucking hate you.' My heart sinks in my chest, so I ask him what he means, and he accuses me of cancelling on the hangout to try and set him and Amanda up with each other. This was not the case, and I explained that to him, but the fact that he was so quick to be so nasty towards me over something so small really hurts my feelings. He says that he feels like he can't trust me anymore because of this.So, AITA? I don't think I'm out of line, but it seems that his feelings were really hurt by what I did.

At the time, me and my husband couldn’t support her at the dream school as we had crazy overhead costs. We did contribute what we can, but asked Annie to work part time.Even after the financial aid, Annie worked a job to go towards her rent and this has meant her studies suffered. She had to defer some of her classes to sit them in the summer. She has now since graduated and landed a good job.Ben wasn’t fussed about where he got into and he did well at high school, and got a full ride scholarship, so we didn’t pay for his tuition. Occasionally I sent him money to spend on himself.Cal is my youngest and as its been a few years since Annie went to college, me and my husband are in a better financial position to support where he wants to go. Cal got many offers and picked his first choice. He was eligible for some financial aid, but the majority will be out of pocket. As we didn’t contribute for Ben’s tuition, we are able to send Cal to a more prestigious school.When Cal announced this news at a family dinner, Annie got upset that Cal gets to go to his dream school and accused us of favourites.

After that, more things happened, which caused their friendship to get more awkward.One of our friends, Lily, decided to take things into her own hands. She asked Sally if she could send Bob a few messages. Sally said no, but Lily kept on insisting. I also told her not to do it. She did it anyway. The messages she sent him were like, \"You're a bitch\" and \"Stay away from Sally,\" This made Bob think that Sally was talking behind his back, so he cut off all contact with her. This made Sally even more upset. She got mad at Lily and blamed it all on her. After that, I told Lily to apologize to Sally, and she said she will.Then 2 weeks later, when Sally and I were ranting to each other, she told me about how Lily didn't apologize.

Last weekend I went to lunch with my mother and she was quite angry at something that happened during our wedding.During the reception my husband and I went away for a short while (like 40 minutes) to do a small fotoshoot with just the two of us. After that we went back to the reception to talk to everyone. Between reception and dinner we wanted to take some group portaits. However, we did not want to spend too much time on them, as we did not want to be away for long from the rest of our guests. So before the wedding we decided on 7 group compositions and shared these list with our photographer and MOH. She helped gather the people. The compositions were a bit like this:- me, husband, MIL, FIL, SIL, BIL- me, husband, father, grandfather- me, husband, grandparents, uncle and aunt (mothers side)- me, husband, mother, sister, sisters fiancé, brotherMy mother has been dating her new boyfriend (Eddy) 1 years and 4 months before our wedding day. We met him after 2 months of dating and have since seen him about 5-7 times. Each time there were around 12-14 people present and we were together for around 4 hours. These were also the only times I see my family, so I try to talk to everyone for a short time. Therefore, we have not spoken to him or gotten to know him very well and do not really have any connection with him yet. Therefore, we did not add him onto the list for the picture with my mom, sister etc. During the pictures, my mom came to ask me if it was correct that Eddy is not on the list. I said yes and continued with the next group.Last weekend was the first time I saw my mom one-on-one since the wedding. She told me Eddy and herself were very upset that he was not invited for the picture. I tried to explain that we did not want to spend to much time on the pictures, I did not know him very well and we did not form a connection yet. She said that they almost left the wedding because of this and they really thought we/I disliked Eddy. I told her I thought he was a very nice guy, from the short conversations we had. He was also seated second row during the ceremony, with his son, while my MOH was in third row (there were two rows of 4 seats next to on another, so quite tight), which I thought was a kind gesture. During the conversation, my mom and I did not get on the same page. I believe I did nothing wrong and the decision was up to me. She thinks we were in the wrong for excluding him.So, am I the asshole? I think I might be the asshole as I could have included 1 more compositon (so 8 total) to have one with Eddy and one without (my mom said this would have been better)",

	"title" : "AITA: Am I Being Unfairly Criticized for my Noise Levels in my Dorm Room?",
	"body" : "I live in a dorm room with no roommates, but am surrounded by neighbors on both sides. I tend to watch a fair amount of TV, which I've always tried to keep to a low volume level, as I'm naturally very conscious of those around me and try hard to place others' comfort before my own. In fact, my volume tends to be so low that I actually need subtitles to help me understand the words from across the room. Additionally, I have very good hearing, so I think my notion of acceptable noise levels is accurate.Well, a couple months back, my RA texted me about receiving a noise complaint in regards to a movie I was watching. I'll admit, this time the volume was SLIGHTLY higher than I usually have it, but I would still say it was far from blaring or even really being loud at all (just high enough that I didn’t need the subtitles). Regardless though, I felt so bad that I just turned my movie off in the middle of it to make certain I wouldn’t be a bother, and I've since made an even greater effort to keep my volume down—I think—extremely low.I'd assumed the girl who made the complaint was the one who lives in the room opposite the wall right where my TV is placed, as I'd have guessed—perhaps due to the thin walls of the dorm room—the volume might sound louder to her than it did to me sitting on the opposite side of the room.However, this morning, I received multiple knocks on my door at about 8:30 AM. To my surprise, it was my neighbor across the wall on the OPPOSITE side of the TV—further away even than my own location when watching TV. She was pretty sweet, but—in my opinion—harped too long on the fact that she “hears what I’m playing ALL THE TIME” and that it's very disruptive to her studying.I told her repeatedly that I was very sorry, and she was kind about it, but I've spent the day feeling somewhat frustrated by her complaint. I feel like I'm now unable to relax in my own room, as I can’t fathom how I could watch or listen to anything at any volume level that would be acceptable to her, and my ears don’t tolerate earbuds or headphones well, so it would be an added layer of annoyance for me to have to use them within the confines of my own walls.I was also told by a friend a while back that this neighbor has a bad hearing sensitivity, which could explain why she's able to hear these noises which I think are extremely minimal. I feel bad that I’m being a disruption even after all my effort not to be, but I feel she could’ve been a bit nicer about it, or at least recognized the fact that it's likely (or at least potentially) her fault—due to her hearing sensitivity—that she's having problems, and not mine. I've lived in this dorm for three years and have never received any other complaints, so I just would have appreciated some more grace and not so much blame for the situation.

I said no because the idea of eating someone else’s food grossed me out. He also got the large drink which was a dollar more but he could have opted for the smaller one and just gotten free refills. But he just didn’t want to get up.Anyways we left the sandwich shop and we began to walk and he reached into his pocket and grabbed his change, the coins and literally tossed them on the sidewalk. I was taken aback. I asked him why he did that and he said he doesn’t like change because it weighs his pants down and he hates carrying coins. I told him he can’t do that and he said of course he can he just did and always does.While at the bar I couldn’t let it go and told him he was insane. That if he tossed out $.50 cents everyday he was wasting well over a hundred dollars a year. He said he didn’t care and said if I am that desperate for money I can go pick it up. The rest of the night was awkward. He kept insisting on buying me beers even though I have money. He did it to rub it in my face. At the end of the night I flat out told him he was irresponsible and stupid and his arrogance was gross considering how many people struggle just to stay afloat.I told my girlfriend and she said I was harsh and confrontational for no reason. She said that the money can go to homeless people of whoever happened to find it so he’s not actually throwing it away.Idk Reddit was I the asshole?",

	"body" : "So i (15m) am going to pass from 10th to 11th grade this winter break. Every year at my highschool they do this big mexican celebration (im in mexico) to clebrate our tradition and shiz, and everyone is mandated to participate in it. They give each grade a little post to sell food and drinks, and they give us a bunch of tickets so we can sell them and fund the party.My (20f) sister went to the same school i am in and put herself as my tutor, wich means shes basically the one the school sends the emails and calls about tuition and stuff like that, so since shes alredy been to about 3 of this partys she knows the gist of it and was supposed to help me sell the tickets, aswell as my (50m) father who  is the one who pays for the tuition. When i told him said \"yeah ill help you sell em\". A month passes and its a week before the party, and i had still not sold any tickets, and i forgot about them cause of exams and they where just collecting dust in my drawer.Thats when my father tells me \"hey you wanna go to seaworld with me n your stepmom?\" Wich to i say \"sure\", but i was on the day of the party, wich i didnt really mind not going to cause its seaworld. After i return, the party is over and i never hear from the tickets again. A week after that, i get told by the principal i need to pay some late fees on tuition n extra stuff (wich i presume where the tickets), i tell my dad and he pays with some troubles from the sales department at the highschool, but it gets resolved.Mind this is in late september, jump to a week ago at the end of the winter break when my sister comes to me saying \"hey, i just got a call from school saying you need to pay for the tickets you had to sell, how many did you sell?\" And i told her \"none, i didnt go to the party, plus, you n dad didnt really help me sell shit\" to wich she gets mad at me for \"not being responsible\" and i tell her \"tf was i supposed to do???\" To wich she responded \"you couldve sold them to your friends\" wich i did try, none of them wanted to get in extra dept. she tells me that we have to pay for the tickets, and i ask her how much is it, SHE SAYS 30 BUCKS PER TICKET. I found the old strip of tickets amd counted 16, wich means at a total it would cost us about 400-500 dollars.now my sister and mom are mad at me for this, and i dont even know if my father knows yet, and i cant sell them now that the party was done 4 months ago, i honestly dont think im the ah in this situation, cause this is the first of this partys i was in and my sister was supposed to help me out, she did nothing, and my father was supposed to help me sell the dang tickets, he also did nothing, i did my part to the best of my knoledge and they did not help at all, now my family is mad at me....so reddit. AITA?Update: i tough i might need to clear up somethings about my situation, so heres a quick notes:i really dont want to just place the blame somewhere else, i believe in consequences for actions, i also see how i have may come across as irresponsible, wich i kinda are, i have no real expirience with this stuffI really couldnt just \"take responsibility\" of selling the tickets, people at school didnt want more tickets, i dont know anyone outside school, and i couldnt sell them around cause i aint allowed to wander around in the streets, also i couldnt sell them online, thats why i needed the help from my family.When i say \"oh i forgot\" i mean that i was in the middle of exam season and had to study for ablut 12 differen exams and projects wich took all my attention at the momentUpdate 2: aight i think to clear up MORE things4. some people seem to think i just got the tickets and didnt even mention them to my parents, and now blame them, and sorry if i told it like that, english aint my first language and its my first time writing a aita story. I did tell my family about my tickets, for about 2 weeks straight, we got the tickets at the start of the semester, i talk to my family about it, then at the end lf the semester i entered exams and thats when i left the tickets in a drawer. i asked them about 7 times in 2-3 weeks before the exams came5. The tickets arent a house to house sale, they literally just give you a bunch of tickets n say \"sell em\"Update 3 and final: well i read alot of your comments and responded to a few, and the situation just got resolvedYES im a ass for not remembering my responsibility YES the school is a ass for giving students over 400 dollars worth of stuff YES my fam couldve help me more At the end of the day im mostly at fault, and i accept itI just talked to my father about the matter and he told me to not worry too much about it, he will pay the fee, and even apologized for not helping me sell the tickets, i also apologized for getting him into this mess, as for my sister i think shes still mad at me, but i think itll blow offThanks for the kinda reality check and for the supportAlso if any tiktokers see this: DO NOT POST THIS STORY, I DONT MEAN THIS AS CLOUT CHASING AT ALL, I TRULY FEAR THIS GETTING BACK TO MY KNOWN ONES OR EVEN THE SCHOOLThanks for reading ",

	"body" : "I (28f) had met Hana (27?f) a while back on my daily commute to work via public transit.The first day of talking to her, she explained that she was trying to make new friends, since she was new to the area. I could tell she was trying to talk to anybody that would give her eye contact.Overhearing her, and sitting in a spot where avoiding eye contact was hard, she fixated on me. I'd thought to myself that I wasn't looking for a commute buddy or really any new friends, but talking to her wasn't so bad as she was pretty easy to talk to.She would talk a lot about herself, explaining her relationship dynamics with her boyfriend, her family; dog troubles, work life and how hard she has it. To me, I never got the impression that she wanted my help specifically, but only to have someone to vent to from time to time. Which I was fine with.As time passed, she would explain in more detail about her life. She told me about how abusive her boyfriend is, how manipulative her job is, how toxic her family was; the fact that she's barely scraping by, how she struggles to find a place to live due to bad credit and not having a support system... the list goes on. The bad would outweigh the good by a mile each time. I would try my best to give her advice, and help her think through situations and come up with solutions. This was every time I saw her.All of her woes made my heart break for her, time and time again. Whenever we would see each other, she would update me on the next unlucky thing that would happen to her. And like clockwork, I would give advice. Eventually her texting grew to be a daily thing. This was getting too much for me- sometimes it was 2-3 times a day, even when I didn't respond. And when I did, she would come back with novels explaining her woes to which I would feel obligated to give advice for.She started calling me her best friend and that I was something special to her. This felt like she was desperately clinging to anyone that would give her attention, even if it were just from time to time. We didn't hang out outside of the commute (which was about 30 minutes) And we went out to ONE lunch in person.Around when her texts got frequent, my family and I were going through a rough time with a dying loved one and my job was becoming more demanding. Her daily texts were causing anxiety that I didn't need.After mulling it over with my partner and debating with myself, I sent her the text asking to stop texting me daily, and explaining my feelings towards our relationship. After that, she didn't respond. In fact, I found out that she blocked me on everything.So now I feel shitty for asking at all, and I've lost her as a friend completely.AITA for asking my clingy friend directly to stop texting me so much, and my feelings on how I cannot be her BEST friend? Should I reach out to her and apologize?Edit: the message I sent to her verbatim I posted in the comments.",

One of them being my big sister (26 female). My sister we will call her M came to visit a few years ago because she lives in another state. Leaving behind her boyfriend whom she lived with.  She stayed with me and she also stayed with her aunt where her cousin (male) was living. We will call him N. So I had a weird feeling when she was staying with me and my now ex. I felt like she would flirt with him. He did not flirt back but it still made me uncomfortable. Well when she went to stay with N she would tell me how hot he was and how she wanted to F*** him. When I dropped her off N was telling me how gorgeous I was and would love to take me out. Of course I rejected bc I was in a relationship. Well the next day she called me to tell me how they had F***** and proceeded to give me details. Then told me the next day they had done it again. Fast forward to now. She now has a new boyfriend and he found out about her and N and for some reason got mad even though he wasn’t in the picture at the time (I don’t think). He threatened to break it off if she didn’t tell him the truth if they slept together and now she is saying that N rapped her. So M’s new boyfriend told her dad and her dad made her press charges. So she is. She told me to stand by her side and testify that N rapped her. And I just don’t believe it. When I ask her why she lied to me and gave me all those details and was so happy. She said that N threatened to kill her. I also now N well and he’s not that type of guy to threaten to kill someone. M said that N was very drunk and don’t remember having sex but I talked to him and he gave me very similar details that she did back then. So it is just hard for me to believe she’s telling the truth. Especially being a rapped victim myself…I testified on N’s behalf and now she has blocked me on everything and wants nothing to do with me for not supporting her.",

She was taller and thicker than me so her shirts were a little too long and wide (specifically the sleeve length and width of the shirt). I was thinking of donating to Goodwill or a charity bc they were long-sleeve and newer. A week or 2 after I get the shirts, my sister asks to borrow a long-sleeve due to the cold season. I told her that they were on a chair in my bedroom. They were folded. The shirt fit her perfectly except for the sleeve length. (she is curvier than me. I’m a petite.) She took the shirt. Later that day, I walk into my room and notice that ALL of the shirts were unfolded. It seemed that she took one out of the middle (they were in a stack), disrupting the rest in the process. I called her and told her that she needs to fold these back. I personally think that is common courtesy. She says she won’t. I tell her, “Take all the shirts then, they don’t fit me anyway.” She said she only wanted that one shirt. I tell her to come fold the clothes then. She instead cries to our mother.(I won’t say my sister’s exact age but just know that she is at least the age of a middle schooler.)

My brother was with them that night. He is a person who is hardly affected by these things but he still tried to stop all of it from happening. During Covid my mom was hospitalised so I moved back home after 4 years. My brother was 16 at that time. Series of events starts from here. She was back home a month later I got a pitbull pup. Me my mom and my brother loved him like crazy 6 months later her friends told her that pit bulls are crazy breed and we should get rid of him. My dog was trained on 108 commands by the time he was 6 months old. However he was never fully trained for pooping and peeing outside. He was getting better at it though. My mom thought I wasn’t taking care of him in a good way and her friend’s influence made her give the dog to one those friends who took him to US overnight. I got pissed and moved out of the house the very same day, my brother decided to do the same and came along with me. I was staying by myself for 2 years when I thought my dad’s health is deteriorating and he has been drinking regularly. I got a bigger place and asked him to move with me which triggered my mom.

My boyfriend has two sons from his previous marriage, the youngest (13M) and the oldest (22M). For context, their mother died about 8 years ago. This has caused them to not be accepting towards me, which I completely understand. However, I have tried my absolute best to bond with them and get them to like me. They continue to be disrespectful towards me and exclude me when it comes to spending time with their father. I have brought this up to my boyfriend but he does not say anything and becomes distant.We are currently getting situated with the baby and are planning room options. Naturally, my mind wandered to moving the youngest into the oldest’s room and the baby into the youngest’s room. The thing is, We have the space for the oldest to live here (in the basement) but I don’t want him to. He is very narcissistic and selfish. He does not pay rent despite making more money than my boyfriend and I combined. (He has showed me and his father his bank account on several occasions.) He does not contribute in any way, shape, or form. He does not pay rent and if anything, brings his girlfriend (17F) over every other weekend to spend the night. Which I have expressed my disapproval for. I try to talk it out with my boyfriend but again, he becomes cold and shuts me out.Finally the other day, I sat down with my boyfriend and told him that I thought it was time for the oldest to move out. I told him that with the baby we are expecting, it would be best. He got very upset and defensive with me and told me that he knew I never liked him. I told him that it wasn’t that I didn’t like him but I had a problem with how he treats me, my boyfriend, and my boundaries. He has no care for anyone who isn’t himself. My boyfriend began saying he couldn’t abandon him and that he needed to keep him close due to their mother. I told him that the oldest has talked countless times about moving out and buying a house in another state with his girlfriend, how would he feel about that? He said that was different because he was doing it out of his own freewill. My stepson has caught wind of this and has continued to overstep my boundaries purposely because of this. He is loud in the morning, he did laundry all day yesterday and we ran out of laundry detergent. (He knows I buy it.) The youngest seems to also be acting out in defense of his brother. My boyfriend has not spoken to me at all and makes an effort to keep his distance away from me. I am honestly tired and pregnant.

I told him that I am very much straight to which he claimed that ‘Dove’ must be to make fun of Dean being gay and I must be homophobic. I told him he was being absurd and asked why I would be here if I was homophobic.Dean then came back to the table and Jay claimed that they should be heading out to get back before the roads got icier. We paid and said goodbye and I was honestly too shell shocked to say anything about it.

After seeing this I asked her why she did it and she really didn't have a clear answer except that I \"touched one of her things that one time\" and blah blah blah. I really emphasized that she cannot touch my things and she just rolled her eyes at me. At this point my shit had been touched, my boundaries crossed, and disrespect was given and it really didn't seem like she cared at all or was even sorry. So when she came to me the next day to ask her to re-pay her for a coffee we had gotten (literally 3 euros), I told her no and that it was a fine for touching my things and going through my personal belongings. Anyways she called me \"crazy\" and then proceeded to give away our shared weed to a friend as a gift from only her, and locked me out of one of my socials( it has since been recovered). She has since moved out and has been cut out of my life.AITA for doing this to her?",

	"body" : "I (27M) live in a house with two roommates (23M) and (22M).  We work different jobs, but on Mondays we all get to work from home.This past Monday, I made the horrible discovery that I was out of groceries.  I tried to survive the day on two granola bars, but when 3:00pm hit I was absolutely starving.  I'm definitely not supposed to run personal errands during work hours, so perhaps I'm the asshole here by default.  But I was dying of hunger and it was eating into my productivity, so I decided that I'd take a trip to the local burrito shop.Before leaving I went to my roommates and said \"Hey, I know you're on the clock and can't go with me.  But I'm running to the burrito shop.  If you want anything and place an order right now, I can pick it up for you with my food.\"  Both roommates thanked me for my offer but said they were all set.I hopped in my car and drove 10 minutes to the burrito shop.  Right as I picked up my food and walked out the door, I received a text from one of my roommates.  \"Hey I just placed an order, says it'll be ready in 15.  Can you grab it for me?  Thanks!\"  I was already bending the rules of my employer by being out ordering food during work hours.  My goal was to get food and get home as quickly as possible, minimizing the time I was away from my desk.  Now suddenly my roommate wanted me to waste 15 more minutes?I texted him back saying no, explaining how I was still on the clock.  When I arrived home he was FUMING.  He mentioned how I offered to pick up his food, made him spend $10 on a burrito, and then left it there to go to waste.  The burrito shop was only 10 minutes away from us, but he couldn't leave his desk for work, so it just went to waste in the restaurant.From my perspective though, the original offer was to pick up his food if he \"placed an order right now\", aka prior to my departure.  He said no, later changed his mind, and then decided on his own that I'd waste an extra 15 minutes of my day waiting for his food.  AITA?",

	"body" : "Yesterday, I (25M) came home and wanted to take a shower. We can only do that once every two days, to save money. I can wash myself at the sink in the bathroom at all times though. However, yesterday I asked for an exception since I had done physical activity that day and I preferred to shower. She (55F) didn't seem too happy about it, but she allowed it and told me to take a quick shower. I did what we always do when we shower: I turned on the heating, took a quick shower.She got angry when she found out I had turned on the heating. She told me a quick shower didn't require that, waste of energy. I told her I'd leave it off next time I'd take a short shower. She stayed angry and kept complaining about the heating. She called it absurd behavior, excessive use of the heat, and that an adult like me should know better. This went on for a while, to the point that she was still talking to herself about it while I was trying to sleep. She does this more often where she rants about me to herself out loud when I'm in another room.I sat down with her to express how it made me feel. I started out by acknowledging that she didn't like that I showered for two days in a row. I also told her I understand that turning on the heat wasn't a good idea. I then said that it's not fair to express her frustration for so long after. I asked her to share her expectations with me, or express her anger or frustration once in the moment so I'm aware what I'm doing wrong in her eyes and can change my behavior. This didn't click with her, and she went into the same rant as yesterday.I kept trying to push my point until she understood my feelings. The ranting just continued. She also added new things. My towel was ''too wet'' (she asked me to place it under the shower since it leaks sometimes) and she also said I shouldn't turn up the shower heat (I didn't turn up the shower heat). I kept trying to explain to her that she doesn't communicate her expectations clearly, and that she always blames me after the fact and then rants about it for too long. I wanted her to acknowledge this and at least apologize for that.Things got heated, and she got to the verge of tears. Even to the point where she grabbed my shoulders, looked me in the eyes, and told me I shouldn't take it personal and that she loves me. She still never acknowledged or apologized for her behavior. This made me very confused. It made me feel loved, but it completely missed the point. I feel like she just doesn't really understand how to communicate boundaries or expectations. The mixed feelings make me doubt if she means well and that I might just be an asshole for demanding an apology where I should just let things go. AITA?",

What happened was my friend came to visit me from another country, i usually have people visit me about 1-2 times a year but they never stay longer than 2 weeks and we usually like to sit outside on the balcony at night to talk and look at the stars.My house is a twin house which I share with lovely neighbours and we always had a very good relationship, they have 2 kids that still go to school.So what happened last night was my neighbours asked me and my friend at around 1am to be a little quiter, i apologized right away because we totally forgot the time and were just lost in our conversation, she kept saying how loud we were and i apologized about 5 times and even thanked her for telling me so we can keep it down.Her tone was a little rude but i just let it slide because it was 1am and she might have had a bad day, you never know.Anyways when i went to send my friend to the airport today, my neighbour called out my 80year old dad (who is already chipping at my mental health because I am the only one who can take care of him and he is just very very difficult) and told him about it and she even recorded how loud I was with my friend. She proceeded to tell him how we were loud for DAYS and her kids were sleep deprived and couldnt go to school because of us and this made me SO MAD because WHY didnt she tell me since day 1?! And why couldnt she wait to tell ME?She didnt say anything until last night and turned it into such a big deal when it really wasnt and the problem was already solved when she told me the first time to be quiet, since we did keep very quiet afterwards. -(or so i thought).Anyways when I got home I got a lot of negativity from my dad, saying how i cant respect other people, or dont understand them, or how i should act accordingly. But how should I know when the neighbours wont say anything?So since I am obviously the asshole according to my dad and my neighbours, am I actually the asshole?UPDATE: Talked with my neighbours, turned out they never had a problem with me and my friends talking on the balcony (even if we were a little louder) because they always had their AC, this month their AC broke for about a week now so they left their windows open.They apologized for being rude and we came to the conclusion next time i have friends over I will let them know before hand, and if we are too loud (or they decide not to open their AC when my friends are over) they should say something before it gets out of hand.",

	"title" : "AITA for allowing my boyfriend to sing Karaoke?",
	"body" : "I 25(F) love Karaoke nights with my friends. We have a bar that does it every Saturday and we are almost always there. My boyfriend doesn't join and usually goes and does something else. He has a good voice, but he is very self conscious about it. Apparently, in high school he was singing during youth group one day and a girl leaned over to him and said, \"If you aren't going to try to sing then don't sing at all.\" He says since then he doesn't like letting most people hear him sing as he feels he doesn't have a good voice.I've tried convincing him to come with us for months now and that his singing voice is good and that what that girl said was cruel but he has to try to move on. I promised he didn't have to sing and he could instead just watch and enjoy our company. Saturday he agreed to come.We were all taking turns and singing and having fun. Friends would ask him what he was going to sing and he kept saying that \"Karaoke isn't his thing.\" As the night went on and drinks were flowing I guess people kept asking him to try and he was starting to consider it. He gave me a look like he wanted my opinion on it and I said, \"I won't make you sing but it may good for you to try.\" The whole group agreed so he went and selected his song.I don't know if it was the nerves, song, or the alcohol but he admittedly wasn't very good. Was off key even for Karaoke and he wasn't great with the timing. He's usually better. However, when it ended I still gave him a big cheer and my friends cheered too. The rest of the place was pretty silent minus a few claps here and there. He sits down and is friendly with everyone for a minute then he tells me he wants to go home. I asked if we could stay just a bit longer. He said that I could and went and ordered an Uber for himself. He left telling everyone he was feeling tired.When I got home he went ballistic on me saying that I pressured him to sing and that it was extremely embarrassing for him seeing my friends pity clap him and the rest of the place just silent and awkward. I don't believe I pressured him but he said that not shutting down my friends requesting him to sing was endorsing it, which I understand but feel my friends weren't that insistent and that he was good. We cheered him afterwards and we gave a bunch of compliments. I can't control how he is feeling about others and while they maybe shouldn't have kept asking, he is fully capable of refusing their requests. He slept on the couch that night and the past few days hasn't wanted to hang out or really talk.I feel he's overreacting and making a bigger deal than it needs to be. My friends agree that he shouldn't be acting like this. They feel if he is this self conscious about this then he should take singing lessons instead of taking his insecurities out on me who was only trying to help and share a hobby of mine.  Maybe I should have said something or just shouldn't have invited him to Karaoke? AITA?",

My rental home was too far away from my ex's workplace so we found a new rental house. In my country, normally, the renter does the painting or wallpaper themselves as well as laying laminate( or other flooring) themselves. Luckily we both have family that wanted to help and I planned to move in about a month later.My ex her dad has a talent for that, which was wonderful but he only came one day every week. He works a fiscal job so it's reasonable but we were also not allowed to do work ourselves or only work with my family I didn't want to piss off my father in law so I left it at that accepting that I would pay double rent for an extra month or so( my ex didn't chip in for the new house) my family was also not that welcome to come to help if he was working on the house, a lot of grumbling under his breath. He also didn't take my talks about wanting to move in soon, double rent, etc not seriously and just did projects that would be just fine to do later, such as doing the garden, working in the shed, working in the attic, etc. don't get me wrong I am very grateful for all his work.After two and a half months of this very infuriating process, I gave my two weeks' notice to my old landlord and told my father-in-law I would move in soon and I would move into weeks and my father, stepfather, and uncle would be into laying the laminate that week, that was not a fun talk.That weekend when my dads and uncles were working on the floor we all had lunch together. my father-in-law had his fist under his underarms so his muscles looked bigger. I have never seen anybody do this(also never him before this) and he just kept talking and talking about himself and how he just does not do things that would be embarrassed about. So I said, \"Pumping up your muscles to make them look bigger would be something to be embarrassed about\". This I an asshole thing to say and I said it out of close to three months of frustration.Now to my question. Skipping to last month, (my ex split up 5 years ago after I found out my ex was sleeping around. ) I got an email from my ex telling me I have to say sorry for making him feel less than a man. My ex-father-in-law has developed depression and my words were the biggest reason for it.People around me are split up about how big of an asshole I am so what do you think?",

Moreover she is a light sleeper and our walls are thin.To be honest I come from a loud family and she comes from a quiet one and I recognize that I can get over excited and lose track of my volume sometimes. That being said, since she first complained I’ve tried to mind how loud I’m being after she goes to sleep. I speak below my normal volume, not a whispering but I try to be as quiet as possible while still being heard through a mic. She also wears noise canceling headphones when she sleeps but nothing seems to be helping.I’ve never had this problem before with my previous roommates and I know I was louder with them. I can’t tell if it’s really my fault and I don’t know what else to do but to just stop talking all together at night, but I don’t want to give up my hobby.Regardless I might be the asshole for being loud and keeping her up.

	"body" : "For the past three years, my brother (25 M) and I (22 M) have exchanged Christmas/B-day gifts. We live in Canada and with the housing crisis, moving out isn't really an option. This year, he surprised me with a drone. I Spent $100 on a white Nike cap, brown Raptors Toque, Hat Organizer, and Leafs lanyard. He's always stressed about misplacing his hats and wants more that are my style.I was shocked when I opened the drone gift. I was also worried it was expensive, so I asked how much he spent. He reassured me that he spent a similar amount.However, I couldn't shake off the disappointment and anxiety, as I felt the drone wasn't something I'd use. I belive, he gets me things, he wants for himself. My brother admitted in front of me, my mom, and his girlfriend - that the gifts he buys me - are also something he can wear and use.I acted happy and grateful but my girlfriend sensed my discomfort, knowing this is something my brother would love and that I’ve never shown any interest in.Some Examples (you could skip this):He gave me bright Red 550 New Balances. He already has the exact same for himself in blue “he liked both so much and couldn’t pick so he got the red ones for me” - I later asked for a receipt to make an exchange, no receipt and he has worn them.One b-day he gave me Purple Vans with a “One Piece” design (this is his favourite anime). I enjoy the show but I've NEVER worn anything like this (I have a very minimalistic style, I can provide a link to the shoes). This 100% was something he wanted for himself (no receipt provided). At the time, I felt really bad bc I knew I wouldn't wear the shoes and he would notice. I thanked him for the gift. Later I told him how I felt and asked him to keep the vans (he was very happy and wears them everyday), while I kept my gift to him - a custom “One Piece” poster of his favourite character (he wanted posters for his room this year).For the past 3 years it's just been more of the same. I feel he doesn't put in effort, I ask for a receipt, and my family calls me ungrateful. While my gifts are always so personal to him.My girlfriends noticed this trend and how increasingly rude he's been with me over the years. I don't feel close with him - like she does with her younger brother (4 years apart, we're 3). My gf asked me to make this post bc I've been extremely conflictedMy parents call me ungrateful. Sometimes I think my brother gets me stuff he likes, thinking I'd like it too. However, it's difficult to communicate with my brother. He reacts angrily to simple requests for advice. He says he's a responsible older brother but I don’t even feel close with him. I can give more examples of other shitty things he doesSo, am I being the asshole by always asking for a receipt? And would I be the asshole again, if I ask to return the drone? I know that it will cause an argument/greater rift between us, and how my parents would react.Edit; Thought I'd provide more context about our relationsihp and why I feel so conflicted.I want a better relationship with my brother. Recently, when I think about how he treats me, I get depressed. When I compare our relationship to my gf and her brother (or other brothers), it's night and day. I'm not sure if what I'm thinking is right becuase my family always made me feel guilty.But I've been thinking he genuially treats me like shit. Recently, he wore my suede timberland boots (that I keep in prestien condition) and put a years worth of damage on them in 1 night. This is because I wore his hat. Salt was everywhere, deep scuffs, and creases. He didn't even bother cleaning them with our salt wipes. When we reff hockey together - he yells at me/trys to embarass me in front of our boses and strangers (this only happens w/ him - reffs are supposed to have each others back). I've also I told him nuermous times to stop. Our parents have overheard our arguments and are quick to tell me he doesn't know what he's doing, or just try to get us to stop.When I try telling him how he makes me feel, he literally could not care any less. He completely dismisses/ignores me. been like this since covid. he's also so quick to anger and ingores me to my face when I try talking to him. He acts like he can't hear me (as I stand right in front of him) and continues on his phone.For so long my family always tells me how I'm not responsible, consistently giving me shit. Rarley anything is said to him and they display him as a role model. I feel like this is a breaking point for me, but I honselty think I'm being a pos for feeling upset about his gits.",

He said it’s still a sick day, just drive her. Thoughts?*Edit: thanks everyone for the overwhelmingly NTA judgement. I ended up chugging NyQuil in front of him and passing out for a few hours, and he took that as a message to take her to school. To clear up a repeated question, I got sick from my daughter, who got sick from daycare and is now fully recovered, which is why she’s back at school. NY daycare is too expensive to keep her home for the entire duration of a daycare flu wreaking havoc through my household lol",

	"body" : "Hubby and I have been married 5 years. We have a 4yr old and 2yr old.He used to work full time and crazy hours especially during tax season, but was miserable so we decided he should use GI Bill to take classes full-time to get a bachelor's degree and then get a different job. He takes classes online and watches the kids while I'm at workI work M-F and am gone 8:30-12:30. The rest of the time I'm just on call. We live off my income but he does get money from the GI Bill and has partial disability from the army, so he does contribute financially. But there is no way we'd survive even a month without me working.We split the house responsiblies pretty evenly and he's really good about most of it. We have one area of contention - the laundry.I am happy to fold, hang, and put away all laundry. But I want it all done on Monday so I don't have to deal with it the rest of the week. So all I ask is all laundry be washed and in baskets by the time I get home on Monday at 12:30. I know this is possible to do, because when he was working full time, I did it everyday Saturday morning. Started laundry around 8am, and had everything washed before noon.But for some reason my husband cannot get it done on time. He loses track of time and never rotates anything, so when I get home it is a miracle if two of the four small loads are ready for me to fold/sort/hang. He has even started laundry on Sunday nights to try to get it done on time.....still no change. (Twice he actually HAS accomplished this, so yes it IS possible when he makes the effort to pay attention to timing.) But every Monday I end up upset because now I will have to do a load of laundry each day to keep up with everything. I'm so sick of it and I hate being mad at him for it.So, yesterday, when it happened again for the hundredth time, I told him from now on, I will keep my clothes separate, and he will be responsible for washing, folding, and putting away all other laundry, including our kids'. This way he can do it at his own pace and I don't have to worry about it and I'm no longer dependent on him doing his part.He's upset, saying I don't appreciate how hard he tries, and I only focus on the bad things etc. But the truth is I'm just tired of being disappointed and upset. I don't want to be angry every single Monday afternoon. So this is my solutionSo...AITA?Edited to add- I don't care HOW he does it or when. All loads are already sorted out. He could do a load every other day all week and then I just put them all away on Monday. IDGAF how it gets done. But if he wants ME to fold/sort/put away all the laundry, I just ask it be ready on Monday afternoon because it's the only free afternoon I have all week. Otherwise I have to shuffle other things around or stay up late after kids are on bed to do it.",

But recently I have been really stressing about the amount of room we have for a second child coming and I suggested to her that I will get a second job on my 2 days off and still reserve Sundays for family day, so I can take that money and put it into our savings so we can move before the baby comes, it sparked an argument with her saying “ I don’t want you to burn yourself out, and when are you going to clean, this is very hard on me with the baby and me being pregnant” so I understand where she is coming from, but we need to start planning for the future more than we have been.We came up with these goals together when we found out we were having another child, she then went and talked to her mom about it and her mom says we should stay where we are at because I quote “they won’t remember it anyways” but as a father I will remember that I feel and felt like a failure because I am not able to provide the right life for my children.

I started reading music my sophomore year and started off on bells (glockenspiel). My second year I was promoted to center marimba after auditioning for the spot. I've had that spot since then.When getting my music for this competition season I've accumulated 9 1/2 pages of sheet music. I have the most music out of the entire ensemble, including wind players. Also to add, I started playing 4 mallets my junior year with a small feature of permiantations. Compared to last year I have 3 times the amount of 4 mallet playing. Around 60% of my sheet music requires me to play 4 mallets.Our ensemble includes a section of marching winds, percussion section, and mallet section. Our old mallet/percussion tech left us last year and we now have a new percussion tech. He specializes in drumset and drum related activities (bass, snare, tenors etc.). He can't really read treble clef let alone teach 4 mallets. That's left the mallet line with a strong disadvantage when learning music. We don't have someone to guide us, and my director has left it to me to be responsible for the slack of keeping up with the rest of the ensemble.During rehearsals we are split into \"sectionals\" except that my section doesn't have a director. One mallet player has a learning disability that really sets him behind when learning music, and he is overall around 4-5 years younger than me. I'm not a teacher, I'm a student just like the rest of the mallet line/band.Whenever I try to help said student, they just sit there and watch me try to help them. They never actually try to play the music and \"give up\" but they refuse to quit the ensemble. My efforts to help have frustrated me greatly, I dont understand his disability nor was I notified of it (i figured it out myself).I was also never appointed the position of section leader or any other type of leading psoition.

They did have the stipulation that I had to completely pay for a semester of college, including tuition, room, and board, which I completely understood because I knew it would teach me more about the value of education and money and I wanted to chip in to help cover my tuition.I have worked extremely hard to earn scholarships based on my leadership and academic achievements. I am an engineer involved in several leadership roles in several extracurricular organizations. This semester, which is my last semester, I am only taking 6 hours, so I am not a full-time student. Tuition costs thousands less for part-time students than it does for full-time students, and as a result, $700 worth of my scholarships got rebated to my bank account. My parents and I were previously not aware I would get this money back, and that tuition would be less as a part-time student, and so my parents already had thousands set aside for my tuition that they now get to spend elsewhere.My dad has access to my bank account and noticed I had a large amount added to it this morning. However, my parents have since demanded that I give them this money to “go back into the pot” to help pay for my siblings’ educations. I feel as though I have worked hard to earn this money, as scholarships aren’t free— you have to put in the work to get them, and I have put forward a lot of work in rounding myself out and applying for these scholarships. I am about to start out my next chapter of life and my parents are cutting me off as soon as I graduate in May. Having this extra money can help pay for phone bills, insurance, and other costs I will incur when I start becoming completely financially independent. I am also living with my parents post-grad for 6 months and they are charging me for utilities and groceries. I offered to put the rebated money towards that, but that was shut down.They then brought up my upcoming wedding in January 2025, and threatened to cut back how much money they have agreed to give my fiancé and I for that wedding by at least $5k if I do not give them this $700 because I need to make sacrifices, as they are doing right now to save money.In the midst of this, I have been told I am selfish and do not think outside of myself for wanting this money and that I am clearly not mature enough for this next phase of my life. I do not think it is right for my parents to make it seem as if I owe them this money, even though they have helped me greatly throughout my life.

So I immediately understood and accepted the fact that we couldn't realise our dream too soon, also because she started to count every single penny she spent. Indeed, I've once asked her if she wanted to go and visit a city, since there was a very cheap train ticket (about 6€ back and forth) and she refused, saying that she couldn't afford that and that she didn't like the idea of visiting that specific place because it was cold.In the meanwhile, she found herself a boyfriend, and since then she nearly abandoned me. The few time she had, she spent it all with him. She never had time for me, except for the two hang outs we had this month. Funnily enough, while I was texting with her, I've discovered that she actually had enough time to go on several trips with her partner, even in that famous city that she refused to go with me, and that she didn't have her famous \"money problem\", since the two always split the bills and checks.I felt totally betrayed, and wrote her a message about her behaviour and how it made me feel. She answered me that she was sorry, and that she would try not to abandon me. Just the fact that she used the verb \"try\" made me realise that things won't probably change. The fact that she really preferred the company of her bf (they've know each other for 4 months) instead of mine, led me to reconsider our friendship. Indeed, it's been weeks since she apologised me, and I've already tried 5 times to hang out with her, but she always declined.I am really considering to leave her...

Single lift, single line to get out.A friend and I take the run, get down to the bottom, and there is a good 20+ minute lift line extending up onto the run. Booooooo. But what are you gonna do? It’s a “the line is so long, may as well take off my snowboard completely” kind of line. The line was so long that people were throwing snowballs at every chair that wasn’t full.This lift ALSO has Hike Back terrain, that is CLEARLY not open, under the lift You can basically ski past the lift, and then hike back to the lift, but there are no lifts lower, it’s all hike back. And it is more then obvious that none of that terrain is open (it’s some of the last terrain they get open, it won’t be open for a while).I watch a guy and his 2 kids ski down past the line, to where the rope is up for the hike back terrain. Which is down towards the front of the line. Then I watch him proceed to side step up to the line and try to slide in. I told my friends “excuse me, I’ll be right back”.I walked over and asked him, relatively nicely, if he had noticed the giant line that we were all standing in.

There is some back and forth that ends with him telling me “just be cool man, Ive got my kids with me” at which time I told him “Then set a better fucking example for your kids and walk your stupid fucking ass back to the top of the fucking line NOW you fucking asshole”.The kids appear to be like 10/12 ish. They heard everything we said for sure, the rest of the line really did not (I asked if they had heard me when I got back in line).Dude picked up his shit and went to the back of the line, because I physically stood in front of him and prevented any forward progress/blocked him from integrating into the line.",

But to be honest, growing up they made so much trouble for the three of us that I never wanted to be an issue for my parents.My mom had breast cancer and they NEVER not even ONCE went with her to quemo or doctors appointments. Six months later, my dad got discoverd lunge cancer and again, they weren't involved in the process. Just worried about who has going to be in charge. Thanks God and the good medicine they were both ok and in remision.Back to the story...We have a family business we were all involved (parents, brothers and SIL) until the moment my brother started a fight 2 Xmas ago for a mistake he thought I MADE but the truth was my dad DID (he is the boss tho). The fight escalated quickly and the next day was xmas eve, they didn't attened dinner and my brother just showed up throwing a big bag of presents and left. This was so unrespectful for my dad (btw he was still on quemo). The next monday my dad spoke to him about what he did and the talk got heated. He and his wife left the business deeply angry.I'm administrative manager so at night I texted them asking them to please come by the next day to make everything legally right if they were resigning. We were willing to pay them what they deserve even though it wasn't needed according to law (MEX) because it was a job abandonment. They argue they didn't trust us so I suggested to see en court so everybody was safe and after threaten me a few times he agreed. Things didn't go well so they both put a lawsuit against the business that hasn't come to a solution (again MEX). We haven't talked in little more than 2 years, until my mom sent my nephew a present and started texting with my brother.He now demands certain amount of money to put all behind, but my mom is pushing me to talk to a new lawyer and solve things once and for all. Why am I the one who has to solve this if I didn't make it? Always cleaning up after them... I want to refuse but she is my mom and always want to help her. But still, why they don't do something to clean their own shit up?",

She replied with “it’s not a debate, she is going to eat dinner. I’m not letting her starve.” I then knocked on the door again to which my sister opened her door, screamed in my face, and looked at me with the eyes of a deer in front of headlights. She collapsed to the floor and began to say over and over again “I can’t do it, I can’t do it, I can’t do it” it was obvious she was faking it.

Yes, you’re probably thinking I’m sick for leaving my sister in the hallway alone while she’s having a “panic attack” but by the way, she has had this behavior since the 1st grade.

I’ve lost count of how many times I go to look for something of mine only for her to say she lent it to somebody. She also takes forever to get the item back, she once lent my stuff  to a coworker and refused to ask for it back for a month. And I’ll never forget the day my usually quiet, reserved son snapped at her for trying to give away his Nintendo switch. If I wasn’t also fed up with her behavior I would have washed his mouth out with soap. I’ve had countless talks with her but she continues to do this. My son and I have resorted to locking up anything we didn’t want touched which is something we shouldn’t have to do in our own home.Last week I won a $300 tent in a raffle. I had no plans on using it so I was selling it. When I found a buyer and went to look for it I couldn’t find it. When I asked my wife she said she gave it to a friend of ours. I got mad at her and said she had no right to give it away. Her defense was since I didn’t spend money on it and was i planning on using it, it made sense to give it away for free. I told her that wasn’t her decision to make but she just kept repeating herself.I had enough of this and said she’s either going to pay me herself or get the money from who she gave it to, and if she didn’t I’d get law enforcement involved. Since she rather die than ask a friend for money she paid me out of her own pocket.This issue eventually got around to her family. While they did say she should have talked to me first they also reprimanded me for asking for payment. They reasoned that since I didn’t actually buy the tent I didn’t loose any money and it went to a friend who could actually put it to good use. I got several text saying I should be ashamed for extorting my wife for money. I think I have every right to want to be paid for something of mines that was taken but every one keeps emphasizing the fact that I didn’t technically buy the tent and didn’t want it so I have nothing to be upset about.

I have always told her until I feel that she is mature enough to speak about the conversation we will. But lately the past month she has been asking more and more and finally said well my dad has told me why so I don’t understand why can’t you. Her father 29 male has been speaking to my child and telling her his side of events that lead to us no longer being together. Now my daughter has anger towards me as she thinks I’m keeping secrets from her but I just keep telling her that conversation it between adults and not a child. I have been with my current partner male 30 for about two years and have recently had a new addition to our family. We have always done things together never leaving my daughter out. But as of couple of days she says she no longer loves him as he is the reason her dad and I can’t go back together. But her dad has had a relationship couple of months after our seperation but it seems her father cant do wrong only I. I have confronted my ex husband and the only thing he tells me is that he will not stop answering her questions due to her wanting to know and that he sees no wrong.UPDATE:Thank you for all the advices I have received but to answer two questions as they are being asked numerous times. I might have not worded it correctly 1. The reason of my divorce was due to multiple cheating that happened through our marriage during work trips and out of them 2. In our divorce I didn’t fight for anything as I just wanted our daughter to see how a healthy relationship should be between her father and I not once argued Infront of her.We divorce when she was just 2 years old since the day we both separated she understood as I always told her she appropriate information for her to understand. My ex husband and I had agreed that when she was 8 we will speak about the reason why our divorced happed which obviously that didn’t happen. Our daughter understands what it is to have two homes. And have our significant other in her life and what they represent which she has great relationships with them. I have done everything in my power for this not to affect our child. She understands it was not due to her and that we both love her so much what she is wondering as to why I don’t speak about the conversation is due to my ex saying that he tried to fix our marriage but I didn’t want to and that I left and took her with me. And blamed my current partner as to why mommy and daddy can’t no longer get back together as we have a child. Which I have the right to restart my life but in his eyes I do not have that right. Everything was calm in our divorce until I got married and had another child and which triggered him and started to tell our daughter information that we both discuss as of when it should of been said to her.My partner and I have both agreed that if he doesn’t want to take counseling we will be putting our daughter through it as I do want her to her that it has never been because of her but life took us in different path. She doesn’t hold any hate towards our newborn in the other hand she loves her and is a great big sister. She just feels that I need to be more open to her in certain conversations which I agree but to a certain limit. He father will always be her father but I just want him to understand certain things should involved our child as she is too young. Will be contacting my lawyer in regards to the proper steps I have to take to not allow this to happen once again. As I have done everything in my end to make him understand but doesn’t seem to be enough. I can’t dwell in what if he decides not to do anything until he is ready as this is not about him our I but about our child and what benefits her the most.But once again thank you for all the comments and advice that everyone has given me I do appreciate it.",

We use acrylics, and I work with kids on the younger side, so I’m always bound to get paint on my hands and clothes. I have one hoodie that I’ve designated as a painting sweater. I usually wear it on colder days and naturally it’s accumulated quite a bit of paint.I have lectures that happen a few hours after both sessions. I’m not pressed for time or anything, and of course I thoroughly wash my hands after every session, but if I’m honest, I just can’t be bothered to change out of my sweater and put on a new one—it’s a hassle to shove another bulky sweater in my backpack when I’m already carrying so many other things (and that’s not to mention how wrinkly it would be once I took it out). Quite frankly, I don’t really care if I wear the painting sweater to lectures, and I don’t think anyone else does either.When I came downstairs this morning, my mom looked me up and down and asked me if I was bringing another sweater to change out of for class. I said no, and she started doing the classic mom “Okay, but I’m judging you for it,” thing; raising her eyebrows, repeating something akin to “That’s really weird, but whatever,”My mom, ever with a flair for the dramatic, then started equating my wearing a sweater with paint on it in public to not caring about my appearance, expressing her ‘concern’ that I don’t care at all how I look. This bothered me, because it’s just blatantly not true. Equating me wearing a sweater with paint on it to generally just looking unpresentable in public is not at all the same thing, and I told her as such. She just kept repeating her point and begging me to take it off before class (I have a shirt underneath, but it’s freezing today, I am keeping that sweater on).My question is basically if everyone else finds this weird/inappropriate for me to wear my painting sweater in public.

He doesn't really have a job since he resigned from being a computer programmer nearly a decade ago so I have been relying mostly on my brother's monthly allowance to get by since my mother resigned from her job as well. Alex and my mother, Eden, are separated and don't really talk with each other due to some personal issues regarding their marriage.Before, Eden used to hold the bank card that my brother, David, would send money into and it would be her who then sends the money here. This had caused a bit of a struggle because money is usually short and we would barely be able to cover all of our daily expenses for the month. When I met up with her during Christmas however, she then gave me the card and said that I can keep it as long as I promised her that Alex doesn't know and that he won't be involved in our finances. She doesn't really trust my father with anything and since him and David had a recent falling out, he agreed as well. I said yes and accepted it because it would be much less of a hassle once I can control the money directly.When I got back however, I knew that I couldn't really keep it a secret from my father since most of our household expenses are intertwined and he doesn't have much of a source of income. I haven't been holding the money back and I have been paying what was needed but I haven't been eager to hand the money out either. This is because Alex doesn't really have the best track record of keeping money and I knew that my mother and brother would be disappointed in me if they found out how fast the money from the account went. They aren't really fond of him.Recently, Alex has compared me to our family members and is talking about how I am just like them. He says that he isn't out to steal my money and that he's hurt I think otherwise. He tried to start a conversation about how excited he was to hear that I won most of the New Year's games and how much I earned but I brushed him off because I was studying for my exams and I was worried about the brownout that wouldn't stop. I don't really think he's out to get me, I'm just worried since I know that Eden and David would scold me if they see that the money has been running away quickly when I am only one person. David has said before that he was willing to stop sending money when he and my father got into an argument so I don't really want to get on his bad side.

We would try and find out what topics she liked so that we could talk about those with her so she could be included too but she would not tell us as she would say that we wouldn’t find the same things interesting despite us insisting we would like to know. I only found out that she liked similar things to me when I had already left for a different school through posts she liked on instagram. I openly talked about these interests within a smaller group setting so she could have been included in the conversation too.In addition, we had a whatsapp group chat with all of us included and when we would make plans, she would never respond until we mentioned her only for her to immediately respond with no. This happened every single time to the point that in the initial invite messages we would mention her. At first we considered that she had strict parents and tried to make accommodations for her such as meeting up with her at her place and accompanying her out or choosing places close to where she lives, but we found out her younger sister is allowed to go out on sleepovers so we just assumed she doesn’t want to go out and therefore stopped including her in plans during our final year.It wasn’t until the end of year 12 (ages 16/17) that the friends that stayed at the school cut her off. Since then, her posts and reposts on tiktok have been about bad friends. We know that it is about us because we are the only friends she has had — her friend of 10+ years says Emily barely spoke to her or teachers.Emily says she has social anxiety and I understand how difficult it is to talk to other people when you have it but not even involving yourself in text conversations? She has made online friends and talks to them as well as talking to her younger sister’s friends, so are we actually the problem and being insensitive to this?My friends and I want to confront her and talk about it because we got annoyed at her for essentially bad-mouthing us yet she would still ask us to support her hobby accounts and be nice when we do have small interactions, essentially being two-faced.WIBTA?",

It happened multiple times.I know I should’ve stopped bringing it up in front of her, but at the time, I kinda didn’t know what I was feeling. I’m not very good at keeping track of my emotions, and I often snap out of nowhere. Like this instance.I snapped one day and said “You think that (the fact that she didn’t have a rebellious phase) is something to show off about?”Apparently, I sounded angry and it scared her.She grew all quiet after that, and she stopped talking to me. To be honest, I had no idea why she stopped talking at the time.After a few hours, she suddenly apologized to me for not talking to me. So I was like “ok. Why did you stop talking?” She said something vague like “I just realized that the way we think can be different” My clueless ass was like huh?? but I didn’t push it.Then she stopped talking to me for like. 2 fucking months. I would say hi to her when I got back home and she didn’t even turn around lmao.When I finally got her to say the reason why she stopped talking - the reason was the sentence in the title - she said “I was also upset that you didn’t apologize back when I apologized to you.”Honestly, I still don’t understand why it’s such a big deal to her. I have more to say but I’ll keep it short. Was I the asshole to say that?edit: I know this doesn't make much of a difference but istg I never yelled at her  I didn't raise my voice dfjlksdfjBut I understand why I was the asshole now. I apologized to her yesterday. To be honest, now that I understand how she felt, I feel embarrassed to think I was ever in the right lmao. The fact that I forgot I even snapped at her before she told me is kinda evidence of how thoughtless I was. Thanks for giving me some objectivity.",

Just some context.So she tells me a couple month ago she doesnt want to be in her home state for her birthday. She wants to be in lake tahoe, san fran, la, or montana.I usually make a ski trip out to Montana around this time. So i thought itd be cool to combine everything.I planned a ski trip that ends a day after her birthday. So i bought everything plane tickets, sleeping arrangements, food, etc. Mind you my friends would be gone for her actual birthday. I planned for it to be just us.So we wake up on her birthday i gave her a big hug offered to make breakfast and told her the day is yours baby, what do you want to do? Being that we are in montana and its snowing there is not alot to do. So i thought id have her pick so it we could do what she wanted to.Now she has been crying all morning. Im pretty sure its cus i didn’t give her the extravagant birthday morning with breakfast and balloons. Now she will barely talk to me. Would rather “be alone”. Idk what to do. I thought bringing her out here (where she wanted to be) would be a great birthday present. But now I’m not sure.Am I the Asshole?",

	"title" : "AITA for not changing my travel plans so that my co-parent can see our kids?",
	"body" : "So 18 months ago I split from my husband and we now amicably co-parent our 5yo and 3yo who are both very close to their dad. His work requires moving every few years and I followed him wherever he needed to go during our marriage but he never seemed grateful and didn't acknowledge that I sacrificed a lot for his job. He was also very assertive about the things he wanted to do and not do with his time so I didn't prioritize the things I wanted because I felt like I shouldn't inconvenience him.Our last move was close to my home town and we bought a house in order to settle here long term, thinking his moving days were done. After our separation our plan was still to live near to each other in this area for the sake of the kids. He has now been unexpectedly asked to do a 2 year project in a far away town. His plan is to try fly back every second weekend to see the kids.Working around his work schedule, I agreed to go away with the kids for a weekend next month, with some close friends who are visiting from overseas and have kids of the same age. He now wants to change his schedule, and wants me to leave the kids with him and not take them away with me that weekend. The reason is because his dad turns 70 the weekend before, so he now wants to go visit his dad that weekend instead of the kids.  If he does this, that means they don't see each other for 3 weeks.My answer to him was that I'm not willing to change my plans. I spent so long fitting my life into the gaps between his career and his plans, and I don't want to do that anymore. It feels unfair to ask me to not take the kids on this weekend away because he wants to change his schedule. I am finally planning things for myself. I obviously don't want the kids to not see their dad for 3 weeks, but it is his decision to move away and now to change his schedule at the last minute, but he expects me to change my plans to accommodate him and thinks I am being unreasonable by saying no. He says his dad's 70th birthday is more important than my weekend away with friends, and that immediately makes me feel guilty, but I also feel like that is an unfair summation of the issue. It's not like he asked nicely and acknowledged that it would be a sacrifice either, and I feel so tired of feeling like I don't matter. AITA for taking a stand on this?To clarify: grandad's birthday is happening the one weekend and he had originally not planned to go to it (different city) but he had planned to visit the kids. The following weekend is my weekend away and he had originally was not going to be in town. So he wants to go to his dad instead of to the kids, and then I leave the kids at home and go away without them so that he can visit them that weekend instead.",

	"title" : "AITA for getting upset when my partner continues to use my pre-workout supplement?",
	"body" : "TL;DR: Getting into arguments with my partner over her use of pre-workout without asking. AITA?CONTEXT/BACKSTORY: My partner(30f) and I(31m) have been getting into arguments over the usage of pre-workout for exercise. She practices yoga/ballet 5 days a week while I do typical weight lifting 3 days a week. I started to use pre-workout supplements to give myself an extra boost for my workouts. She tried it for energy with her exercise. I did not want her to use it frequently due to the high amounts of caffeine pre-workout can contain.Eventually, she began drinking the pre-workout I'd buy before her ballet lessons without letting me know, which annoyed me since she would use it without asking. While it would eventually be replaced, it was frustrating preparing for my routine, only to find that the container had significantly less powder than when I last used it, sometimes being near empty. Additionally, I had been working on our shared finances and was trying to maintain our budget and each container costs ~$20-$30, so I didn't want to have to frequently buy it.With the last container I purchased, I told her it was exclusively for me because I didn't think it was right for her to be drinking multiple energy drinks + take pre-workout. She has asked a few times to use it and I said yes whe she did ask, but recently she has been using it without asking. She never denies it when I ask, but I specifically bought this one just for me, and finding that she's using it without asking is upsetting because she would previously use the majority of it. This issue is popping back up because while the both of us had taken breaks from our exercise, we are both getting back into our routines (Her with ballet/yoga, me with weight lifting).We agreed to take it to the Internet counsel to settle the matter for us both.Her exact stance is\"It's a communal food item that I replace every time it's empty. You are never without it when you want to use it. It is not fair that I'm not allowed to use something we BOTH consume simply because you want to save your portion for a special time. If it's being replaced, and you do not have to go without, how much and how often I consume it is irrelevant.\"I don't see it as a communal food item since I've been purchasing it to specifically assist with my workouts. She compares it to buying food that sits in the fridge that someone else ends up eating after a while, meaning to her it should have been eaten sooner/earlier. I compare it to me using her makeup without asking(I don't actually) and using all of a certain product without her knowledge, only to find out its gone when she's trying to get dressed up. AITA for calling it out and getting upset when she uses it without asking or is she in the right?Edit: so people know this isn’t a serious or major fight between the two of us. Just something we keep butting heads over. Feel free to ask for additional info. We’re both going to go over it tonight when she’s off workEdit 2: Showed my partner the responses. She acknowledged that she doesn’t always replace it despite claiming so but agreed with me it doesn’t matter in the end. I’m just going to continue to purchase preworkout and treat it communally.She also was surprised everyone considered me controlling when she told me that she stopped because she found out she was drinking unsafe/lethal doses of caffeine. Her words and her research. I had already stopped complaining about it by the point she looked it up.I’m still the asshole according to public opinion though so there ya go. There’s no such thing as a right to ownership of items in a relationship",

	"body" : "I’m kind of torn here, and I’m not sure if I’m just being bitter.So I (25 F) had my first baby with my husband (29 M) back in August. She’s a good baby for her age, isn’t colicky and loves to play. However, she’s never been great with naps and she won’t take more than a 30 minute nap at a time. She sleeps a solid twelve hours at night so we know she’s getting enough sleep, it’s just hard sometimes to get anything done during the day, and it’s especially hard to put her down for a nap. From the beginning, my husband and I had discussed me going back to work. He teleworks 100% of the time, and I telework 50% of the time, because my job requires me to be in the field some days. I thought we were on the same page about this until today, when I had to go back to work.My husband was pouting this morning. I asked him what was wrong, and he sighed, stating “do you really have to go back to work?” I was confused, because we’d talked about this already, and I’d been reminding him my maternity leave was ending so this shouldn’t have been a shock. We’d also worked out us being the primary caretaker of our daughter every other day (when I’m teleworking I’ll watch her) and I thought this was fair. He then proceeded to go on and on about “what if I get fired” and “how will I have time to work” and empathized that I should just be a stay at home mom.This is where I start to get frustrated. I have been caring for my daughter 95% of the time since her birth. When she was a newborn my husband used to leave me by myself with her so that he could go off to DJ somewhere, or go over to his friends house to make music. I was the one waking all the time, every night, to care for her. I was the one that did all the regressions, growth spurts, and leaps. My husband, in my opinion, has had it easy with our daughter up until now because I’m not around to jump in when he decides things are getting too hard for him to deal with. It’s even in his job description that he’s allowed to do childcare while he’s working so that’s not even a good excuse.Now where I may be the AH is that ultimately, this isn’t our infant daughter’s fault. She can’t feed or put herself to sleep on her own and I’m worried she’s going to be all out of wack from him caring for her because he doesn’t always pay attention, he’s relied on me to watch her. Now I don’t know if I should just quit my job so I can watch her. I guess what I’m saying is I may be an AH because my daughter needs me, if that makes sense. AITA?",

I knew at least 2/3 of the guests and got along well with all of them. There was a $50 spending limit. I spent $51.23 but with our sales tax being almost 10% I went about $5 over the limit. I bought 3 unisex items, 2 of which were on super sale (30-50% off). Without the sale the total would have been around $80. I bought everything at target, it's not like any of the items were extravagant by any means although I got a lot of feedback that my gifts were creative and fun. Some people spent less than $50. For instance someone brought a lush bath set that I saw in store for $30. No issue with that at all just adding for context. I'd say most people spent right around $50.My gift was extremely popular. It was one of the first wrapped packages picked and before we made it through half the picks my gift had already been stolen the max amount of times and removed from rotation. I was super happy the final giftee was excited with the gift. Multiple people asked where I got the gifts and I told them on super sale at target. After the party I left for the holiday then a long vacation with my husband. I returned recently and heard through the grapevine a couple people were annoyed with my gift. Apparently they feel the $50 cap applies to the value of the gift not the sticker price and feel that i intentionally tried to upstage them. Hand to God I didn't, I thought if I spent $50 I was within the rules. For what its worth the 2 ladies annoyed with me are people I did not know prior to that night, and after apologizing to the hostess she reassured me i did nothing wrong and she loved what i brought. No one I know was upset with my gift either. But now I am questioning myself if I was an asshole for buying gifts that were worth more than $50?

My boyfriend is a very sweet guy in many ways, but one thing that I'm not so much a fan of is that he often hops on the bandwagon of hating on innocent things. Not just not liking something, but making sure everyone knows he doesn't like it even if nobody asked. I can't help but notice a theme: Pumpkin spice lattes, pouty selfies, Taylor Swift, etc. As you can guess, he is not a fan of of the food pics and thinks it's very annoying and cringe. He doesn't even follow my insta even though he has an account :(Even though I don't have very many followers, I have started getting occasional offers and invitations from restaurants in my city to try their food for free in exchange for a review. Nothing crazy—no steak dinners so far—but I've gotten a few sandwiches and several baked goods.Well, I just hit the big leagues and got invited to a new restaurant opening that includes a free appetizer and entree for me and one guest. I immediately invited one of my Instagram friends who I have gone out to eat with on several occasions and who also enjoys taking food photos. I told my boyfriend and he's pissed that I'm not taking him and says I'm doing it out of spite—I really think I'm not? If the restaurant is giving me free food in exchange for a post, I'm gonna put more effort into the post and spend a few extra minutes making sure that I actually get very good shots, and I'd rather do it with someone who isn't going to sigh and roll their eyes through the whole thing.

He introduced me to my now boyfriend 6 years ago who is a childhood friend of his. Sawyer and I used to be closer than he was to my boyfriend.The breakdown of our friendship started when I switched jobs and moved to a different city. I still tried my best to keep our friendship intact by always keeping him updated with my life, letting him hang out with me and my boyfriend even when we wanted alone time (we live 2 hours away so could only meet once a week), etc. Sawyer also used to take initiative initially. However, 2 years ago he started dating an extremely toxic woman, they got engaged but eventually broke up. I was never a fan of hers and let him know that (I was never rude about it but felt like I needed to speak up because she was making him miserable). That’s when he started really distancing himself. So I backed off as well. I still tried to maintain a healthy friendship, but he kept disappointing me by missing my birthdays and other important events, etc. One instance that really hurt me was when I was in his city for some work and had a few hours to kill, I asked if I could come to his house, but he declined because he was with his girl (they didn’t live together but got enough alone time with each other on a daily basis). So I had to spend 3 hours at a cafe alone.Overall, it didn’t seem like he was completely trying to cut me off because he would RSVP yes for events and even show excitement, but would not show up for underwhelming reasons (like he was out shopping with his girlfriend). Anyway, gradually I stopped making an effort with him. He didn’t tell me when they got engaged and when they eventually broke up.Since they broke up, we’ve tried to mend our friendship, although we never explicitly addressed the past. He got fired from his job last week and again didn’t tell me (I get updated on these things through my boyfriend who lives close to him so they keep more in touch). While I feel bad for him and want to reach out, I can’t help but feel that I’m no longer an important part of his life and he doesn’t need my support anyway. AITA?",

I asked Tia last year if she wanted to go on this trip with me, she said yes as long as her school schedule wasn't too busy; I asked her once school started again if she thought her school schedule would allow her to take the trip; she said yes but she would have to figure out someone to look after her cat while she's away. This hasn't been a problem for her before, so I figured she was good to go and I booked the trip, including about $2000 for a non-refundable hotel room and non-refundable city passes (about $200 each).Even though Tia has had a lot of notice about the trip, she still hasn't found someone to look after her cat. The two friends she would normally ask aren't able to watch him this time. I asked her if she had other friends to reach out to, and she said yes but that she hasn't done so yet. I also said I could ask some of my own friends if they could help, but she said she'd rather the cat stay with someone he knows.I suggested a pet sitting service that would come to her home and either check in on the cat every day or stay overnight for the duration of the trip, and I told her I would send her the money she needs to pay the pet sitter. I also suggested she could introduce the cat to the pet sitter in advance of the trip so she can make sure the cat is comfortable, and that she can ask the pet sitter to send her pictures of the cat and the litter box/food each day, or she could install a camera so she could watch the cat from her phone and make sure he's okay. She also has roommates who aren't big fans of the cat but could be present in an emergency; it's not like the cat would be left completely alone for 10 days.The closer our trip gets, the more anxious I'm getting about the lack of action she's taking to get the cat looked after. I obviously don't want the cat to be left alone or in an unsafe situation, and I think if she wants a pet sitter to come for 10 days in 3 weeks, she's going to need to book that pretty soon, especially if she wants the cat to meet the pet sitter in advance. I've been really looking forward to this trip and I don't want the money I've already spent to go to waste, and I also really want to go on this trip with her; I don't want to go by myself or have to try to find someone else to come with me.I think I've been putting some pressure on her about getting the cat looked after; I've asked her a couple of times in the past week whether she's taken any more steps to get it sorted, and I've reminded her how excited I am to go on this trip with her and how she's my favourite person to travel with. Her response has been she's still thinking about what to do with the cat, she wants to go on the trip with me, but I have to prepare for the possibility that she might not be able to figure things out for the cat and might not be able to come.AITA for putting pressure on her to find a cat sitter?",

She is literally begging me every time I move slightly or readjust to let her knit a row. If you don't know much about knitting then you know that different people have different knitting tensions and I knit very tight, someone coming in and knitting a row looser would destroy the 18 hours work I've put into this piece as I'd have to unpick and loosen the previous row.Anyways, I nipped to the loo the first time and I come back and my stuff isn't how I left it, she admits that she was going to knit more but the lady opposing us (we were on a table of 4) told her not to, and when I got my work I realised that she'd moved the stitches and they weren't in the correct order. I fixed this and carried on. I went to nip to the loo again and got to the end of the carriage and saw her reaching for my knitting stuff so I took it with me, and did so every time I went to the loo after that.She kept getting in my space and critiquing me and not leaving me alone. I ended up snapping \"If you wanted to knit you should have brought your own knitting and not be trying to do mine. F off\". She started crying and moved seats.

You can ask me questions if their is any confusion. When we started dating I was in my hometown preping for clg entrance. During that time he use to talk with many girls. I don't know if it was formally or more. But he use to tell me she likes him or she is beautiful or she has good height, intelligent etc. As it was my first relationship I was not really able to communicate my feelings that I am hurt or anything really well. Then I got selected in one of the prestigious clg that I was preparing for. There I became friends with few people. I got close to two person one was a girl and other a boy. As my clg campus is big and consist of more or less everything inside and is very safe you will find people roaming even at 3 in the night i.e. the campus never sleeps. So what happened is I use to walk with both them in night time sometime even till 12 in the night. He has one friend in my clg who is my senior he told him that I was alone in the night walking with him in the night time. And he started feeling that I will cheat on him with that person. But that individual is not my type and I don't like him in that way. Because of which we had really really nasty fights. As at that time I was feeling like he is trying to control my life and friendship and all. I called him very nasty words too like you are toxic mad etc. Then what happened is the guy with whom I was roaming with talked in a very harsh way with my bf that I didn't liked a bit. So I completely cut my contact with that guy. I tried to mend my relationship but it is a big scar in my relationship till now. So today what happened is that I just asked my bf to share his screen just to check what is my name in his phone and see the goofy pics he took of mine during video call. At that time I saw a pic of a girl in his gallery. I asked him who is she, he said she is my elder sister the picture was not completely visible. But by mistake he clicked on that picture and I saw the contact name. She was not her sister but a screenshot of status of one of his friend(abby). So about that friend he told me that Abby is a guy as they use to talk at night for studying. But the pic was of a girl and same pic was their as her profile pic too.

Nobody in my family is rich besides my dad and grandpa, neither of which were able to make it, but I still went, as well as my grandma, my cousin, my brother, and our significant others. My grandma was the only person who brought a present as joining my aunt for this expensive dinner was all we budgeted for her birthday.Throughout the meal, my grandma was checking out all the prices and ordered the cheapest options, meanwhile my aunt ordered the most expensive steak, asked for an added lobster tail ($50 itself) and ordered a dessert and a second meal to go. Essentially, she was set to eat for the week when it came to box up leftovers. She also ordered an alcoholic beverage even though she can’t medically drink alcohol, but took a few sips.When the check came, my grandma was in the bathroom. The server asked how to divide it and my aunt said to put her food on my grandma’s tab. She snickered and I guess the rest of us thought she was just playing a prank. But when my grandma got back and got her bill, she just about had a heart attack before she realized what happened, and told my aunt that she couldn’t afford it (for context, my grandma recently had to sell her house and get a job out of retirement because she is literally broke). My aunt argued, saying things like “Well don’t you have a credit card”, “If I was one of your dogs you would”, and “Well Dad would pay for it if he was here” (again, my grandpa is rich and definitely could afford it). My grandma just kept insisting she couldn’t afford it, getting more and more sad and ashamed.Finally I just put my credit card on the table and said “I’ll pay for it. Just shut up.” She then argued that I am her nephew and shouldn’t have to pay for her meal, but that her mom should because it’s her birthday. This also got my grandma to offer to put all the cash she had ($100) for the bill and my aunt payed the rest (over $150). My aunt further made comments that “She paid for her own birthday dinner” and how sad that was. My grandma’s food was $30 max. So she still paid for a significant portion.After that, my husband and I got the heck out of there. We hugged everyone except my aunt, and just left. I let my cousin know that we were no longer talking to her mom for now and didn’t invite her to either of our birthday celebrations. When my grandma found out she was pissed, as was my aunt who found out from my grandma.Since it has been almost two years, I have texted my grandma and aunt on their birthdays and holidays to no response.

It wasn't pretty, because even though he stayed in the same city (though on the other end of it) we've seen each other maybe once every week or two. Our family took a big hit during that time, cause 3 days after he left, my mom's father died, and our dad didn't stay long to support us (he stayed for the funeral and two days after, but then he left, though my mother begged him on her knees to stay).The next year was extremely stressful because my mother was constantly trying to hold us together while helping my grandma and keeping us in our house. I tried to help, but I was finishing high school and was studying hard for my finals to go to college.TBF my father kept sending us money, around 1200 dollars which helped a lot. But then he got together with the woman he cheated with, and the money stopped flowing so freely. I suspect because she tries to keep him away from us and direct his attention towards her two kids (which she's been successful at)I didn't care about this much, because I've never needed much, but my mother needed this money to help us survive and let us stay in our family home. So, fearing that he would stop paying, she signed a contract with him in front of a notary that made sure that he would be paying those 1200 dollars and pay for half of our school and medical expenses.Tbf she didn't have to, because in my country child support is mandatory until 26 years old if the kid is still studying (that includes college, which I go to), but my father's money (which he has a LOT) are mostly under the table so she wanted some insurance, that he would pay that exact amount.Back to todayMy father haven't pay his share for my third year in college (I covered it) and pays around 494 dollars monthly (which is for both me and my brother), saying that he won't pay more because it will go to my mom and her new husband.But... I started living alone a few months ago, so it doesn't make any sense and my mom never used that money on herself to begin with.

I'm meeting with him to discover why, but Reddit... Am I the asshole to expect him to pay? I don't ask him for anything, tbh I'm too afraid to do so. I know that every time I do so, he will spit it in my face sometime later, or will subtract the value of it from my child support even though he says it's a gift.

Us and a group of friends went out this weekend to stroll around the city and explore, and stopped at a coffee place to get something to drink while we walked. I ordered a small coffee, but when I went to tap my debit card, it wasn't working (dumb problem with my bank, have resolved it since). I asked if anyone could spot me this one time and Rebecca paid for my coffee. I thanked her, it was like 2 dollars. We just walked around and did some window shopping and all seemed to be fine.As we were wrapping up and walking back to campus, Rebecca said \"Oh yeah, OP, you owe me for that coffee earlier.\" I laughed because I genuinely thought she was joking and a few other girls laughed too. Rebecca immediately got defensive and it became clear she was serious. I said, \"Oh, sorry, I thought you were kidding because it was like $2.50...\" Rebecca went on this weird rant about how I don't know her status and how I was making her feel bad about her income and how I was being really classist and weird about something that wasn't that big of a deal. This made me see red because Rebecca is RICH. Like generational wealth rich. She didn't even need to go to college, but she went because her parents thought it would be good for her and she wanted to have the \"college experience\". Yes, this girl is basically at university for fun. She also makes a lot of ignorant comments about other people's money and income.I pointed this out to her and said that while two dollars isn't that big of a deal at all, it was ridiculous for her to ask for it paid back when she has millions of dollars in a trust fund since she was born. She got really upset at this and stormed off, then sent me a series of pissed texts and hasn't replied to me. The other girls agreed that she was being stupid but they also said I was being petty because two dollars isn't a big deal for either of us, so I should just pay it back to her. While it's true that two dollars isn't much, it's more the principal of the thing for me now. How can she accuse me of classism when she is not only rich, but greedily scraping back every penny she spends on others? I do think I may have gone too far by humiliating her and bringing up her family in front of so many people, some of which weren't aware of her situation and now think she's an idiot. AITA?EDIT: I didn't mention I have bought Rebecca things many times before, totalling up to a lot more than $2.50. Including a meal (at a fast food place) because she forgot her money, and never once did I ask for her to pay me back. I don't understand how she can be so petty to ask me for such a small amount when I have had her back so many times before for so many more things.",

She told me she’s “in a hurry” and “here now” so she needs to get her products. I told her once again we’re not open, the registers aren’t up and she does not have the right to just shove the door open because she wants to shop now. I also offered to go pick the products and have them ready for her so she can be in and out quickly but she told me she doesn’t know what she wants and she’ll know it when she sees it.

I had more opening tasks to do and if I continued arguing we couldn’t have opened on time anyway. She proceeds to leave which I do feel bad about and then a few hours later a review was left stating discrimination and the “kid (I’m 23 but look young I guess) at the door refused service to me”.

The original plan was to take my sister (13) but since she's too young my parents didn't want me to go alone with her in case something happened to one of us. Fair enough. So I asked my dad to come with me instead, it's not a case of choosing my dad over my mum, me and my mum work in the same place and we wouldn't be able to get the same week off. I also can't afford to take 4 of us. My parents are really struggling financially atm so they can't really put anything toward it.It's also not really possible because there is only one week in the year that all 4 of us are off and it's a week in August. That week is totally booked everywhere. So even if I could afford to take my mum and sister too (my sister would cause us a fine for taking her out during school time on top of that) we can't even get the same week off anyway. So essentially I'm now being guilt tripped for not either, changing my destination to somewhere I don't really want to go/can't afford and going August, or not waiting until next August.I don't think it's fair that I'm being expected to only go away when we all can.

	"body" : "Hello, I (20M) lost my cat of 18 years about a month ago. It's my first time losing someone and it's been pretty hard, especially cause usually when I'm sad or distraught I hug my cat, but now she is gone. I've been thinking of getting a new cat to bring a little more joy into my life and help with my grief, but I wasn't sure if it would be too short a time, so I consulted my family. My grandparents said I absoloutly should go get a cat if it helps me grieve and that it isn't too soon at all. My parents and sister also agree that getting a cat again would probably help us all, as we've all been pretty sad. The problem comes with my other sister, who says she is not ready. She isn't sure how long it will take her to be ready either. When she was a kid, she lost her cat and it took her a long time to get over it, she was still not ready by the time we got our recent cat (the one who just died) and she really hated our new cat for a while. I don't want to get a cat before she's ready and I certainly don'twant her to have distain for it, but I don't know how long that will take, last time it was years. I don't know if i can spend even another month without a cat. All my family is saying to get one anyway, and i really want to, but I don't want to prioritise my own grief over hers. Everyone grieves differently and it seems our grieving processes do not align very well. Would I be the asshole if I got a cat anyway? Should I wait a bit longer? Not get one at all? I'm not sure what to do. It's hard to think clearly with so much pain, but I certainly don't want to bring more pain to any of my family.Edit, as it may not have been clearWe do live together with our parents and other sister, so this cat would be in her living space as well as mine. If we lived seperate I wouldn't be too worried, I have a brother but he has moved out. It's mostly just cause I don't want to infringe on her space with a cat that will bring her more grief.",

This has been an issue for quite some time in our relationship to be honest. Years ago, I was constantly being put in situations of having to hear him and his friends talk about stories of this ex or that ex. I finally worked up enough courage to explain that this hurt my feelings to have this done in front of me repeatedly. It took a lot of explaining on my part, just that if it’s not relevant anymore, why does it always have to come up in conversation, especially in front of me? Also, just to me personally, the more you talk about something, it’s obvious that it still bothers you/you still care about it. So fast forward, he says he understands and has to tell his friends to knock it off and things get better. However, we live in a small town, so not only do we see his exes often…but we also attend social gatherings with multiple said exes. I told him how uncomfortable this makes me feel sometimes and I get super anxious leading up to these events because of this fact. My husband drinks pretty heavily and is a bit flirtatious, so naturally I get upset when he does this with other females especially when it happens with an ex. I’m constantly having to explain to him why this upsets me and asking him to stop. I’m just exhausted trying to explain to my husband how a decade long constant battle of begging for respect and just common courtesy to the person you claim to love and their feelings can be pretty soul crushing. I feel like I’m just being manipulated and gaslit anytime I try to explain it in a different way. I’ve tried being calm and explaining it from the way that it just hurts me and it kind of breaks my heart little by little each time. He gets defensive and says I’m just insecure and I don’t want him to talk to anyone except me and never leave my side. He says I never let him go do anything without me and that I just get mad at him if he does do anything. I guess I’m just trying to get an opinion other than my few girlfriend’s perspectives. Am I being immature and insecure? Or should I change my expectations/standards and not get so upset by these things? Would that make me happier to just not be so bothered by everything? Am I narcissistic or controlling and need to stop my behavior and get out of my own way? I’m just tired of being unhappy all the time or anxious/nervous of every thing we go and do because of who will be there or how he will act or if he will hurt my feelings again. I feel like the sad little kid in the corner not getting picked for the team when watching my husband give other people attention and ignore my wants/needs.Edit to add: yes, we do have kids.

	"body" : "I'm 15f.My great aunt married my great uncle when I was very little. I was never very close with either of them, as I was always slightly terrified of men who weren't my dad because of my mom's ex-boyfriend who made it painfully obvious he hated little 6 year old me. I only ever really saw my aunt and uncle on Thanksgiving or Easter, because they always made the family dinners. This summer, however, that changed.My great aunt's nephew, my uncle (different uncle), was diagnosed with brain cancer. My nana asked my great aunt if she would let him live on hospice in her house because her own was far too small and messy. She agreed with no hesitation and my great uncle did as well.I practically lived down there the first few weeks of summer until he passed, even then I went to their house almost everyday to make sure my nana, who was his mother, was okay. My great uncle always made sure to have biscuit's prepared for me when I got there. He even taught me to drive because my dad was always busy with work.My mother struggles financially and has no way of transportation for me. I'm an athlete who also has various appointments each month, such as therapy and the orthodontist. So it was getting increasingly difficult to ask my friends and neighbors for rides. (My dad would do it, but they're no longer together and he lives 20 minutes away from my mom and works.) My uncle started giving me rides to where I needed to go, which I appreciate greatly.He even drives a 45 minute drive to pick me up for school in the mornings and sometimes after practice as well. He gets me food everyday and I appreciate it. But sometimes he oversteps his boundaries in my opinion.I went through a breakup recently and anytime I would cry in front of my uncle he would get angry at me and yell at me and say there was \"no sense in crying over a boy.\" He later apologized for that when I obviously started giving him the silent treatment because he was upsetting me.He gets angry if I call anyone but him for a ride. I called my nana to pick me up from practice because I missed her and wanted to see her. My uncle found out and called me and was angry I didn't call him. He was half-joking, but why does it matter if I wanna spend time with my nana?He's done little things, such as threatening to take my phone if I didn't put it down, threatening to whip me (not weirdly, he just believes that whipping should still be used as a punishment), getting mad if I don't call him and tell him news that aren't his business anyways, etc.Sometimes it's just frustrating because it feels as though he's trying to overstep and be a father-figure towards me when I have an amazing father already. I love my uncle, but sometimes it just feels like he sees me as his daughter, which I'm not. It would be different if I had grown up close to him, but I didn't.

This past Christmas, my boyfriend and I decided to go on our first trip together (2N3D) over Christmas weekend to celebrate the holidays, in which we would be back home morning of Christmas Day.  He just recently started a new job, so he could not take the day off the Friday before so that we could come back Sunday morning (Christmas Eve) instead.We booked this trip 2 months in advance and I told my parents when we had first booked the trip to let them know I would not be able to have dinner with them on Christmas Eve (My mom works on Christmas Day so they decided to have dinner the night before Christmas). Thus, I celebrated Christmas early with my parents the Friday before and they decided to spend Christmas with my sisters on Christmas Eve.My 28F sister also planned a trip with her boyfriend to go overseas over the weekend, but needed to come back Christmas Eve as she she had to work on Christmas Day, which I did not find out until weeks after I had already booked our trip.Fast forward to the morning of Christmas Eve, I get a message from my 30F sister essentially yelling at me saying that I don't care about family, and that I chose my boyfriend over my family, and that \"I ruined Christmas for the family\", and that she wouldn't have gotten mad if my 28F sister didn't come back home Christmas Eve since \"when would she ever be overseas\" (28F sister had said she would have spent Christmas Eve overseas if it weren't for work.). I feel like this is such a hypocritical opinion because all in all, a trip is a trip. Distance of destination shouldn't be the forgiving factor. To give context, I have a very broken relationship with my 30F sister. I've been bullied by her since childhood, and we argue every time there is a family dinner, even as adults. I'm sick and tired of arguing with her at this point in life, but she always finds ways to nitpick on what I do.I talked to my mom about this situation, and she doesn't think I am in the wrong. She said relationships are important too and that my sister just doesn't understand because she's never been in a serious relationship before, and that she'll be more understanding once she does.I wanted to get away from the house for the first time since I moved back home, and really didn't think it was such a big issue I spent one holiday away from home. We had just had a family dinner early December to celebrate my parent's wedding anniversary, so it's not like family dinners are a rare occurrence.  I WFH and have dinner with my parents every night. Reason I bring this up 1 month after the fact is because my 30F is still angry at me and still messaging me about it, and is saying she's cutting me out of her life, saying \"she has better things in life to do than talk to me\".AITA?",

	"body" : "Context: I am a cosplayer I make videos and post them to Tiktok In August 2022 I had bought tickets to a convention in London taking place in October. I had decided to make a cosplay of a cosplayer that was pretty well known of as I had enjoyed their cosplays for months before, Whilst I was creating this cosplay I found out the cosplayer was actually a moderator to a discord server talking about a meetup to the same convention I was going to, on top of that they had put a public invite out in one of their videos so anyone could join, and in a heartbeat I joined and had told them in a general chat they I was cosplaying their character from one of their series. It took until basically the last few days I had left to complete the cosplay but I finished it and was actually able to meet up with the cosplayer that I was cosplaying. they had asked me for a photo and even dm'd me asking for my Instagram handle so they could tag me in a photo. I was 15 and they were in their 20s at this point.Anyway a couple months pass and I had forgotten about the cosplay until February (I was 16 now as my birthday was in January) so I thought why not use the cosplay in videos so I made a bunch of videos that were basically referencing the cosplay and where it was from and a bunch of that stuff. Now whilst making these videos I had been using a hashtag that was their Tiktok handle. I didn't even realise I was doing it until it was pointed out to me so I clicked on the hashtag and realised that I was the only person using it, and had technically taken it over, so I posted a video joking about it and moved on. Well a couple weeks later and another content creator who was a friend of the cosplayer had seen my video and made a response to it, it wasn't anything serious but to sum it up, it was basically a call out post saying that they were going to try and take the hashtag over, they also said that they were asked to do this by the cosplayer. They didn't mention me by name but because I had like 20 posts on the hashtag is was pretty blatant that they were referring to me.Now I made a jokey response to the video basically saying that this would be a war that I would definitely lose in seeing as I had like 100 followers and they had multiple thousands, a few hours later I deleted the video as it felt kinda rushed and I didn't like it (it was rushed). I also commented on their video because I wanted them to know I had seen it. The following weekend they deleted my comment, and had blocked me on both of their accounts. I was a little upset because I had watched their content aswell in late 2020 but I got over it as the weekend passed. Then during the next week the cosplayer had also blocked me now this hit me hard and I won't lie I skipped school and kinda just cried it off for the whole day.So AITA",

	"body" : "For some context, I’m (22F) currently living with a friend (23F) and her family b/c of some complicated stuff that happened in the past.That being said, I live in a dominican/hispanic household where my friend and her brother (24M) were raised kind of traditionally (women cook and clean/men provide financially).The thing is, I never feel comfortable cooking for my friends brother because /he/ never cooks or cleans. I grew up in a household where it didn’t matter if you were a man or woman, cooking and cleaning were basic life skills and you had to learn them. To add onto this, I’m not particularly close with her brother either.The last time I tried to cook for my friend (and my friend only) he kept hovering around the kitchen, opening and closing cupboards absentmindedly, trying to bring quiet attention to himself, and I started to feel a little guilty for not cooking any for him.I told my friend (privately) that I don’t want to cook for him because he never helps out with household chores, and she said: “that doesn’t mean he doesn’t deserve to eat!” as if someone cooking for him is his only lifeline and only way of getting food…She also made the excuse that he financially contributes to the home, but so do I. I pay rent to their mother every month, so I don’t see how he can’t cook/clean too.I get the feeling that he doesn’t appreciate that I don’t cook for him, but if I’m financially contributing to the home, cooking AND cleaning while he plays video games all day, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth I guess.Edit: Since people were getting confused, there’s only 4 people in the household. My friend, her brother, their mother and myself. My friend and her mother both cook and clean and my friends brother doesn’t help with any household chores.My friend and her mother cook, but they’re both so busy with work that sometimes my friends brother won’t get anything to eat until their mother comes home to cook for him. Their mother doesn’t get back until late at night, meaning I don’t really get the chance to cook for her (b/c I sleep early). I cook for my friend on occasion but most of the time I’m just cooking for myself.",

	"body" : "I've been going over this in my head for a bit and I would appreciate some opinions.I (36F) have spent my career so far working totally meaningless office jobs that also slowly treat you worse and worse. I decided to get out while I could and try to find a different career. I decided to try to get into tech and was able to find a job that pays well for my area and doesn't care that I don't have much in the way of education, certs, or experience in exchange for doing low level work (I'm pretty much pulling cables + some customer service).I'm now a little more than a month in and I'm finding I actually enjoy the work more than I thought (electrical circuits are neat!) and I'm considering staying at this level and really working on these skills. Also, my new co-workers are all actually pretty great. The manager actually cares about the team and does as much as she can to support us. Just about everyone is friendly and willing to help me out as much as they can.The bad news is that the job is with a big company and the owners are far more interested in trying to squeeze as much money out of this corporation as they can. It's mostly typical American corporate standard BS, way understaffed, very little training or resources, sales doing all kinds of shady shit, outsourcing, high turnover, etc. There's no way I can stay here without getting totally burnt out in a year.I'm seriously considering seeing if I can get in with our local union, if I do I'd have to quit my current job. They are already understaffed and there's a hiring freeze, if I go they could get stuck in an even worse position. I'd feel like a bit of a dick leaving them like this. Especially since I'm not like who they usually hire and the manager kind of took a chance on me.TLDR: started a job in a totally new field, realized I actually like it and the co-workers are great but the employer sucks balls, so I'm considering quiting.Will I be the asshole if I leave? Would it be worth staying? Is there another option I'm not seeing?",

It was his decision, & I accepted it as terms of our marriage. SIL (F/52) left for college at 18 & never moved back, living under 3grs away. She doesn’t work & has been a stay-at-home Mom for 18 yrs. Hubs worked in a factory f while I started my business & did not have leniency to help IL’s. The first 5 yrs I was in business I was the one taking care of them when needed. They were more mobile and my FIL still drove then, but it was me who sacrificed days I should have been at my office to tend to them. Income was tight but we always made it work. Last yr, Hubs was driving through her town & asked SIL to breakfast. He asked her to help with MIL’s eye appointments which are every scheduled every 8 weeks, plenty of tome to plan around. We handle all of the day-to-day, from grocery shopping to taxi for all other necessities. In addition, when there’s an emergency, which with the elderly happens often, we handle that as well. [Examples: FIL mobility is declining so Hubs goes over to help him shower once a week. When he can't stand he has to drive over to help him stand up; including from the toilet. MIL bladder fell out & called me at 9pm & I took her to OBGYN following morning at 8am.]Fast forward 6 months & Hubs called SIL to ask when she'll be able to help. After reminding her that he asked for help months ago, SIL became agitated. SIL: I don’t live there. Hubs: It’s a day trip, we make 1 day trips to visit you all the time (2 weeks prior for nephews Grad party, drove down & back in the same day w/ IL's). SIL: Well, I’m busy (as she was packing for last min trip to Hawaii with her family). Hubs: We are too. SIL: I have the kids. Hubs: So do I, & mine are younger. SIL: Yeah, well mine are \"active\" (said condescendingly). Hubs: I've been taking care on Mon & Dad 3 years, I need help. SIL: (very aggressively) It has NOT been 3 years, it’s been 1. Hubs: I’ve been getting their groceries since Covid & that was 3 years ago! Me: (in the background not yelling but apparently loud enough that I was overheard) I did it for years before you could because of your job. SIL: I don’t need to hear HER mouth in the background. Hubs: (sigh) we work... SIL: Well, from everything Mom & Dad told me, you owe them.Hubs drove to IL's to confront IL's who were mortified & said they never insinuated we owed them anything, and that we didn't. The next morning, I sent a group text to SIL, BIL, Hubs. But at the last second, I also included my FIL. My thought, she was the one who brought them into the conversation as her source, may as well make sure we’re all on the same page. I told her she was gross & out of line. An hour later BIL text me saying I had every right to feel the way I did but did not have to include FIL on text I that I ruined the family with my big mouth by doing so.

We had a few interesting conversations about our interest here and there. But for the most part, our chat remained very surface level.Fast forward one month later, and I began feeling anxious/depressed due to family trauma, especially since it was during the holiday season where I had no choice but to see my family, even if I secretly didnt want to. This led me losing motivation/interests to chat with this guy over the course of next month. I barely made effort to actively engage in our conversation and kept my responses short. It was bad enough that I would only text him a quick hello once a week (if he texted me first) before ending our conversation.Last weekend, I decided that I would stop pursuing my friendship with this guy as it was clear that my depression was clouding my judgement and stopping me from continuing to talk with him. But I didnt want to just ghost him the next time he texted me, since I believe ghosting people out of nowhere is a very asshole-ish thing to do. And so when he greeted me this last weekend, I became honest and told him that I need time alone due to family trauma (implying that I wont be talking to him for awhile) I also said Im sorry for letting him down. I tried to be as polite as I could.Unfortunately, he didnt take it too well. He seemed upset and thought I was an asshole for turning him down like that. And he told me to no longer text him afterwards. I understand he has every right to be mad at me, but I was not expecting him to take it this badly. I can understand his frustration if we had been long-time best friends for 1 year, but we've only been casual surface-level friends for 2 months. Now Im beginning to wonder if I could have handled this situation better.AITA for turning down a 2-month long casual friendship with this guy due to my depression?",

	"title" : "AITA for being concerned with my sister's social skills?",
	"body" : "I (22F) have a younger sister named Mabel (20F). Growing up, Mabel was always very academically inclined. However, she was also always shy. She got bullied a lot in grade school for reasons such as being \"too fat\" \"too weird\" \"too crazy\" \"a crybaby\" \"too ugly\". Mabel just wanted to show up and get her responsibilities done to the best of her abilities. She had some friends but has since lost contact since leaving grade school for high school (she had no phone at the time).When she was in 4th grade, a few boybands came onto the scene. That was one of the more difficult years as that was one of the peaks of bullying she endured, plus our parents were getting divorced and her teacher at the time favoured the boys who bullied her. She did admit to trying to fit in during this period. She started listening to them and they seemed to help her get through these hard times. Once finished all schoolwork, she would listen to their music and read as much as she could about them to learn as much as she could about them. She is still a walking encyclopedia about these bands to this day, and since then LOTS more information about the individuals in the bands and stuff has been coming out. She sometimes tends to harp on things for too long or monologue about them, and this was no exception. When asked to talk about something else, she would go quiet, though she says its hard for her brain to think about other things outside of school sometimes because she really loves the bands.There was also an incident in high school where two girls were gossiping about her in front of our mom at the grocery store, calling her \"weird\". There's one who I suspect envies Mabel because Mabel had better grades than she did, especially in English. Also, a guy that she liked was staring at Mabel's butt and not her and that made her upset.Mabel is now in a prestigious university and doesn't see any of them. I noticed that others were nice in high school, though it didn't seem like Mabel tried to get close to any of them. I thought uni would be a good opportunity for her to learn social skills and branch out and make friends.Recently, she and I were on the train, as I work near her uni and was thus helping her find classes and stuff (also there have been crime incidents on public transport so I wanted to keep her safe). A uni classmate came up to her and said \"Hello\" and Mabel was sharing how her Christmas went. The classmate then proceeded to ask Mabel about band C, the least mainstream of the bands she liked. Mabel said she didn't have time to check as she had been busy. They then proceeded to talk about their classes and TikTok.I asked Mabel why she was talking about band C with classmates, as I told her she shouldn't because the topic is niche and I worry that her peers would find her weird for liking that band. I asked her who mentioned band C first, and she said she didn't remember. She also talked about them at our Halloween party. AITA?",

He dies suddenly without warning. My FIL died in January of 22 from broken heart syndrome. I've always been close to my husband's family. They love me. The death of my husband didn't change anything between us, it united us. My MIL and I speak every day. We are close.Info: After losing 2 family members in such a short time, after the funerals, solving the estates, etc, we talked about taking a family trip. A week in a cabin in the woods by the lake, or going to Disney, or somewhere in Europe. Do something for us, to feel better.The plan was always to go me, my two BILs, SIL, and MIL.Last year BIL and SIL went to London for their honeymoon. They had been together for 25 years and after having kids that are now adults, decided to go on that trip. When they returned, they mentioned wanting to go to Italy in 2024. BIL (P) mentioned wanting to go, and I too said I wanted to go. MIL too. We decided that this would be our family trip after dealing with two deaths.I mentioned how important that trip was, as I've been dealing with grief and really needed it. Every time the occasion came and we talked about Italy the conversation was the same. We can't wait! It'll be fun! We need it! It'll bring us closer as a family!Not once did I hear, or felt like I wasn't part of that conversation. Not once. Always included, and no one ever mentioned that I wouldn't be welcomed.Tonight MIL messaged me and we talked about her day. Then, she mentioned that BIL, SIL, and BIL2 are going to Rome in May. She said she couldn't afford it so she's not going and is sad. This was news to me. I replied that I was hurt and heartbroken that I wasn't asked. Especially after talking about a trip and Italy for so long. I was honest with my feelings and told her it would change things for me and the family and how much part of it I feel.She mentioned how for Christmas they bought me my car carpets, and they were expensive and how I shouldn't feel sad or less part of the family or less loved by them. They assumed I wouldn't be able to afford it (I can). They thought I wouldn't like it because I prefer to plan ahead while they don't (It doesn't matter to me).I told her that the carpet and the trip were two different conversation for me. That it didn't change anything, they didn't ask. Or even consider me once. All the trip was discussed, planned, and paid without asking me once. I apologized for making her feel like I sounded like I wasn't thankful, but as a widow who is lonely, I was really looking for that trip.I want to call BIL tomorrow and ask what happened. If I did something to make them feel like I couldn't be part of the trip. I genuinely wanna know.WIBTA?",

Every  night we spend time together talking, watching something, or play games. Shes a funny girl who makes me laugh and creates plans for us and she also helps me sometimes financially. However there's some factors that affect that.For instance, she gets really agressive over certain things. Especially when she is on her period, she excuses that its her period making her yell at me when i make a simple joke or do a simple mistake. There's other times like this to but i always try to be understanding of how she feels. She is also passive agressive where i am having a conversation with her in which she responses back very condescending..She has stated she has depression too. She says \"i hate my life\", \"i am so overwhelmed\", \"i am sad\" almost all the time and i have tried to be there for her but it's really hard when she is projecting how she feels on me.And because of all of this, i finally decided to tell her today as she was asking me why am i acting differently recently. She asked \"where is your support? All i want is to feel your support\" and so i started with that i have been questioning the relationship. Unfortunately this was cut short as her mom called her saying her grandma is in the hospital as she had a heart problem. We later resumed our conversation in which i felt even more bad because her grandmas in the hospital.

And so ultimately i told her about her depression, her being passive agressive all the time, and how she handles certain situations. She made excuses for each thing i explained to her saying its something i need to adapt to and that i cant change her depression and that only she can which i understand. Feeling like she just didnt take much of what i said.... i told her i am sorry. I understand all of youre saying. I really wanna work this out but rn i feel two sides of me telling me we can work this out and another telling me to just leave, that i am not ready.She didn't like this and she told me that i was a coward then and that she didn't want me then if thats how i think.

WIBTA if I simply not attend graduation party and not invite anyone?I was raised by my mother. My father was that one-visit-every-two-years type of figure, and is not a part of my life.My mother agreed to support me as I moved away. She is wealthy, so it was not a heavy burden on her budget.. I had a full scholarship for university, and she had to pay only for food and housing. We never had a good relationship, and when I moved away it became harder and harder for her to abuse me (physically and psychologically). So, of course, she started holding financial support over my head as a weapon, as well as character assassination.I was a good, hardworking kid, and had good grades. But my family to this day believes I am a drug addict, a party girl and a financial burden on \"my poor parents\". My attempts at correcting this never went well, so I stopped trying, and let people believe whatever they want to believe.Throughout the years mother would call me, threaten to cut me off (leaving me unable to buy food and pay for rent), unless XYZ conditions were met (like calling her every day, or making social media posts glorifying her, or losing weight, or installing a tracking app on my phone so she would know my location at all times). She would also call me during my classes, bombarding me with 10 to 30 calls, and when I would step out of class to pick up, she would accuse me of being out somewhere doing drugs, and say that she \"KNEW\" I had dropped out (which I had not).These insane interactions always left me feeling hopeless, and trapped. So I started working to support myself, doing whatever I could. At some point I was pulling 50 hour shifts at odd jobs just to make ends meet, so at age 23 I was burned out, had awful grades, lost my scholarship and decided to drop out until I could sort out my finances. My mother would send money every once in a while, but I no longer relied on her to pay my bills and heavily denied any offers of help from her.Now, at 27 I am finally graduating and getting my bachelors. I managed to go back, and to build my grades back up through my own means. Now she's hearing of it, she wants to attend graduation, and \"be a part of what she's helped me build\". I don't want her there. She will try and make it all about her, and meet my teachers, and meet my friends... And I just do not want to have a special moment in my life ruined by her antics.Family members have been messaging me calling me selfish.

BMFH was planning HERSELF a party and just didn’t want to be stuck with the full bill. She planned to be black out drunk. Mind you, this woman is WELL out of her partying age. She planned to be ill behaved on every one else’s dime. When everyone told her “we can’t afford this kind of trip”, she flipped her lid. Saying we had months to save up. We knew an expense was coming. We have our own savings, but we can’t afford these $5k houses for a weekend. Plus all the “debauchery” she has planned for herself. So it all blew up and now a few girls have totally backed out and Sarah just feels alone. We’re trying to save her trip and not let it go to waste but BMFH is just impossible. Long story even longer, once she was called out, she got super defensive and even tried to turn it on the other girls saying it’s their fault they can’t give Sarah the party she wanted.",

	"body" : "My girlfriend and I are both in college at the moment and we have been dating for almost a year. We each have our own separate apartments, but for the past several months we’ve only been staying at her apartment. We don’t see each other during the winter and summer breaks because we live in separate towns so we have to do long distance.After this past summer break, I stayed over at her place several nights then she stayed over at mine. Eventually, it got to the point where I was just staying at her apartment every single night. Last semester, I felt like this was negatively affecting both of our schedules and our academics. I felt like we overindulged and stayed up/slept in too much. So when I first said that I wanted to sleep at my apartment on my own, she broke down and said that I hated her apartment and that I didn’t want to stay there anymore. I tried reassuring her that this wasn’t the case, and that I wanted to stay at my own apartment after it’s been so long and I thought my overall life balance was getting sloppy. I ended up staying at her place again that night. Since then I have tried a couple more times to sleep at my own apartment, even inviting her over to stay with me. But each time I try this, she either has a breakdown or gets really upset and says things like I don’t care about her, or that she feels like a second or third option, or that I always look miserable with her. It has even gotten to the point where she said she wanted to die and I panicked and tried my best to calm her down. I had also proposed sleeping at our own places during the week and sleeping with each other on the weekends but she really didn’t like that idea either.Recently when I was sleeping with her at her place, I had some issues sleeping due to some health conditions. So when I told her I planned on sleeping at my place because I felt like I could treat my health conditions there better, she got upset and said I don’t like to spend time with her.I understand how she can want to spend a lot of time with me because we don’t see each other over break, but I feel like we can still spend a lot of time without sleeping together every night. She’s also worried that we will see each other less after college, but I’ve told her that we can make it work, we still have so much time, and we can eventually sleep with each other every night if we get a place together and/or get married. Overall, it stresses me out knowing I can’t comfortably sleep in my own apartment without making her upset or sad. AITA?TL;DR: I have been staying over at my girlfriend’s apartment for several months, and when I try staying at my apartment she gets upset.",

They told me when I came back from vacation over new years on the 8th (over text) that they didn’t get hired on full time and no longer had a job and doesn’t have rent for January.. I ended up paying my part of rent and begging my landlord to give them more time. They gave an additional 2 weeks to get rent together. I asked my roommate just a few days ago if they almost had rent and they said no, that they will not be paying and supposedly will be moving out next week. They have completely ignored and avoided me all month, so much so that they won’t even have an in person talk with me. I just got the electric bill in and asked them if they are going to pay their part and they have not responded yet. I have already switched the WiFi pw so they can’t use it because it’s not free so I feel it’s only necessary for the power to go next. I have the breaker box in my room behind a locked door. So will I be the asshole of if I cut the power to their room when they inevitably say they will not be paying their part of electric?Ps. It wouldn’t be a big deal but I have a 3 year old and I am already barely making ends meet, electric is 260 this month due to needing the heater and with her not paying rent this puts me in a bind this next month trying to catch up on what she didn’t pay.Edit for clarity: this person has been working door dash since I came back (so they have money) and agreed to pay rent within the additional 2 weeks given. It’s coming down to the wire and now is saying they won’t. I opened my door to them in the beginning and they didn’t pay rent, buy food or any other living necessities for several months, all out of my pocket. At this point I just feel used and all the help I gave is just in the wind because now they are doing me dirty by just bailing.

I told her that, and she looked upset. She said I could have told her while she was making the eggs. I said I was sorry, I forgot.

A lot of people asked for more information about what we actually said and how things transpired: I was in the kitchen and could see she was breaking eggs into the pan, but wasn’t paying attention as we were talking about other things. So I saw she was making eggs but didn’t notice what kind; she didn’t ask me how I’d like them and I also didn’t remember to ask. I only noticed it was sunny side up when we sat down to eat.I said: “oh baby, I forgot you didn’t know, I have a thing with runny eggs”. She didn’t say anything for a second, then grab the plate and went back to the pan. I told her I could do it, but she told me she’d do it. She came back like 1 minute later and I told her thanks.

Right from the time he could talk, my mom started giving him whatever he wanted whenever he threw a tantrum. I put up with it at first, hoping the tantrums would stop, but things just got worse over time.No matter how much I tried to tell my parents, especially my mom, to stop babying him, it felt like they weren't listening. I even suggested she let him learn to eat with a spoon on his own when he was 4, but now, at 8, he still makes a huge mess when he eats – standing up, watching TV, and leaving rice all over the place. My mom complains, but nothing really changes.In 2019, my mom had another baby, my youngest brother, who's now 4. I tried my best to make sure he didn't end up like his older brother – While I wasn't perfect at teaching,  my youngest sibling is way more disciplined. He knows how to eat nicely, say sorry when he messes up, and take care of himself, unlike his older brother who still needs a lot of help.Now, let me tell you about this recent incident. My (8) M brother was building a pillow fort, taking up all the pillows, and I was cool with that – he's still a kid. But my youngest brother just wanted one pillow to lay on while watching something on my phone. I knocked on my bedroom door to grab something, and my brother got mad, saying, \"I’m not letting you in because I’m punishing you.\"Before all that happened, earlier I tried to explain that our youngest brother just wanted to play, but he wouldn't listen. He kept shouting, so I took our youngest brother out of the room. Later, I asked my brother to open the door, promising to take only one pillow. Instead, he threw a huge tantrum, yelling that I was \"destroying it.\" I promised to find another way to get the pillow without ruining his fort, but he kept shouting.Then, my mom showed up without even asking what happened, she started yelling at me to stop. So, I just focused on feeding my youngest brother his dinner that they brought. But instead of figuring out what went down, my mom told me to apologize. I found it ridiculous, and I laughed silently, wondering why I should say sorry when I didn't do anything wrong.My mom got even more upset, shouting, \"Just say you're sorry! How hard is that? Be reasonable.\" Feeling the pressure, I said sorry in a sarcastic way. She wasn't buying it and insisted on a real apology.

Now when it comes to gift giving in our family, we only do it for the children twice a year, birthdays and Christmas. And nothing too expensive either.However, the last few years, my brother and his family have stopped giving gifts to my kids and my sisters kids.  With that being said, my sister and I have continued to give gifts to my brother’s two girls.  Now, if they were short on money or going through a rough time, we would completely understand.  However, my brother and his family either say they forgot and will get something in the future (which they never do) or make the excuse that they didn’t know they were supposed to get a gift.   We’ve even told them that even just a card from the dollar store would mean a lot, however that seems to fall on deaf ears.Also, my brothers two girls never appreciate any of the gifts they get.  Not to mention, the attitude of my brother and his wife doesn’t help the situation either.  Here is what I mean.  If you were to give the two girls a gift, then either it gets completely destroyed, lost or my brother and his wife will throw it away when it’s in perfect good condition.  A gift card or cash?  Gets lost and they don’t care where it is.  Clothes?  My brothers wife refuses to do laundry, the clothes get damaged and then they just throw it away when the girls have maybe worn it once or twice.  Books?  Get ripped and destroyed. Even second hand and homemade gifts are just tossed aside with my brother’s family. I cross-stitch for a hobby and can do lots of different projects.  Christmas stockings, wedding dates, welcome baby ones, the list goes on.  Well they really wanted baby date ones for their two girls and so I obliged and made that for them.   But where are they now?  Sitting in a closet, collecting dust and getting damaged when they keep piling stuff on top of it; which hurts me personally since I put so much work into them. The other members of my family don’t know what to do.  My parents don’t want to stir the pot, cause they know my brothers wife is very touchy and she is the gate keeper to their son. Tick her off and my brother will not speak to you until there’s been an apology to his wife; even if you are in the right and she is wrong.I personally feel like I am just done with it all.

When she did this, she was in decent health and of sound mind.  Signing it over was her idea, not mine.For context,  there's me 48/f then I have 2 brothers 53/m (we'll call him Kyle) and 52/m (we'll call him Dex).  Our dad died years ago and after he died I'm who helped and took care of our mom.   I stayed living with her to help her financially and then with medical issues she had over the years.   I never lived there for free and wasn't a freeloader  I helped her with the mortgage, taxes, upkeep/maintenance.  Plus all the other typical expenses of a home.  I could afford my own house but I couldn't help her and do that too.   I gave up a lot so my mom didn't lose her home and I don't regret it.  Getting married wasn't a priority to me but my living situation was often a deal breaker to men and I also gave up having/adopting kids to help her.  If I had kids I was planning to be a single parent from the start by way of adoption or IVF.Houses age and things need replaced/repaired before my mom died I was already making improvements because well ... it needed to be done.  Since she has died...  I renovated a lot.   I updated the electrical system, the kitchen, 2 bathrooms, put in all knew light fixtures, new doors throughout the house.  Then I redid a lot of the yard too.  All of which I paid for myself.  Essentially, I made it my own home and the way I wanted it.  Some of these things were changes my mom wanted that we had planned to do together.\"Dex\" had no issues with our mom giving me the house.   The house wasn't exactly free, when she died she still had a small mortgage left and I assumed that debt plus well, the house needed a lot of work.   Kyle threw a fit though.   Both of them had their own homes.  Kyle would always talk down about the house because it wasn't in great shape, my mom couldn't afford the repairs and couldn't do them herself.  I did what I could over the years when she was still alive.  He only became interested in house when he found out it was worth more than he thought and he didn't want the house, he wanted the money.  He tried to sue me in court to buy out his \"interest\" in the house but his case was dismissed because the house wasn't an asset of our mom's  when she died.I have since sold this house.  It was valued at $75,000 when she died.   It sold for $235,000 recently so I gave my brother each a third of what the value was ... when she died.  I gave them both a check for $25,000.  Most of the rest I used as a down payment on the house I bought.  Dex was happy with that $25,000.  Kyle is throwing a fit that he says I owe both of them $78,000 each for it to be fair/equal.  Yet I put thousands of dollars into the house of which he contributed exactly $0.00.AITA?",

Lisa is a lesbian btw.Another girl from our group “Diana” also 16 is the most social out of us and she is a part of 2 friends groups. So we kinda merged the groups and started talking all together because a girl from Diana’s group “Allie” (15) started dating Lisa and they kissed a few times.Since I’m bffs with Lisa now she confessed that she and Allie steal from shops. I went to the mall with Lisa and Allie and they stole a pair of jeans and also 2 t shirts. I was uncomfortable with them stealing and also doing PDA and so I excused myself.Turns out most of the girls in both friends groups know that Lisa and Allie steal and some have stolen as well. Like they have a second gc where they would share what they stole and discuss stealing tactics and plans to which shop to go.

However, I had to say no.The reason I declined is because I rely on my car heavily for my daily work commute and errands. I drive a lot for my job throughout the day and need it to get to meetings and appointments. I sometimes even use it for deliveries. Going days without a car would significantly impact my ability to work.My brother was a little annoyed when I declined, but said he understood. I could tell he was hoping I would give him my car keys to use while his is in the shop. He is not saying anything but I can tell he is still a bit annoyed.I feel bad that he's without a vehicle right now, so I offered to help him get a rental car or see if some friends might be able to help drive him during this time. But he waved off those suggestions.Now my parents heard about this and are saying I'm being unreasonable for not just handing my car over to my brother when he's in a bind. For some background: He is the youngest and always was their \"Favourite\" if you will. We have a great relationship, but in situations like this I see my parents lean towards my brother.I want to help, but it's a big ask to lend my primary vehicle for days when I need it myself.AITA in this situation or are my parents? I know my brother's car being stuck in the shop puts him in a tough spot, but I don't think it's fair for everyone to expect me to solve his problem by giving up use of my own car.",

	"body" : "My friend got \"married\". I put the word marriage in quotes because I found out after the fact that there was actually no legal marriage that happened, as his girlfriend apparently didn't believe in legal marriage. They instead had a ?symbolic? marriage to celebrate their commitment to eachother after being together for almost 4 years, but the guests were led to believe that it was a legal marriage. He and his now ex-girlfriend had asked for donations for their honeymoon in lieu of wedding gifts. The 'wedding' happened, and then his girlfriend broke up with him before they even went on their honeymoon. Weeks have now passed, and they never returned any of the guests' donations for their honeymoon fund.  I don't want to rub salt in the wound, and I understand that once a gift is given, it is done; however, this is an unusual circumstance. Am I being an asshole  asking for the money gift back?Edit: Some answers to commenter questions: I donated 200$ as my wedding gift for their honeymoon fund. Yes, there was a wedding party and food was offered (nothing super fancy); though from what I was told, the wedding was paid for by their parents. Many guests, including myself, paid a lot of additional expenses to travel to their wedding to attend (hotel costs, time off of work, gas).",

The charges were dropped due to the lack of evidence. I don’t know if it really took place or not.She also had an accident where she recorded a phone call where the other party shared some sensitive information and she blackmailed them into giving her money or else she would put it online. The other party paid her and there were no charges present. It was a while ago btw and I found out about it by accident.A few days ago I overheard her talking to someone on the phone and bragging about her organized crime connections. Basically saying that she knows a guy who knows a guy who is an enforcer in a gang and can “make someone’s life really complicated”. Joy is a criminal lawyer so naturally she knows an amount of shady people.I talked to her about it because it seemed like she was bragging to intimidate a person she was talking to. I told her that I don’t want police officers coming into our house again. The whole arrest thing was very traumatizing because the police came to our house and took her away in handcuffs and performed a search.She instantly went defensive and said that she didn’t expect me to accuse her of something even the judge ruled out to be false and that it was an asshole move to listen on her conversation. I started apologizing, but she grabbed her keys and coat and left. She came back in the morning and apologized back saying that she overreacted. She is also being very affectionate with me now.

I had dozens of foster siblings over the years as well. My parents have struggled to make time and have the money for all of us. It has meant a lot of sacrificing and mostly on my part. My parents were able to make sure all my younger siblings had at least one activity outside of school to do but they never did that for me. I was forced to play football when I was 5 but by the time I was 7 my parents had started fostering and I was no longer doing that. My siblings all get to do something they like. Cora does dance for example. Some of my other siblings are in music classes.The younger kids were also prioritized with school field trips. So they always got to go while I haven't since I was 6. The last time I asked was when I was about 9 and my parents told me to work for the money to pay. My grandparents found out what they said and gave me the money and my parents took it off me to use for the household. My grandparents were so mad at  them for that.They delayed my tonsil surgery by 2 years because they prioritized 2 foster kids and two of my siblings surgeries over mine.My grandparents saw how much I was getting the short end of everything with my parents and they set up a college fund for me. It's a lot of money and really caught me off guard. My parents know about it but cannot access it. They only know because of a fight with my grandparents over the lack of saving for my future when they have saved something for my siblings. My parents said the money my grandparents saved should be divided equally because $350,000 is a lot to save for one grandchild when you have multiple.That money is still there and I have plans for it. But my youngest sister is 5 and she needs a pretty major stomach surgery. She's had a lot of health troubles since her birth and my parents have paid a lot of money on her medical expenses. They were told this surgery could turn her life around and give her a chance at living with less pain and stomach complications. It could give her a more normal childhood because she can't do a lot. They don't have the money for the surgery and they want me to give them the money to pay for it and for the expenses afterward. They said they need $270,000 for the whole thing and maybe they can give some of it back but they might need even more if stuff gets more complicated. I told them they can't have that money and they lost it and told me I was being selfish and I argued back that they take from me all the time. I asked why they didn't take the money they saved for all my siblings and use that, why does it have to be mine. They said I am putting college before my sister's future and accused me of being unwilling because she's my sister through adoption and not my bio sister.AITA?",

It started off as him ranting to our mother about it and her calling our father a lying manipulative abuser, but that isn’t our father. My father has been nothing but kind and he never puts his hands on us. He also tries to remain calm and quiet, but the most recent incident was when my father shouted at me over something I did (I take full responsibility, it was my fault and I know it was my fault), and P just stopped coming over to his house. Our father misses P and he’s trying his best to try and get P to come over, he gave P space, he gave P time, but now he’s going to take our mother to court for willingly keeping P away from the father, and for parental alienation. Our mother was never a toxic or abusive mother, but she’s been helping P avoid our father and only giving him sob stories about her past. I cannot confirm their history, but I can remember her sitting around a lot. Today I asked P why he chose to stay away, and P said it was abused he didn’t like how our father treated our old dog. The dog was aggressive and attacked our dad. When P saw he was wrong he changed his story to he was mad our dad kept the dog. To be clean due to covid the dog was all he had, and when I pointed out how stupid that was he told me ‘he couldn’t afford to euthanize the dog sooner, but he could buy cigarettes?’ I was shocked after he said that, because he was mad our father was struggling to quit smoking. Something he has done for YEARS. When I pointed out the court might cost mom her nursing license, he told me ‘well he could always not sue’. I think this is going too far but he won’t listen. I called him selfish and now we aren’t talking. AITA?Update- We’re going to family therapy, and hopefully this whole thing can maybe be resolved. I managed to get my stepdad and my biodad to speak to one another, they weren’t on bad terms, just neutral, and that seemed to help.

He, along with my grandma, has been making his wife miserable for giving birth to four daughters, and grandma wants them to divorce so that he can marry another woman.

This is around the time when Elsie started complaining about random harmless things, some of which I hadnt even done.It all started with her saying that I needed to stop closing her door when she had left it open, that it threw her off whenever she came home to the door being closed. I have never done that. I would have no reason to, her door is the last one in that hallway and it's not like it being open gets in the way of anything. I had noticed the door being closed more often, but thought nothing of it. I told her as such but she just rolled her eyes and told me to just stop doing it.The next thing she complained about was me being noisy which, okay, fair, but I've tried to be quieter around the apartment (idk, I took my shoes off to make my steps quieter and have stopped listening to stuff without headphones) and she's still complaining about it. I asked her what else she wanted me to do and she was all \"stop throwing stuff when you're in the kitchen, do it gently\" which.... ?? Dunno what she's talking about there tbh.She's also said that I need to stop leaving wet footprints in the hallway which okay!! I get how that's annoying and have been more careful about it, but she's acting like it hasn't stopped.Her latest wild accusation, and what prompted this post, is that apparently I have taken to stealing her salt. I don't even cook man I don't go near the kitchen except to heat up stuff. Anyways as she was complaining about it I told her she was crazy and that half the things she complained about me doing I didn't even do. It's not my fault if she forgot she closed her door or if she misplaced her salt somehow.IDK I feel like I haven't done anything wrong here but she's clearly very pissed that I said she was crazy mid argument.

Slamming things so hard that our walls shake, bloodcurdling screams and yelling is the only way they communicate, but doesn’t necessarily sound like abuse.

She knows I think so.Yesterday I accidentally told Anya that I started watching a show that we used to jokingly hate together. She laughed and asked why, and I replied that \"I saw a gif on Twitter with an actor from this show and suddenly I had a crush\" I thought it was normal, we often threw photos of actresses/female singers to each other and joked about how hot they were, or just discussed different celebrities.Well, this time Anya became hysterical almost instantly, and she cried the whole night. She said that (I quote) she \"hates my fucking Twitter and my fucking show,\" and that if I was \"still attracted to men,\" then I would leave her \"as soon as I got a new dick.\" She also demanded that I introduce her to my parents, \"because she was tired of dating a woman she didn't know anything about.\" I did not introduce her to her parents, because I grew up in a toxic family and long ago cut off communication with all relatives except my brother.Let me remind you, all this happened because I said THAT I LIKED AN ACTOR FROM A TEEN DRAMA, whom I will never even see.

They got engaged last year and are getting married late spring. My financial situation is extremely precarious right now, and I will be needing to find a place to live before the wedding. As the planning for the bachelorette party started up in secret, my only request was to stay local so I could participate, and the bride had insisted on that as well as she wanted everyone to participate. The plan then changed to a four day trip 10 hours away. I had to decline because I can't afford to be off work for that long (I don't have paid vacation, small business). My friend (soon to be SIL) came to me and explained that she was hurt that I wouldn't be coming, and explained that she felt that I was using my job and general dislike of big parties as an excuse to back out and not go. I attempted to explain the reason without giving away the surprise. I was told the maid of honor would pay for my share if it meant I could go. And I explained that was incredibly kind and thoughtful, but I also cannot afford to be off work 4 days without pay in my current situation. SIL and MoH both still think I'm refusing to go because I don't like parties or being far from home with people I don't know.

Fast forward to the start of this semester and we had a new roommate just show up. I, nor my other two roommates, were made aware of a fourth person moving in. She just showed up.She’s been here for 5 days so far and she’s at the top of my list for worst roommates. She started off with wearing her shoes through the apartment (we’re in the Midwest & it’s covered in snow right now) so she’s tracking in snow and salt all over the apartment and embedding dirt and salt into the carpet. She also keeps shutting the bathroom door after she showers and not leaving the fan on, and our bathroom has already been treated for mold this year (campus housing is fantastic). We have asked her to leave the bathroom door open already. She’s been very loud coming in and out of the apartment at all hours and I have been woken up from her being loud in the middle of the night. The last straw, however, was that I woke up for work Saturday morning to find that there was literal feces on my hand towel in the bathroom from her. I know it was her because she was the only one in the bathroom after I was the previous night. Disgusted, I did not have time to address it before I left for work. When I came home from work, I found that another feces stain was now on the paper towel roll in the kitchen.I made my 2 other roommates aware of this and they agreed that it was disgusting and that we needed to sit her down and discuss with her. Tonight, I got back from classes, only to find that there’s trash on the floor, literally 4 steps away from the trash can. She couldn’t bother to take the extra 4 steps to throw the trash in the correct spot. I’m at my wits end. I made a list of everything that has happened and previous agreements for apartment rules that we had agreed upon prior to her arrival. When presented to her, she stated that I, specifically, am being standoffish towards her and that she does not appreciate it.AITA for addressing these issues and trying to remedy the situation?",

We had 3 days planned there and after half a day she decided that she wanted to just \"chill\" instead of doing all of the stuff we had planned.I couldn't understand given we'd just driven all that way, and spent way more money on fuel and hotels that we would've if we just took a 3 or so hour flight.

	"body" : "I started dating my boyfriend last year in June. He was my coworker back 4 years ago.We started getting close in May, when he started to talk a lot about his work. Since I left, he has been promoted as a manager and has 6 people working for him. He's been complaining that he doesn't have enough resources, and due to budget cuts, he can't hire new team members. After resigning from the company, I've started my own business for 4 years in a different location. We have been negotiating for 4-5 months last year on how we should let our relationship get to the next level. Our final decision was that I would move in with him and shut down my business. In return, he will be paying my living expenses for relocating, giving up my career, and I will take on household chores if I don't get a job.Ok, sorry for the long background story. So last year in June, when he was talking about lacking resources, I asked him what if I went back as an intern? They had difficulty in getting actual headcounts for normal positions, but applying for an intern might be easier. My skills are rusty from the 4 year gap in between, but I'd still be a lot more useful than a real intern, and I can use the opportunity to pick up my skills and fill the gap on my resume.They setup an interview for me, my old boss told me that they would be glad to have me back, but they need some time until the internship opens up.I've moved in with him for 2 weeks by now. Yesterday, one of his team members resigned, he and his boss were discussing how they could borrow some resources from other teams, when his boss said \"and you said that you didn't need the intern opening when I said it was available\". I asked him when he made up his mind that he wouldn't be hiring me even when the position opens up. He replied \"I thought you knew that arrangement would be impossible since we are together now.\"I totally understand that it's difficult to mix work and relationships. He's the manager, I'm 100% aware that he should make the best decision for his team. However, that interview happened after we got together, if he knew that this wasn't a good arrangement, he should've up front told me instead of playing me like that.We had the talk, I've expressed myself, he doesn't think of the situation that way, he thinks that there was just never an event that triggered him to feel that he should say anything to me. For example, he said that if my boss explicitly asked him to notify me that the position had opened up, he would have told my boss to assign me to another manager. But offering him a intern, he did not see as a sufficient event to discuss his change of mind with me.Though feeling a bit played, I decided to swallow it. He is the manager, nobody owes me the honesty, it was never official yet, I don't need this specific job. However, he's either still processing his emotions or trying to give me the silent treatment for telling him that I feel played and thinks I've hurt him. AITA?",

I have worked with her on two shifts. First shift I thought she was fantastic, fresh faced, bubbly and attentive; everything you need in a coworker. Second shift she was shut in the office with the door closed for an hour and 20 minutes after I started my shift. The rest of the shift was her on her phone, quiet, barely talking to clients and staff, moving between the office, lounge rooms and kitchen. She was entirely unapproachable and reserved and did not communicate what she needed if anything. She is also very frequently calling in sick to many shifts - I don’t have an issue with using personal leave, but our industry is very understaffed so finding replacements is difficult; so I now see her as unreliable. Among the rest of the staff we talk about everything, other staff included, everyone talks about everyone; it’s just the way the industry is. We all want to know what everyone else’s experience is with each other so we can aim to work better, and also to know if they are good to the clients. Anyway it got back to her that I was “gossiping” about her, and she took great offence, called our manager crying etc. Keep in mind we all talk about each other.

The only time things were bad was when she asked if I could loan her about $500 and she promised to CashApp me the money back when she got paid next time. I told her no. She tried to argue with me, but I shut her down, and she let it go.A week later I noticed my credit card was missing. I don’t use it very often, usually just for a couple automatic bills. I had logged onto my account online to pay my balance since my check came through that morning, and I saw that my balance was much higher than I had expected. There were three charges I expected, my electric bill and my phone bill and some gas, and then several charges that I knew weren’t from me. They were for fast food, clothing places, etc. I thought it might be a glitch, so I called my CC company and checked my wallet for my card. I realized it was missing, and a nice customer service rep helped me with that whole process, but then I started walking through everyone my wallet had been around and every place it had been left since my last physical use of it.I ended up texting my mom because it was stressing me out and I felt like I needed to talk to one of my parents, but dad and I aren’t on great terms. When I told mom what happened, she told me not to worry and that it wasn’t stolen, she had just borrowed it. To be honest, I did lose my cool once I realized she wasn’t joking. She insisted she’d cashapp me the money when she gets paid the next day, and that she thought she’d be able to handle it before I even noticed. I told her that’s not acceptable and to cut up my card (I deactivated it anyway). She got upset and told me to stop throwing a fit and that she can’t believe I’m being “such a brat” about helping her. Things escalated from there, and I did call her some names before telling her to not contact/come around me and hanging up. After that, I called the police both in my area and in her’s to see which precinct I needed to file charges with.My mom has blown up my phone so much since this that I’ve had to block her, and she is posting all over Facebook about how I’m getting her thrown back in jail just for borrowing some money, and how she can’t understand how she raised such a stingy child.

We have made the decision to spend the rest of our lives together and we spend hours talking about how our lives are going to look like in the future. We usually talk about our finances, housing situation and things that go along after marriage. We have started investing together as well in some SIPs.He is doing well for himself and loves to buy things for himself and those around him. He goes on shopping sprees and spend a good chunk of money, which sometimes I find too much. I have pointed this out to him, and he says it’s okay for me to tell him to stop when he is spending too much on things he doesn’t need.However, one thing that I particularly don’t like is when he spends on other people without thinking. A little background on his family: He has 2 sisters, one of them is married and her husband is well off who does better than my husband. The other sister is unmarried but she has a good job and does well for herself as well.My partner spends on expensive gifts like designer bags, clothes, latest tech gadgets and gives them to his sisters on multiple occasions every 3rd month. Every time they go out (my partner, his sisters and the brother in law) it’s my partner who picks up the tab every time. (I am not sure how adamant they are to pay the bill, but I know that my partner thinks it’s his responsibility to pay). He has even given the unmarried sister his credit card so she can order whatever she can, whenever she wants. The married sister gets these gifts on every occasion. Recently he bought her a very expensive phone on her birthday.In our culture, it’s important for the brother to give gifts and money to the married sister on festivals, birthdays etc but I believe he tends to overboard. I don’t mind the gifts, but I believe that it sets out back financially every time he goes overboard.A little background on me: I have a great job that I enjoy and to get married to him I would have to leave my job and move to a small city with no job prospects, whatsoever. He is doing well for himself and he works really hard but I believe that we need to seriously start saving up for ourselves and our future and spending all that money elsewhere will only set us back in our financial goals.I have tried talking to him but he says  that it’s his responsibility to take care of his sisters and everyone in the family to the best of his abilities. He thinks it is not a big deal but to me it is. I have stopped bringing this up because I don’t want him to think I have an issue with him spending on his sisters but it still bothers me every time.Am I wrong in any way?",

I am planning on taking all of these days and stay home until my son is at least 4.

I suffered a mental health crisis when I was 10, which got me in a hospital. Mom only blames the disorder, so the staff who abused me were allowed to continue. Mom also grounded me for making her miss a day of work because of my \"little attitude\".The big rule at the institution was to  Just Follow Directions™. If no one told me to do a thing, I should never do it until I'm told. If someone makes me uncomfortable, I still needed to just follow their directions. At home, I stopped asking Mom for basic necessities like soap and underwear. I quit showering and doing laundry as that was being a good kid, being out of the way. I eventually smelled horrible, which was blamed on the disorder. Also, when I finally had the courage to ask for new necessities again, Felicia and Arianna would find it so funny that some R Word scum would want something so mature that even they would use. Mom and Patricia found it funny as well, asking why I suddenly want to be so \"fancy\". I finally got back on track with hygiene when I was allowed to shop alone, as I was able to buy anything without judgment, and hide it after I bought it.From late 2018 to mid 2020, Mom treated me much worse than the usual. Much much worse. To this day it's really hard to talk about.In 2021, Mom crossed yet another line, one that I also refuse to write about. I was so offended by how the family treated me that I impulsively changed my whole name without publishing, but a slip-up revealed my name to Felicia and Arianna. They of course found it funny and were belittling towards me. They've treated me this way about my name basically forever.Now, Patricia has terminal cancer and is dying. If a new house is bought, it will be in Felicia's name. Felicia is extremely petty and will force me to comply with her as she owns the house. That's just how she is. I've been working harder since Patricia's cancer diagnosis to avoid this (and it paid off!).Is it justified to leave them with nothing or should I forgive them?",

	"body" : "Obligatory on mobile so sorry for any mistakes.I (27, F) met my friend, I will call her Aurora (21, F), at work. We hit it off quickly and became close friends. We ended up getting matching tattoos and introduced our friends to each other.Aurora was big on drinking and going out, whereas I’m an introvert and prefer to stay home. She went to a Halloween party last year and ended up hooking up with our mutual friend’s ex-girlfriend. I told her I didn’t like that but she said it was fine, our mutual friend didn’t care. I still told her I wasn’t interested in hearing about their sex life and ended up distancing myself a little.Fast forward maybe a month, Aurora and I were at work one day and I mentioned to her that we don’t hang out anymore. She told me to invite her places and I told her I don’t even go anywhere, she’s the outgoing one and to invite me places. That night, my other friend I will call Stanley (39, M) told me that Aurora asked him to hang out. I said to him “she can invite you to hang out but I literally told her today that we don’t hang out anymore”, he ended up leaving her on read.It’s now January, and her birthday was coming up. Stanley asked me if Aurora invited me to her birthday party, I told him no she didn’t. He said she invited him and his girlfriend, I ranted to him because she’s supposedly my best friend and he agreed that she can be very immature. Aurora and I usually donate blood together and we went on a Friday, the day before her birthday. She kept mentioning she was only donating blood because she wanted to get super drunk for her birthday and get so f**ked up on dr*gs. I asked her what she was doing and she only said getting really drunk for it.On her birthday I texted her happy birthday, she only said thankyou. Not even a pity invite. The next working day we had together, it was a Wednesday, she spoke to me like nothing happened and started going on about how much fun she had and how much great s*x she had. I just made small talk about that then only spoke to her about work. Our co-worker asked her why I wasn’t invited and Aurora said “I only invited people I wanted there, so mind your own business”. She has since been fired from work (took too many sick days off), and texted me that she was looking for another job already and she was sorry for “sucking” and that she loved me. We would always say that platonically. I left her on read.5 days later, I get this text message: “I don’t know if we’re ok, I’m sorry for fucking up. I didn’t know it would affect you in any way and I should’ve taken it more seriously. Hope you’re doing well” I again left her on read.Am I the asshole for being upset over this? AITA for ignoring her and not saying why? Sorry for long post.TLDR: “best friend” didn’t invite me to her birthday and told someone she only invited who she wanted there. AITA for being upset?",

I tell him of course not and to shut the fuck up because every time she is clumsy he assumes I did something to hurt her. Which to me is ridiculous. I pick up my toddler and we go into the bedroom to play.

I tell him that is unreasonable, she is a toddler and they are not coordinated yet, I can't control her every move. He asks why I'm mad and I start explaining that a reasonable response to her falling would be \"is she okay\" not assuming your wife did something to hurt your toddler. He cuts me off mid sentence and says \"please stop talking to me\" which makes me more mad. I gather her and my stuff and we leave to the living room. He asks why I am leaving the room and I told him why would I want to be in a room with a man who asked me to not talk. He says \"I didn't say for you to not talk, I asked you to stop talking to me.

The rest of the night he acts like nothing happened and said I am an AH for not wanting to cuddle and hang out with him.

	"body" : "I was at a kickback with some of my close friends 2 days ago. At the end of the kickback my friend (I’ll call her J) asked for a ride home as her original ride had to leave early. I was totally okay with this, but I was worried about her being in my car.I have a very bad fear of bugs. Because of that, I bug bomb my car every season (every 3 ish months), fill it with mothballs, spray every inner/outer inch with Ortho max and use a chlorine diffuser placed on the dashboard. I understand that my car is a gas chamber on wheels, but my reasoning is that it’s better to cut my life by 3-5 years compared 50 years in a deadly car accident. (I almost killed my myself multiple times endangering myself and others due to bugs in my car). Doing all this seemed to stop all bugs from appearing, I haven’t seen them for 2+ year so I do this religiously.so I let J know beforehand if she is okay with all this. Warning J all the things I did to the car and even letting her “testing” the inside of the car if she is ok with it. She said it’s all good. We also made the agreement that she won’t roll down her windows. She told me that’s fine, as the ride home is only about 15 minutes.As we were otw, J mentions that the smell is worse than she thought of, and asked if she could roll down the passenger window. I told her sorry but no, and brought up that we agreed to have the windows up. About a minute later, she just rolled the windows down. I panicked and rolled it back up. Then she started telling me that she’s getting dizzy. Now this is where I feel like a real asshole. I think I slightly gave in and rolled it down about 2mm of space. It was sunny outside, and I was afraid of potential bugs coming in.I dropped her off and J called me a weirdo psycho. I understand that this is not normal, but when choosing between a friend vs phobia, my mind automatically goes to my phobia. I absolutely despise my fear.As I am writing this down I definitely feel like an asshole. What do you guys think?Edit: I guessed it but majority votes AH. Going to apologize to J today. Some of you mentioned that this could have been all avoidable if I just didn’t let J in the car in the first place. I think from now on no more passengers for their own sake",

	"title" : "AITA for Asking FIL to Tell Us When He is Coming Over",
	"body" : "Alright Reddit, so I (32m) just had this argument with my wife (31f), the relevant backstory is that my FIL just got back from over 6 months out of town. Before he left he parked his van at our house, and now that he’s back he is wanting to come get it. He NEVER tells us when he’s coming over, always just pops by. It’s frustrating because he often interrupts our plans for the day and now that we have a baby (0m), its rare that we are just chilling at home with nothing to do, we are pretty much always doing something.So FIL calls my wife, she misses the call and goes “he’s probably calling to figure out when he can pick the van up” so we discuss and decide that we will walk the dog then go pick him up to get his van. Literally 5 minutes after calling (he lives 20 minutes away) he is knocking on the door. I was annoyed because we were trying to do other stuff. When he comes in I say hi, then go “man it’s a good thing we were here, you gotta give us more of a heads up when you’re coming over” he says “well I tried calling but she didn’t answer” and I said “yea you were already on your way though right? What about letting us know before you’re on your way” the whole exchange it was pretty clear he didn’t think he did anything wrong and he didn’t seem offended by my comment. We got the van sorted and (I thought) everything was fine.Now wife is PISSED at me because she says my “jab” was too direct. She says it was her first time seeing her dad in 6 months and I basically said “why tf are you here.” I just know my wife isn’t ever going to say anything, so even though I don’t think he will ever respect boundaries, I think someone still needs to communicate the boundaries with him. I told her that her lack of communication with her dad is going to blow up in our faces eventually, and I’m just trying to protect us from that. He loves just stopping by and my wife doesn’t wanna tell him that his ex wife (messy divorce) is our babysitter for the time being and says if he comes over while she’s here then oh well. But that’s still going to be my wife’s problem when it happens, and she isn’t going to be thinking “oh well” when it does. Shouldn’t she at least try to communicate with him before the shit show occurs? You gotta participate in your own rescue right? I realize my comment was direct, but anything less than a direct statement will be ignored, actually even my direct statement was ignored.I know parent relationships are complex, and generally I let her make the calls with her parents and I take lead with mine, but this is going to be a true issue going forward and I really think I’m just trying to nip it in the bud. FWIW, no other parent just comes by without telling us ahead of time.AITA?Edit: I’ll accept I’m TA here. For the record though, yea he’s been gone 6 months but for the other 4.5 years we’ve been living here it is a weekly occurrence. It bothers my wife but she doesn’t say anything, that’s why I thought I should. I’m not on some power trip lol",

This includes who she wants to hold her, cuddle her kiss her etc. I have shown her this boundary for so long that she also feels comfortable saying to me if she doesn't want to be touched and I respect it. Now here is where I may be the AH. My MIL had my daughter for the first time this weekend so my partner (her son) and I could go on a date and have some romance, everything went great and my daughter had an amazing time with the in-laws. Fast forward to collecting my daughter and us leaving MIL's house and she picked my daughter up and was smothering her with kisses, this would usually be okay but my daughter was saying no and asking to be put down, however MIL wasn't listening to her so I raised my voice to MIL to tell her to put my daughter down as she's not very comfortable with being kissed.This has now caused tension with me and my MIL as although I apologised for the tone I used, I was then blamed for ruining my MIL's day with my daughter and her saying...\" you did upset me, and spolit my day really.... and i had a lovely day with daughter.

After leaving her house I spoke to my partner about my tone and he agreed that I was harsh so I texted her an apology straight away;Hey just wanted to apologise for my tone earlier when DAUGHTER said no to kisses. I've taught her the boundary from a young age if she doesn't want to be touched to say no. If I see her saying no and being uncomfortable then I will advocate for her.

She fully loafs of my parents, who convince themselves that they are supporting her so that she can \"get better\". She's been in and out of drug use since she was 13. She started doing opiates during her freshman year because she thought it was cool. Aside from my parent's divorce, we did not have major hardships in our lives. Our parents and grandparents supported us emotionally and financially. So I find it hard to sympathise with her addictions, which I think she is responsible for creating for herself.  A few years ago, her boyfriend (who she met in rehab and moved in with 2 months later) overdosed and died which obviously impacted her behavior (though she was already on a terrible trajectory). She's constantly  making her problems everyone else's problems. Every year or so, she has a major meltdown and overloading/dumps her issues onto my mother. I've witnessed her ruin my mom's life, peace and mind for the last 10 years and I truly resent her for it. Yesterday, her boyfriend broke up with her and thus begins her first meltdown of the year.My mom is begging me to contact my sister and try to help in some way. I think what my mom really wants is for some of the responsibility of having to listen to my sister constantly be given to someone else. She is sick of always being the one to deal with it and I don't blame her. But I really don't want to speak to her. At this point, I feel only very negatively about my sister. She has no problem dragging everybody else down to her level of constant misery. I have \"been there\" for her many times and it does nothing but drag me down. I'm sure she was terrible to be in a relationship with, and so, I think good for her boyfriend for ending things with her... She also regularly complained about him anyway and how sick of him she is, how she could never tell him she loved him, etc. How can I tell my mom that I love her and want to support her, but that I am no longer willing to take on my sister's problems when refuses to do anything for herself.

We only live near my in-laws, who i genuinely love, so I didnt think it be hard to set boundaries. Now with that's said we've come to a disagreement with the new baby on the way.Well last night my MIL sends me a video about the new RSV shot that's being given to pregnant women to help combat RSV for infants. I said on top of getting the shot we had decided that we didn't want anyone kissing our daughter for the first couple months as just another precaution. Now I'll admit my husband had not officially sided with me on this topic yet and I know I was wrong for making it an us thing but at the time I felt it best to try to seem united on it. My MIL then messaged me saying that people are going to kiss her, especially family and there's no way she's going to not kiss her. If she had just said she doesn't understand why I would hold them to that or would like to talk about it and maybe ease my concerns I wouldn't have been so mad off the bat but she told me that I had no choice in how this was going down with my child and it's not the first time she's done this since I got pregnant.My MIL called my husband after I didn't respond to her texts and was then getting into us about how she's raised three boys and that my concerns as a first time mom are just overdramatic and I can't put her in a bubble for about 45 minutes. She said how I'm going to have to just learn to be more comfortable with things that make me uncomfortable and that she was put in her place many of times when she had my husband,her first child. I said this was not something I was willing to budge on and that right now were just going to disagree because I had given my family the same rules about their trip when they come to visit and they all agreed and understood. She did not care.Once off the phone my husband and I ended up in an argument because I was extremely hurt by how she had claimed what I was trying to do was hurtful to her and that if I tried to play games and keep the baby from them I was wrong. He was annoyed because he doesn't see why it's that big of a deal to let them kiss her since they both work from home. I told him if it was just them in the house I would honestly be fine with it but they have his brothers16 and 21 who are both in and out of the house for various reasons. He feels like I'm making an issue with hsi family for no reason. Later we both apologized for getting so mad at each other before I explained my feelings of being disrespected, and said that was where my main issue came in and he just kind of nodded it off.

I at this point was crying my eyes outs my room is the only place that I have control over, she had gone through all of my personal belongings such as my diary, vapes and cigarettes all of which she knew about previously.I had to call her when I did I screamed at her calling her sick for taking everything out of my room in her words 'if its not gone by the morning(atm it was 10pm) I'll just burn it'. I was not okay like wtf it had all of my school work in from the last 6 years which would take me years to make up for. ill shorten the next bit for convenience, I moved things to my car and the next day I went to my best-friends house.However, my sister was in on it too she (19F) I was close with and came to my room in the night and screamed at me calling me ungrateful and how full of myself I was to even think I would cry over that all my things had been taken for my room.AITA for being ungrateful for my mother 'cleaning my room'",

I live with my parents since my mom isn't mentally competent and they need help looking after her. Janet lives with her boyfriend and they'd planned on coming over on Sunday afternoon.So, I take up work on assignment basis and can pick the assignments based on the dates I have free. I do have to be away from home overnight for the duration of these assignments. Each assignment pays differently and since it isn't like conventional steady, guaranteed work, I need as many assignments as I can get. Initially I had left the weekend of her birthday free so we could all spend time together but I got a really good assignment at the last minute with possibility of bigger future assignments. I took it after much deliberation and it weights heavily on me.I video called Janet at 12AM and wished her, we talked a bit and she got on another call. We decided to do breakfast together near my work place so we'd all at least do something together. The day of her birthday, no one showed up. No one answered my calls. So I assumed they decided to cancel. I tried their phone again in the evening and it turns out they were on their way to meet me. We met up for maybe 5mins. They'd also cut the cake without video calling me (which we always do in case any of us is away). I didn't say anything because it was my fault that I wasn't there on her day. But I feel terrible for what they did too. AITA?",

	"body" : "My fiance and I (both 19, non-binary) got engaged on Thanksgiving 2023 after only being together for a few months. We made the decision to wait to tell our families until Christmas 2023 as a dun Christmas surprise.When we went to see my mom, I was prepared for her to say something about it because she thinks we are rushing into things too quickly and she is a bit of a helicopter mom. When we told her, her reaction was exactly that. She did say she was happy for us but told us we should hold off on the wedding for a couple years (i.e. 2026 or later) to make sure we want to get married. We both just brushed it off and our plan is still to get married in October of 2024.We told the rest of my close family/friends and so far everyone else has been really happy for us besides my grandmother (mom's mom). My grandma reacted the same way as my mom but has told us multiple times that she is happy for us and has welcomed my fiance with open arms so I'm not too worried.Currently the problem is that every time I even mention the wedding (and sometimes when I don't) my mom has to bring up that we should wait to get married. She doesn't even listen to me when I tell her that my fiance is the love of my life/soulmate and neither my fiance or I can think of a way that we wouldn't be together.It got to the point where I was physically sick with emotion because one of the things I dreamed about was going to wedding boutiques and doing wedding stuff with my mom. Like that's what mom's usually do when their child is getting married. I also have distanced myself from really doing anything to plan for the wedding which my fiance understands but we are on a bit of a time crunch so we are a bit behind on things.I am to the point where I am currently ignoring calls/texts from my mom because I don't want to hear her thoughts about the wedding. I have also decided to tell her that if she doesn’t want to support my fiance and I getting married and will just keep commenting on it that she will be uninvited from the wedding and I don't really want her to be apart of my life anymore.AITA for deciding to tell my mom this?Edit: I forgot to add that I don't have a very strong relationship with my mom because she doesn't understand that I'm non-binary and that I don't like guys.Edit 2: I read a lot of comments about concern for marrying young and that a parent should be worried about their child marrying young. I guess part of my family (my dad's side, including myself) is used to it because a lot of the family married young on that side. I did ask my dad what he thought about it and he said as long as we have the money to pay for wedding costs go for it but if we don't then we should wait. Also, for clarification, my fiance will be 20 by the day of the wedding and I turn 20 about a month after the wedding.",

About a month and a half into the split I decided I needed to get rid of everything he gave me or that reminded me of him which included loads of pictures (however he has copies of most of not all of them), some clothes (hoodies and t-shirts mostly) and heartbreakingly my stuffed whale. I didn’t want to just throw it out so I took it to a local kids group home.I had a really bad health scare a few months ago and my mom reached out to him. He visited me in the hospital and reconciled and got back together and are currently in couples therapy.A week ago he asked where she was and when I explained I donated her he got really upset. She meant a lot to both of us, and it really hurt me to give her up. But he’s been a bit distant and cold ever since.

I’m incredibly lucky and greatful for this and I don’t hide that’s how I was able to buy.My bf 27m of 8 months, just bought his first home, I’m very happy for him. However he likes to tell people he did it without any help and saved up all by himself. This it’s technically true, he did save the money by himself, but he also got help in that his parents let him live at home rent free and food free for years so he could save. He was able to save £30k in 2 years because of this!He was having some friends round (not a housewarming) and bragging about how he saved up all by himself and ‘didn’t just get a handout like some people’ whilst also looking at me. I was really shocked by this as, due to the housing market right now, everyone I know has had some help from family in order to buy homes, even those in couples.I basically said back what I said in the title and pointed out he lived at home rent free for years, so he did get help from his parents. One of his friends agreed with me, my bf got angry and the night ended shortly after. Once everyone left he told me I was an asshole and embarrassed him infront of his friends.So am I TA for this?Edit to address things that keep coming up: Yes he was deliberately looking at me when he made the comment, everyone could tell.He paid for nothing whilst living at home, no rent, no contribution to gas and electric, no council tax, he did not pay for food. He bought himself a newer car because he didn’t like the family one he was able to use.He bought at the end of November, housewarming was in December. This was not the first time he had made comments like that but the first time he had intentionally looked at me whilst making them.Edit: SpellingAfter university I house shared and rented for 5 years, I saved some money but nowhere near enough to buy because of the cost of renting. I said in comments and will say again I wouldn’t have my home if not for my grandma because of the housing situation in the UK right now.And to the person who said I let my grandmother die so I could have her money.

My dad and his older sister raised me until my aunt married when I was 9 and then it was just me and my dad.A few months ago I was contacted by my mom. She was sick and dying and wanted to see me. I was kinda curious for my other family and went to meet her. My mom married and had another daughter Mindy (17) and a son (13). Her two siblings were also there when I visited her. I want to say it was an emotional reunion but I seriously don’t know this woman and she was pale and weak on her bed so other than some sympathy and pity I didn’t feel much for her.Everyone else left except her nurse. We talked and updated each other about our lives. She did fine for herself and I’m in a good school so nothing much to worry about. Before I left, she gave me a gold and diamond bracelet saying it was my grandmother’s and made her nurse act as a witness. I took it. Her nurse then said she needed to rest and I left her side. I didn’t really talk much with mom’s new family or my aunt and uncle because they didn’t seem to want to talk to me. So I kinda nodded at them and left.My mom passed a month ago. I attended the funeral along with my dad. I wore the bracelet and at least a few family members saw it. My mom’s sister contacted me a week ago, saying the bracelet should be Mindy’s as it was supposed to pass from oldest daughter to oldest daughter in our family. She said I have not been part of the family until like a month ago and I didn’t deserve the bracelet.I told her that my mom gave it to me with the nurse as a witness and the bracelet is mine. I said if they want it so bad I am willing to sell it to them. She called me a selfish AH and said the bracelet carries a lot of sentimental value for the family and I only saw money. She also said my mom was sick and incapable of making any logical decisions and I took advantage of her unwell state when I just accepted the bracelet. She said I was robbing Mindy of a chance to carry on the tradition and that she loves the bracelet and I just stole it from her.Again, I said they could buy it from me at a reasonable price.

I’ve struggled this last year, because mum duties have taken over work stuff. I’ve really had to wreck my business to keep my head above water with caring for the kids.My husband has always been a bit of a workaholic, but is currently getting really stressed with the pressure of earning enough money. We both run our own businesses. I’m keen to get my work back on track and stop him having to work so many hours, but that would entail him being able to commit to an afternoon of childcare a week and he won’t because he admits he would prioritise work if something went wrong, which would leave me having to cancel clients at the last minute.There is a three day conference coming up that I really want to go to. I’ve wanted to go for years, but it just hasn’t been possible. I initially asked in the family chat (his side of the family) if they felt between them they could cover three days. Everyone said yes.Then my husband found out that the event allows families to attend. Not the lectures etc. but to be on site. He wants to do that. I know partially so he can have a little holiday and spend time with the kids, but he admits also so he doesn’t have to do bedtime alone. He has never had all three alone for more than an hour or so. Not even sure he’s had the older two for a whole day without getting his parents to help.If he comes with, he’ll have three full days of childcare alone, but I’ll be there for bedtimes (though that will probably mean missing the social stuff in the evenings as bedtime might be prolonged away from home). If he stays home, he can have help any of the days and potentially the evenings too. Downside of staying home is that my parents may try to take over, which he rightly hates.Probably selfishly; I want a break. I have the full mental load with the kids. I’m trying to work and run a household. I’m hugely lucky we have my in-laws close. My parents are trickier, but they live with us and can be helpful. We can afford nursery one day a week. Any child free hours are spent either desperately trying to catch up on work or household stuff. A three day conference on my own sounds like bliss.WIBTA if I say I want to go alone?ETA: I think I’ve made him sound less competent than he is. He regularly has 1 or 2 of the kids for up to half a day. Just not all three. He used to do bedtime for the older two, but when I went back to doing some evenings after the 3rd was born, trying to do bedtime with a breastfed baby was too much. I dropped my evening work and it’s just become habit for me to do bedtime most of the time. He comes up if he’s back in time.UPDATE: I told him I’m booking it just for me, because I would have to miss out on the evening parts of the conference and because he would get more help at home. He immediately got angry, but I didn’t back down. As expected he threatened to work two of the days. I’ll organise his parents to have them both those days and overnight. If he changes his mind about working at least I know I’ve got them covered.",

In mid July I met my then boyfriend Tommy, 19, male we dated on and off until the end of august and called it quits as the relationship was extremely toxic. I would tell Sara all of the problems Tommy and I were having in our relationship and she would support me saying i should leave him and he didn’t deserve me. After leaving the relationship Tommy and I stayed friends and in the middle of october we ended up meeting up with a group of friends including Sara and reconsidering the end of our relationship. At the beginning of the relationship everything was going smoothly Sara was with her new Boyfriend, a good friend of the group, named Ryan, 19, male and Tommy and my relationship seemed to move in a positive direction after getting back together. In mid November Sara and Ryan broke up and this is when Tommy and I started to get distant. I noticed that after Sara and Ryan’s relationship ended Tommy spent more time talking to her and grew more distant from me, i just figured he was being a good friend as they insisted they had no physical attraction to each other and their friendship was completely platonic. So, one night Tommy was with his friends and I called to see what time he was gonna get home. I was shocked when his friends asked if I knew about the texts Sara had been sending Tommy. I was shocked and confronted Tommy immediately and asked if he had been cheating on me with Sara. He denied this several times saying that the messages were only one sided. I texted Sara and she told me a completely different story. At this point I didn’t know who to believe and so i chose to trust Tommy. Later that week I went on vacation with my family and while I was on my trip I got a message sent to me of a screen shot texts to Sara from my boyfriend about the cheating and him trying to disguise it. I was disgusted and broke up with Tommy immediately and told Sara that I shouldn’t have assumed it was one sided. This is where I maybe the assh*le. My friends are saying i should forgive her as it was entirely her fault and my boyfriend should’ve stayed loyal in the first place. But Sara and Tommy are now dating and I don’t know if I can find it within me to forgive them let alone stay friends with them.

One day she met a guy and they hit it off. Not even a week into knowing this guy she asked me if she could bring him over. My husband and I weren’t comfortable with this especially since she’s known him for less than a week and we both worked from home and we didn’t want a stranger in our home and she understood. She mentioned when they first started hanging out that he told her he was dropping this other girl he was talking to because he liked her more and that gave her an ego boost. I asked her how she would feel if she was that other chick but she said “I’m not her so sucks for her”. After a couple of weeks of hooking up he ghosted her and she was upset but decided to put her time into getting a job.She thrived off of male attention- during the next few months, she would try and get a random guys number (even if she didn’t think he was cute or anything) just to see if she can. She would always do stuff like this.A few months into her living with us- I had an idea that we should start a podcast because we would talk about the most random stuff. She was down so we started to come up with all the logistics.We created a shared note so we can add things as we went about our days.One morning I see that she had made an edit a few days prior. I go to see what she added and I see this question written by her to ask me on the podcast: “have you ever felt threatened by me to steal [your husband]?” I was shook when I read this. After all the years we have been best friends we have never run into any problems like this or ever asked each other a type of question like this. I showed it to my husband and he was also shook. My husband and friend have only ever been friends and he was comfortable enough to let her live here but there has never been any thought of them being a thing so I know this was strictly an ego boost question to see if she could try and steal my man. When she got home from work I confronted her about it and she wasn’t very apologetic or thought she was in the wrong and had said “sorry you’re overthinking”, as if I didn’t have a good reason to be upset at it. I asked her to move out.A couple months go by and we meet up for a drink. I asked her if she felt any different about the situation and if she understood why I did what I did. She said she didn’t feel bad about it and thought I overreacted. She continued to tell me about her life and how she went to a male strip club and asked a stripper for his # and asked if she had to pay for S** and that she found a new boyfriend and she thinks he’s the one. I saw no change in her.AITA for kicking her out?",

	"body" : "6 years ago my brother met his girlfriend, let's call her Camilla. She seemed really nice at first, but as the years went by, things turned for the worse.Over the years they became cheaper with presents, mainly towards me, despite working full time. At first it would start out as me being told my bithday or christmas present hadn't arrived in the mail, just for me to discover they bought it weeks later. Then they began to give presents that had clearly been opened or used prior to me getting them.At first I kind of ignored it, because I didn't want to make a fuss about getting a disapointing present. However, last christmas really takes the cake. I wasn't celebrating christmas with my brother and Camilla, so I assumed we would hand out presents for each other next time we would see each other.That seemed to be the case for the rest of my family, but then my brother gave a strict order to both me AND my mom, that I would need to open his and Camilla's present on christmas day. I didn't really question it, so it went in the pile with the rest of the presents.When I opened it it consisted of a piece of paper wrapped around an empty toiletpaper roll. On the paper was written, that my brother and Camilla had decided to give me 150$ for a trip I am going on this summer. No money was included in the package, and I know that for sure because three people inspected it just to make sure.I then decided to ask him the following day if it was on Paypal or when I would get the money, because I thought maybe they would wait until payday. They have done that before, so I didn't think much of it first.My whole family was there when I asked him when the money would be given to me, and Camillas face immediately turned stiff and pale. My brother said that the money should have been in the packaging, but I said it was nowhere there. He then couldn't pinpoint where he had put the money - if it was in the wrapping paper, inside the folded piece of paper or inside the toiletpaper roll. All this time Camilla said nothing and just starred in the opposite direction. He said I must have thrown it away by accident, when I insisted on not having seen it.I was pissed afterwards that the brother I always loved had tried to gaslight me on christmas day by trying to convince me I had thrown away 150$ dollars. I suspect that Camilla had a huge part to play, as she seems to dislike me a lot and has been progressively colder towards me in the past couple of years. But I can't help to dislike my brother because of it too, as I just can't see why one could do such a thing to their own little sister - even when pressured into it.I've always bought nice present for them and their daughter, but I don't think I will be buying anything for my brother and Camilla from now on. Am I the ahole for not wanting to buy presents for my own brother because of this, even if he is being manipulated by Camilla?",

First, the teacher simply said we must pick a non-fiction book to base our assignment on. I only live near one library. My mom went to that one and got me a biography, as the workers literally said those were the only non-fiction books available. I brought it in, only for the teacher to then say \"no biographies\". I was luckily able to lie to my teacher about my topic, and she didn't even bother to check. Sadly, another kid who also had a biography got detention as the teacher was able to see he had a biography. We also have a school library but she said that for this assignment we aren't allowed to use any non-fiction books from there.I didn't have any other choice but to use this old computer at my house to use the Internet for information about the topic I said. Nobody else could have the same topic as each other. The rubric mentioned nothing about citations as it was presumed that only the book would be used for information.She also made a rule that she wouldn't take any points off for having photos sticking out of the board. I had been relieved about this. However, everyone else got their essays back, while she kept mine back. Even kids who handed in their essays late and got marks off for it got their essays back before mine. I raised my hand to try to bring this to her attention, but she just gave me a look and turned away. The students were waiting to ask the teacher questions, so I stood with them. When it was my turn, I said \"Hello\" and then she asked in an irritated voice \"What do you want?\" I then politely pointed out that I didn't get my essay back. She then said in an irritated voice \"Can you wait?\" Then, she called me in for a meeting after class about my essay. I felt nervous and tried not to cry, but my eyes were watery. She then screamed at me, asking me \"What is this behavior? Stop this behavior now!\" cause she saw the water in my eyes. I then said, \"yes m'am\".She began to rant, asking \"What is this?\" then she proceeded to compare my work with my peers work who did better work and talked about their work. She then proceeded to mock me, as at the beginning of the year everyone had to have a goal for themselves and share it and mine was to make the honor roll. She proceeded to laugh in my face and I cried. She started commenting on how hysterical I was.I then had to present my work to my class the next day. I was so anxious that I cried during lunch and begged mom to let me stay home but she said I had to go :(.When the teacher was confronted by mom, the teacher (known to lie to parents and act sweet in front of them) said that I was upset because I didn't get 100% on the assignment (not true) so mom started saying \"well you can't get 100 all the time sweetie it's unrealistic\".

Sarah and I began talking on Instagram about nine months before college, snapping and face timing often - we became good friends. She made many promises about going out, doing stuff together, and having each other's backs. When we got to college, things started to take a turn. We went out together a total of 3 times before I decided she was a massive red flag. At each party we went to, she ditched me for a boy, and I was stuck walking home by myself, drunk and in a town I was still unfamiliar with. I often tried to do more casual things with her, like offering to work out, go for coffee, or study. The very few times we did those things, it was often awkward, her passive-aggressive remarks and my general feeling of discomfort around her. She started to make excuses and hang out with her other friends. I was always lovely, initiating conversations with her friends when they came over, but she was always putting on a show in front of them, being rude or ignoring me. Then, when the door shut, she was a fake version of excellent, pretending like she wanted to be close. Flash forward, I established friends outside of my disappointments with my roommate. Sarah and I only really talked in the room and had our friends. But, when I had my birthday at college, I still invited her to my birthday as it was the correct thing to do. A couple of weeks later, I had to find out from a mutual girlfriend, whom I had introduced to Sarah, that Sarah was having a big birthday dinner and invited all her girlfriends, including three girls I introduced her to - but not me. I knew I could either blow this up or remain mature. I stayed out of the dorm and at my boyfriend's place the night of the party. When I returned (the girls all went to the frats after her party), there were about 30 solo cups all over the floor (right near my space) and a nauseating stench of alcohol in the dorm. I cleaned it all up and decided not to confront her but distance myself because her not inviting me told me where we stood.Over winter break, she only snapped at me and never texted, and I was the one who had to say \"Merry Christmas\" and \"Happy New Year!\" Since we've returned from break, we've probably spoken about ten words to each other - all surface-level conversations. I want to move out so bad; being in the room with her makes me anxious, and I have much more positive girlfriends I would rather live with. I don't wanna deal with her anymore.",

	"body" : "I live 2000 miles away from my lifelong best friend Hannah (both 26f) and have for the last three years.Hannah was in a pretty long but not quite committed situationship with someone who was here on a long term work visa. I don’t know  much about how all the immigration laws work exactly so I won’t try to explain but the gist of it is that his visa was tied to his job and he got laid off not long ago. He left for his home country right after new years. He should be eligible to return but it’ll be a fairly lengthy process and he’s unlikely to return in the next year or possibly even two.Hannah is devastated. She was in love with him  and i feel terrible for how much hurt she feels right now. I love her and i do want to be there for her. She doesn’t have a lot of in person support in her life right now. But the support she needs is several hours long FaceTime calls multiple times throughout the week. And it’s been a lot.We’re in different time zones so FaceTimes me around 6pm (my time) and I’m on the phone with her until 9 or 10. She’s a bartender who doesn’t have early mornings while I have to be in the office by 7am and I like to go down to the gym before I get ready so I’m up around 4:30 every day. On top of conflicting schedules, I have a bit of a long bedtime routine.After a few calls, I realized that in order to get enough sleep I would either have to cut Hannah short or start getting ready for bed on the phone with her. She was still in a bad place so I went with the second option - doing my skincare, braiding my hair and brushing my teeth while she was talking. I could hear/see her just fine and I could still talk except when brushing my teeth but it’s like 3 minutes out of 180 so I thought that was a pretty good ratio.It was much better for me because I could basically hang up and roll over to go to sleep and I wasn’t so tired. But the next call, I brought the phone into the bathroom with me to start washing my face and Hannah said that she didn’t like it and it felt like I wasn’t listening to her or that she was bothering me. I said neither of those things is true but I needed to maintain my life too. She seemed bothered and cut the call short. I can’t say I wasn’t relievedShe sent me a text saying “it’s rude and it hurts my feelings. Why can’t you just acknowledge that?” I haven’t responded yet because I don’t know what to say. She did make me feel bad but I also feel annoyed because as much as I love her, I just don’t have 15+ hours a week I can dedicate solely to FaceTiming with her. But I know she’s very sensitive right now and maybe I’ve been inconsiderate by not focusing on her when she needs me. Also… it might just be considered generally rude, I’m not really sure.

	"body" : "Me(18F) & my older brother(26M) argue constantly over small disagreements, it usually stems from him trying to “parent me” in some sense. We both live under my fathers roof & it was agreed that once we finish school we pay rent or move out. I haven’t finished school yet & I'm planning to go to college as well. My brother has been finished school for a while now &  he is jobless at the moment. He has his own family & my father told him and his gf(24) that he could live with us until he got his feet planted on the ground which is pretty understandable cuz he became a father at 21. The issue is that he has had his feet on the ground for a very long time & he had a position that payed very well & he made it clear to me the other day that he “has enough money to start a business” so it made question why he has the money for that but not the money to afford a mortgage. It’s no shocker he has money saved up because he doesn’t pay my father rent & neither does his gf. They live in the basement, 1 of the bedrooms was turned into a gaming room, my brother's bedroom was turned into their kids room & the guest bedroom is being used by my brother's girlfriend's sister(who also doesn’t pay rent) & then they turned the living room into their bedroom. So there’s not even enough rooms for all of them living down there. They leave messes in the kitchen & expect me to clean up after it. If I leave a plate or 2 in the sink he yells at me to clean it up but that means I have to clean their dishes so I've refused to clean them up a couple times. My father works week on week off & the house usually gets a big clean up before he’s home but they expect me to clean up all of upstairs even though i’m pretty much confined to my room everyday, i eat my meals in my room, i clean my messes up in the kitchen & so on. You might as well call me Cinderella at this point because all I do is clean up after everybody else. I love my brother & his family don’t get me wrong but it's unfair on me, i can’t have the kitchen between 5-7pm every night, if i want to clean my dishes i have to put all of theirs away so there’s room for mine, i have to be quiet in the evenings because their room has no walls and they can hear me. Me & my father had conversations about him moving out & my brother overheard me & my dad’s conversation, he later told me I was “stabbing him in the back” because I agreed with my dad kicking them out. I feel like an asshole agreeing with my dad but at the same time i think he’s old enough to move out & considering he said he has enough money to start a business i’m sure he won’t be homeless, there’s also 3 adults so i’m sure they could put their money together & buy a place. I honestly really wouldn’t have a problem with them if my brother didn’t try to parent me and speak to me like i’m less than him but it’s beginning to get to me, and even in situations where he’s wrong he and his gf will “gang up” on me.",

(I’m 14f, he’s 17)This has been leaving me with no time to myself. I want to be a doctor so my grades has always been very important to me, I study A LOT. And between that and taking care of my brother I don’t have much of a life. (I skipped two grades so I’m in 10th grade right now and am in a lot of advanced classes so it’s a lot of work).I make my brother’s meals, I help him with homework, I clean up after him, I do his laundry, I’m basically acting like his mom.My brother is not immature and is not enjoying this too much, it’s just what he’s used to and our mother had always sheltered him so he can’t see anything wrong with it.About two months ago I asked him if he want me to teach him how to cook since I got held up at school and he was home alone and almost burned the house down trying to make pasta. He said yes and so I taught him. That escalated to me teaching him everything else I do for him and he’s a fast learner.

He warned me early on that his mom is \"not a helicopter mom but a SUBMARINE mom\", makes light of the situation by joking that she has \"separation anxiety\". She has cancelled our plans more than once because she wanted a \"family day\" and I was excluded. She didn't invite me to celebrate his birthday with them and I don't know if I'm overthinking and reading too much into things, to be fair I could be, but it seems like she wants him all to herself. But... but they live together??? She gets to see him every day and I don't. He is her son, but he's also my boyfriend and he does make time for me and prioritize me but she ultimately has superiority and gets to decide whether he sees me or not. It weirds me out, and I have gotten triggered because yesterday was our 3 month anniversary and she wouldn't let him spend the day with me because she made him do 7 hours of chores and wanted a family movie night. I was not invited. We all had a family movie night the last 2 nights before that, but apparently that wasn't enough or them and doesn't count. I would like more than 2 days a week to see my boyfriend. It's making me feel like she's starting to get possessive of him and not wanting to share with me, which is upsetting me. Again, it could be in my head, but I don't think it's fair that she says he can't see me a third day and the family keeps him to themselves as if he's on a tight leash. I feel excluded. I feel that he does prioritize me the best he can, calls me on his breaks at work every day, good morning texts and gives me updates on his day and checks in, comes to me straight from work on \"our days\". But I'm starting to wonder if our relationship isn't that important to his parents. I'm not some side chick for when they feel like loosening the leash, I'm his girlfriend in a serious and committed relationship. They need to accept that I'm a significant part of his life and they have the luxury of seeing him every day and living with him while I don't.

Her death impacted me profoundly.Fast forward 13 years I got a job offer in oz, upon my arrival he really helped out. One of those things he helped out was was finding me a car. He insisted, and I was willing to take it as if never been in the country before. He took me to car dealerships and when I decided on a car I went to the finance person to organise buying and the payments were too high. I said no it’s not viable  and he off his own back said he would pay a deposit. I was taken a back but this was a few days after landing, jet lag and worrying about having to get a car to get to my new job so I let him. I said after let’s set up a payment plan he said not to worry about it now . It was left as that.Fast forward since then I had been round his numerous times, upgraded my car took it over to show him, he got remarried I was invited etc.When covid hit it changed everything and he never called me or vice versa. When covid finished he went off travelling as did I and well our paths never crossed as his new partners son had a grandchild and I got into a relationship.Our relationship pretty much ceased to exist but I did of course invite him and his partner to my wedding where we are only having 30 people.He responded saying he couldn’t make it.It’s 8 years since I’ve been here and 3 weeks before my wedding and he has my number.Yet he chose to message me on Facebook including my mum stating the “agreed loan amount for the car”, saying he thought of himself as a surrogate parent (I have 2 alive parents) at the time but the relationship wasn’t maintained. Then stating he would “ wipe” the debt as a parting wedding present!Safe to say I was shocked and upset by it all. I’ve never taken money for a loan from anyone besides my parents and well I believed he wanted me to have it as gift to begin with as he never stated at any point he wanted it back. Also why not mention it for 8 years!Anyhow I was so annoyed I told him as such, to  include my mum in such a message written with such umbrage and Why would I want to start a marriage with money not given with the best intent, I asked his account details and paid him back the money immediately.He responded with “unnecessary but Thankyou”.I wanted to respond but refrained and I have nothing good to say.By the way he has plenty of money, so his fine on that front.I’m just so hurt by his actions. I really appreciated everything he did outside of the money when I first came over and now it’s all tainted.

I went to my familys house this past weekend and before leaving, my mom asked me to bring my old prescription of Cipro since she wants to use it for a tooth problem (I don't quite know what the problem is). I originally said no problem.My fiancee saw that I was packing it and was confused as to why I would bring my mom medicine that she wasn't prescribed (especially for a tooth, which my fiancee has said is not commonly fixed with cipro, but other medications). She said it's a bad idea since cipro may alter her body in an unexpected way (build immunity, etc.) and her doctor should be the one to prescribe it. Additionally, she feels it is risky for me to give medicine with my name on it to another person.So I didn't and told my mom that I left them at home accidentally. She was fine with it at the time.I am back at my own home now. An hour ago, she texted me asking if I would mail her the medicine now that I'm home. She said in the same message that her dentist will prescribe her cipro but she said \"don't worry, my son will mail me some.\"I said that I don't feel comfortable mailing it , get it from the dentist since he already prescribed it...and she responded back with this long message yelling at me so not bringing it in the first place. \"You should bring the pills without letting *fiancee* know. This is the racquet doctors pull to keep seeing patients for money. It's a business.\"Now she's saying to \"keep your meds, I'll get my own.\" I feel guilty because she has given me anti-nausea medicine before that was apparently a prescription and that seems hypocritical on my part.I'm in a really tough situation and I feel bad for not helping my mom, but if she was able to get it, I don't know why I'm in the middle.
