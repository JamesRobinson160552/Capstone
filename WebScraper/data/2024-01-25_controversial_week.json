They told me that it's good that I go on these walks. I then told them, lately I've been passing out (due to insomnia and trouble sleeping at night, as well as being burnt out) and missing out on them- they said I should try my hardest to continue doing it though.Last night, I woke up at 9:46, then decided to go on a walk. The next morning I was confronted. She said because I went out I wouldn't be able to meet my girlfriend (we’re long distance and barely see each other). I think, as well as my girlfriend, that I shouldn't go unpunished.. but that I also shouldn't have someone held over my head – especially seeing as it'd be punishing her too.",

	"body" : "I (f18) have 3 sisters, 23, and 19 year old identical twins. My mom (54) is the breadwinner of our family, she’s the cheerleading coach at a large university. All of my sisters cheered in college, but the twins for my mom currently and my eldest sister just graduated. Although my moms denies it, I believe slight nepotism is involved as there’s not a statistical way I have 3 sisters cheer there without nepotism being involved.I cheered competitively pretty much my entire life until 2 years ago. I quit because I was done dealing with the politics on the team and the bullying I received from one teammate. My mom was supportive of me quitting competitive cheer as long as I did my final 2 school season which I did.I had always been very skinny and I kept that way for cheer, but after quitting competition cheer and with my school stunts being pretty much nothing, I realized I didn’t need to stay skinny any longer. For the first time in my life, I ate how I pleased and didn’t feel the need to exercise an excess amount, and I gained around 40 lbs. None of my friends or family have commented negatively on my gain until recently which I was very thankful for.As college approaches for me, I’ve decided that I’d like to cheer again. I asked my mom if I could cheer for the team just like my sisters, and she said no. She claims that because I didn’t do it competitively she couldn’t justify it and that I’ve gotten too out of shape, and she simply couldn’t keep her job if she allowed me on the team.My eldest sister wasn’t good at cheer at all, and the twins aren’t amazing. I feel like my mom is ashamed of having a daughter with fuller hips. I called my mom out on her fat phobia, and she claims that I am fat and if I can’t handle the truth I need to lose weight. This caught me off guard because in two years of me having a more full figure she never said anything remotely like this.I don’t want to be the only one of 4 sisters who don’t cheer in college, and I don’t want to just be a fat girl in the stands compared to my sisters cheering. My mom has apologized for her comments and has tried to say it’s more because I’ve not cheered competitively in years, but I know after her outburst that day it’s because of my figure and her embarrassment of my curves.I understand it’s nepotism, but there aren’t a set number of spots and it’s just who my mom wants. My dad is on my mom's side and said I understood that when I quit cheer this would happen, and my sisters won’t really publicly pick a side, but they have begun to make sly remarks on my weight out of nowhere. My friends do believe I’m in the right but know they’re biased and would support me regardless. I have begun portion control and lost 4 lbs, but it won’t be enough to get to where I was. I now rarely speak to my mom and while I feel like I have some blame I don’t think I’m the a-hole in this situation. AITA?",

	"body" : "My bf (27M) and I (22F) have been in a long-distance relationship for 2 years now and we talk/call daily. We have a set time everyday to call so we avoid scheduling anything during that time as much as possible.I'm flying out on Friday for a competition in which my team and I will be representing our university. During this time, I won't be able to talk to him at all for the next several days (phone policies + being busy with the competition). Thursday at our usual time is the last time we would be able to call before I leave.This is where the problem started... After I told him how I wouldn't be able to talk to him for several days and how Thursday would be the last time, he asked to call earlier in the day on Thursday (mind you, I have classes/office hours earlier so this makes things very hard, at least to talk our usual amount of time). I was confused so I asked him why. He said that a video game was coming out during the time we usually start calling and that he'd like to play it then.I started arguing with him saying he can wait an hour and a half until I have to leave to begin playing. I didn't see why he had to start playing it the literal second it came out. He argued back saying that he'd been waiting for this game for years and that he wanted to play as much as possible before he went back to work (he goes back the day I come back. In other words, he has nothing to do all day except game while I'm gone). I explained that he can play as much as he wants while I'm gone and he'll have extra time especially because we won't be talking like usual. But he's completely refusing to budge on this. He says that he offered to call earlier that day and if that doesn't work for me then we simply won't call at all.Honestly, I was very angry. He knows how much time and energy I put into this. He knows that I am extremely nervous considering it's the first time I've ever flown out for a school competition. He knows that I've never been a captain before and that this is a really huge deal to me.I accused him of prioritizing the video game over me and he just agreed to it and didn't really see the problem. He says whenever I miss a call, that I've prioritize something else over him but I don't really see how that makes sense? If he ever told me he needed me or was not okay with me not calling, I would 100% cancel to talk to him (unless it was something I literally can't get out of).He said he was done talking about this and that his decision was final and I'd have to deal with it and then he hung up on me. I messaged him back asking what the fuck his problem was and now he's mad at me for swearing.AITA?EDIT: Not sure why I'm being spam downvoted for random replies I make. Like if I say he will be asleep so it's not possible to call, like why even? I'm just providing context for the situation :/EDIT 2: I don't know what game it is. All I know is that he is playing on his own. We had no conversation about this game beforeEDIT 3: This is not a vacation, this is a competition. We have a schedule that we have to adhere to, there are rules we have to adhere to. I didn't make these rules, I'm just forced to follow them. Not doing so can result in disqualifications. For those saying it's ridiculous that I can't spare an hour a day to call during it: I am able to call once I got back to the hotel! He will be asleep during that time due to time zone differences though so it's not possible in the end. I literally can't at any other time.",

He's always had a ton of girlfriends, or just random girls he met at bars over at our place when I was younger, they were always gorgeous and i remember them always spoiling me with sweets, or doing my make up etc.Not too long ago, Liam married a woman (Meg, 36) he had met at work. It's awful, we had to move to her house, which resulted in me having move schools to one where I have no friends. She's always moaning about me. They're also expecting a baby in April, which I am dreading. Meg despises me, I'm pretty sure. She's making me follow all the rules she's created (no make up, no dressing how i want, no diets or going out), and she always talks bad about me to my dad. She's totally changed him as well, he just acts old and dresses not at all like himself - he's boring now, nothing like what he used to beThe other day, Meg and I got into an argument about my uniform. I rolled my skirt up a bit and I had make-up as well as fake nails on. She came into my room and started yelling, tell me to put my skirt down and take my make up off, I yelled back that everyone has their skirt rolled up, and that i'm not taking my make up off because most of it is minimal. Besides, Dad did take me to get lash extensions, so I can't just take them out.Liam ended up getting involved, he said to me that i shouldn't rile my step-mam up and just to 'roll the damn skirt down'. I then told him that it's not my fault he's not attractive anymore and had to settle for   Meg, and he shouldn't let her think she's my mam now.Since then, dad's been short with me for insulting him and his wife, and Meg has been even harder on me, saying that they got married because she is a decent, responsible woman and not because she looks like a doll. I've felt a bit bad about it too, because I know Meg's insecure about her looks, and doesn't like thinking about my dad's exes, who were all practically model material.",

	"title" : "AITA for Throwing Away My Fiancé's Old Boots and Buying Him New Ones?",
	"body" : "Hello AITA community, I'm in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some outside perspective. My fiancé and I usually don't have major disagreements, but this incident has left us both upset and I'm not sure if I was in the wrong.For as long as I've known him, my fiancé has had this pair of boots. They're old, really old. He's had them for ages and wears them everywhere – and I mean everywhere, from hiking trails to formal events. I've always found it a bit odd, especially at events where everyone else is dressed up or at least shows some kind of thoughtfulness to their appearance. He insists that they're high-quality boots, the kind that can be rebuilt over and over, and he's quite attached to them. He often talks about how much money he spent on them years ago and how they're meant to look aged and rugged.The thing is, to me, they just look... terrible. They're scuffed, discolored, and honestly a bit embarrassing in certain settings. So, I made a decision that I thought would be a nice surprise. I threw out the old boots and bought him a new pair, a sleek and stylish one that I thought would be more appropriate for a range of occasions. Mind you, he's only mentioned this once about the quality and how he can essentially re-use them or something like that. But he's also very frugal so I thought he just felt guilty spending which is why I decided to just step in and help him out.Well, the surprise didn't go as planned. When he found out, he was livid. He said that those old boots were special to him, that they looked as they should, etc. He accused me of not understanding the worth of well-made, lasting items. He's also quite upset about the new boots I bought, calling them \"cheap looking mall boots\" and saying they're nowhere near the quality of his old ones. I also accused him of not reading the room and noticing when his shoes are CLEARLY not appropriate and standout in the worst way possible.I feel terrible. I genuinely thought I was doing something nice for him, updating his wardrobe a bit and saving him the embarrassment of wearing those rugged old boots to nice places. But now I wonder if I've completely disregarded his feelings and attachment to those boots.So, AITA here? Was I wrong to throw away his old crusty boots and replace them with something I thought was better? I thought I was being thoughtful, but his reaction has made me doubt my actions.EDIT: It's clear the consensus is IATA. I spoke to my fiance again it is only now that he told me they were a pair of boots that were custom made to his feet sizing. I looked up the company and the prices are so absurd I almost cried. I asked him why he never ever brought up that he had a custom pair of boots! I imagine no one has something like that or at least very few people that it's something worth mentioning! I just have to admit I was wrong and that's it, I cannot even come close to affording a new pair of those same boots for him.",

I paid for her ticket and left our 6 year old with a friend.We were slightly rushed as we made it to the airport a little late and weren't sure about the lines at security.Unfortunately for my wife once we crossed security, the heel on her boot broke. I don't know why but she insists on wearing heels everywhere and was all dressed up for this trip. Like not completely broken but would completely fold outward so she had to walk on tip toe.Unfortunately there weren't too many shops and the shops we found was rather expensive.Most of the women's shoes were weird looking but she liked one pair of heeled boots. However it was around $350 which while I could afford it, it didn't seem reasonable to me. We were already near the gate so I suggested looking again at our layover airport in Europe.Unfortunately we had the same problem there, while there were more shops many of them were closed and the one open shop we found in out terminal had even more outrageous prices of around 400€.Eventually I just told her to wait until we arrived and she changed her shoes when we picked our checked bags.AITA here? She is a SAHM so she doesn't have her own money and after the cost of flights, and paying my friend to babysit we'd already spent more than usual. She seemed to handle it fine, just had to walk on tip toe and put less pressure on the broken heel and I carried the heavier cabin luggage. However she got upset with me after we arrived despite nit saying much during the trip.",

	"body" : "1, 26F, just got married to the love of my life, 32M, in december. He proposed in summer 2022 but we decided to hold off on the wedding due to some personal reasons. I have never gotten along with my SIL, 25F, she is always trying to put me down and is overall not the kindest. I met my husband through her when I was 20 and she's been kind of distant since then. While her and I were friends I shared a lot about my insecurities. I used to be 300 pounds and was very insecure about it. I went on a weight loss journey but she always felt the need to compete with me but she wasn't able to lose the weight. If I worked out for an hour she had worked out for 2 or, if I chose something healthy on the menu she would laugh at me. Despite us drifting this hasn't really gone away. I have lost some weight and am at a healthy weight now. It's important to note I only lost weight for health reasons and not appearance reasons, despite this, I think losing weight has made men more attracted to me(not that this is important). I am now thinner than her, she is chubby but not fat like I was.Of course she was at my wedding, she was a bridesmaid and her and I were actually getting along well and there were few issues. She was actually super supportive during the whole process. The ceremony was gorgeous and I wouldn't hesitate to call it the best day of my life. During the reception the cake came out and everyone was having it and I noticed that she wasn't. I could see her eyeing me as I ate cake. I had 2 slices and by the time I was on my second slice I could feel her eyes. I felt like she was judging me for eating cake after my weight loss. I think she is jealous because I was able to lose weight and she wasn't. I was tipsy and decided to confront her. I asked her what her problem was and why she isn't eating the cake. She seemed offended but didn't say anything. This upset me more and I lost it, I told her she thinks she's a good person when she's really not. I also accused her of being in love with my husband. She left in tears and the rest of the night was tainted from the interaction. My maid of honor texted me and told me I way overreacted and some other guests shared her sentiment. I haven't apologized but have been thinking about it since my MIL cut off me and my husband. My husband agrees she's probably in love with him and I should just leave it alone. AITA?EDIT: I want to give more context on our friendship. When I was bigger than her she would make remarks about me being the cow of the friend group. When I started my weight loss she made fun of me for it. Now that I am thinner than her I think she’s jealous that I’m able to eat cake now.",

He said he didn’t like that because it was showing my ego. From his perspective, we were both comfortable and warm in bed and I could’ve gotten up to get it myself. Why should he get up and do it when I’m perfectly capable of it? He also said I was being lazy.I explained that yes, I was comfortable in bed and that is probably why I asked him to grab me some water in that moment. But I asked because it was something I would appreciate from him, and it would make me happy. Why wouldn’t he want to do that simple gesture? I’m having trouble wrapping my head around his resistance for doing nice things for me.I told him if he asked me to do the same of course I would because I want to make him happy and I know it’s something he’d appreciate. He said he would never ask me to do that though, because he’s perfectly capable of doing it himself.Am I letting my ego show? Please help, I don’t want to be an asshole :(Edit: My own curiosity has gotten the best of me. Those who are commenting, I would love to know if you are currently in relationship. I wonder if this has any baring over one’s opinion? I’ve been getting very mixed responses and am genuinely curious.Edit 2: Someone said I should add this comment I made to give more context since here it is!“Not trying to defend myself (well, I guess by definition I am haha) but when I think about it I do feel I do things for my boyfriend to try and show I care. I’ll clean his apartment when he’s at work, make the bed for him even though it’s not something he does for himself, etc. I think this might be why I didn’t think it was the biggest deal to ask him to do a favor for me.”Edit 3 (and most likely final): A lot more people have chimed into this post than I initially expected. I’ve been trying to respond to people who have (mostly) civil.Wanted to clear a few things up: A lot of people have been mentioning I am “playing mind games” by asking if he could get me a glass of water. While I can’t know for sure if that’s what I was doing subconsciously, I promise it was not that deep lol. It was such a fleeting moment. To me I was just asking a favor, just as he has asked me in other scenarios.I didn’t demand, I asked. And he said sure. A LOT of assumptions are being made about the type of people my boyfriend and I are. If you need more info, just ask me to clarify and I’ll be upfront and honest. It’s crazy to me that people are assuming I “constantly nag” and am “purposefully manipulating” him. Same goes for my boyfriend, please don’t assume he’s a terrible person I should just ditch. After reading through the comments, I think at the end of the day we show our love in different ways. A lot of people have been saying my love language is acts of service and it made sense to me.Edit 4: Forgot to mention another assumption being made. This is my fault for not being clear in the comments. We weren’t laying in bed saying our goodnights with the lights out. We were watching TV and both occasionally getting up to go to the bathroom or something like that. Not sure if this makes a difference for people.",

(Total 3 days). He said he would check.Today, while in bed, I reminded him again to confirm since I wanted to book a nice hotel. Also today I saw that his favorite stand up comic will be in town. So I asked him if he could take another day off, since we would need to stay an extra day to catch the show. (Total 4 days).He then started to sound agitated and annoyed. We talked back and forth as to what workload does he have to not be able to take additional days.I calmly and softly explained to him why this short vacation was needed and it was just for him to relax and rest a bit.To make it short, he finished the conversation in an ordering and angry manner saying “I can’t. Also this extra day, I’m 90% sure I can’t.”I turned around in bed and cried, because I was hurt that he is unable to see that I’m doing this for him. What bothered me more is that rather than sounding apologetic and sad he won’t be able to take a short vacay, he was very argumentative and annoyed and all he did was fight with me.(I did not need a vacation, as I’m a housewife who works occasionally). It was for him.So while I cried, he turned his back to me. Then he asked “Why are you crying?” I then told him “You’re being an asshole.” He got angrier, and I rephrased and said “You’re being a bad husband”.He got pissed I told him he was being an asshole and walked out and left me in the bed crying.Now I’m in the guest room, alone.

I asked her what she wanted and she said a 2 face pancake pallete which is eyeshadow or vinyl of her favorite album.Obviously vinyls ore everywhere but the one she wanted was only on certain sites and isn’t streaming on main sites and both gifts cost around $50-$60~.We’ve been dating for 2 1/2 years so her being “worth the money” was never the question.

Also it wasn’t a shitty mixtape I hunted around for the best audios and tried my best to decorate the top so it would stand out) so she could more conveniently listen to it in her car or at work or home plus got her flowers and her favorite candy and made reservations for a nice restaurant.Joan seemed happy during our date but later texted me saying she’d rather have just gone to dinner than gotten the other gifts.I don’t get it.

J said to me that he’d really appreciate it if I did so and it would “make D feel like part of the family”. The issue I have with this is threefold. First of all, D’s mother is already throwing her a bridal shower. Throwing her a second one would just be repetitive. Second of all, J and I are not even part of D’s culture, and I wouldn’t feel comfortable taking part in activities like that for risk of offending or appropriating her culture. Third of all, and this is where I fear I’ll come across as an asshole, D isn’t part of the family, not until she and my son are wed. So it feels wrong to me to celebrate her as a family member when, let’s be honest, she isn’t.I laid this all out to J, who had basically no reaction at first. He just sat and listened for my reasons. Afterwards he shrugged and went “alright then”. This conversation happened a couple weeks ago, and since then he’s been avoiding me. Even when we talk things are stiff. I figured he was upset about something I said during that talk so we talked about it last night. I asked him how he felt about what I said and whether I upset him. I’m paraphrasing he essentially said that he wasn’t surprised, but just disappointed.He said that he wasn’t surprised because my husband and I never threw him parties, we never celebrated his achievements or anything and it was disappointing to hear that that extended to D as well. I was kind of struck dumb by this because yes, my husband and I are not celebratory people by nature, but we always showed him to the best of our ability that we loved him. To that end I said I’d be willing to compromise in a way, and said that after the wedding and their honeymoon I’d love to take D out to lunch or dinner with my friends and just get some girl time with her.He was very upset by now and said that that wasn’t what this is about and stormed off.

We made the decision to wait to tell our families until Christmas 2023 as a dun Christmas surprise.When we went to see my mom, I was prepared for her to say something about it because she thinks we are rushing into things too quickly and she is a bit of a helicopter mom. When we told her, her reaction was exactly that. She did say she was happy for us but told us we should hold off on the wedding for a couple years (i.e. 2026 or later) to make sure we want to get married. We both just brushed it off and our plan is still to get married in October of 2024.We told the rest of my close family/friends and so far everyone else has been really happy for us besides my grandmother (mom's mom). My grandma reacted the same way as my mom but has told us multiple times that she is happy for us and has welcomed my fiance with open arms so I'm not too worried.Currently the problem is that every time I even mention the wedding (and sometimes when I don't) my mom has to bring up that we should wait to get married. She doesn't even listen to me when I tell her that my fiance is the love of my life/soulmate and neither my fiance or I can think of a way that we wouldn't be together.It got to the point where I was physically sick with emotion because one of the things I dreamed about was going to wedding boutiques and doing wedding stuff with my mom. Like that's what mom's usually do when their child is getting married. I also have distanced myself from really doing anything to plan for the wedding which my fiance understands but we are on a bit of a time crunch so we are a bit behind on things.I am to the point where I am currently ignoring calls/texts from my mom because I don't want to hear her thoughts about the wedding. I have also decided to tell her that if she doesn’t want to support my fiance and I getting married and will just keep commenting on it that she will be uninvited from the wedding and I don't really want her to be apart of my life anymore.AITA for deciding to tell my mom this?Edit: I forgot to add that I don't have a very strong relationship with my mom because she doesn't understand that I'm non-binary and that I don't like guys.Edit 2: I read a lot of comments about concern for marrying young and that a parent should be worried about their child marrying young. I guess part of my family (my dad's side, including myself) is used to it because a lot of the family married young on that side. I did ask my dad what he thought about it and he said as long as we have the money to pay for wedding costs go for it but if we don't then we should wait.

Second issue is Anna reads into their every interaction way too much, and her friends hype her up. “Omg he hugged me and called me a legend when I offered to drive him to the gym” “omg he responded to my dm” etc etc.Her friends hype her up and tell her to go for it and are putting it in her head he might like her, even though, he definitely doesn’t but I tried to just ignore it. I tried to warn him about what was going on and while talking to him about Anna yesterday, he said “she’s such a lovely girl, it’s a shame she a dog”. And he then went onto say “I don’t think there is a single thing attractive about her”. That sort of spelt things out loud and clear.Earlier her friends were again hyping her up after he responded to another dm of hers, and she said she was going to ask him out (keep in mind she KNOWS he has a gf) and I felt so awful I had to stop it.  I told her she has no hope, ever, that he has a girlfriend who he realistically is never going to leave for her, and that her friends should be ashamed of themselves for feeding her delusions. I then said that he barely sees her as a friend and she should get real and drop her obsession before she gets hurt or humiliated. Anna teared up and ran out of the room, and one of her friends went after her. The rest of her friends started berating me and then also followed her.Thing is she was literally about to do it right there and I snapped into action. I feel I worded it harsher than I had to and am wondering if I should have just let her get rejected. AITA?",

I understood how this friend’s presence can bother him, but even if I invite someone else, I don’t see the point of my boyfriend being there if he’s not into coasters - it would be a waste of a ticket.

My girlfriend was on the verge of an anxiety attack and it took me awhile to calm her down.

I also can’t imagine our future lives if she is serious about never flying anywhere.So I told her all that.

	"body" : "I (22F) have a younger sister named Mabel (20F). Growing up, Mabel was always very academically inclined. However, she was also always shy. She got bullied a lot in grade school for reasons such as being \"too fat\" \"too weird\" \"too crazy\" \"a crybaby\" \"too ugly\". Mabel just wanted to show up and get her responsibilities done to the best of her abilities. She had some friends but has since lost contact since leaving grade school for high school (she had no phone at the time).When she was in 4th grade, a few boybands came onto the scene. That was one of the more difficult years as that was one of the peaks of bullying she endured, plus our parents were getting divorced and her teacher at the time favoured the boys who bullied her. She did admit to trying to fit in during this period. She started listening to them and they seemed to help her get through these hard times. Once finished all schoolwork, she would listen to their music and read as much as she could about them to learn as much as she could about them. She is still a walking encyclopedia about these bands to this day, and since then LOTS more information about the individuals in the bands and stuff has been coming out. She sometimes tends to harp on things for too long or monologue about them, and this was no exception. When asked to talk about something else, she would go quiet, though she says its hard for her brain to think about other things outside of school sometimes because she really loves the bands.There was also an incident in high school where two girls were gossiping about her in front of our mom at the grocery store, calling her \"weird\". There's one who I suspect envies Mabel because Mabel had better grades than she did, especially in English. Also, a guy that she liked was staring at Mabel's butt and not her and that made her upset.Mabel is now in a prestigious university and doesn't see any of them. I noticed that others were nice in high school, though it didn't seem like Mabel tried to get close to any of them. I thought uni would be a good opportunity for her to learn social skills and branch out and make friends.Recently, she and I were on the train, as I work near her uni and was thus helping her find classes and stuff (also there have been crime incidents on public transport so I wanted to keep her safe). A uni classmate came up to her and said \"Hello\" and Mabel was sharing how her Christmas went. The classmate then proceeded to ask Mabel about band C, the least mainstream of the bands she liked. Mabel said she didn't have time to check as she had been busy. They then proceeded to talk about their classes and TikTok.I asked Mabel why she was talking about band C with classmates, as I told her she shouldn't because the topic is niche and I worry that her peers would find her weird for liking that band. I asked her who mentioned band C first, and she said she didn't remember. She also talked about them at our Halloween party. AITA?",

I’ve been thinking about this for awhile, like the last 15 years.Context: en I was growing up my family had a cat, and then when I was a little older we got a dog. And I loved them dearly. I’ve always wanted to adopt a dog or cat on my own, but wasn’t really ready for the responsibility during college. And then after graduating I moved out of the US for a few years so I didn’t adopt while abroad.Luckily during this time I was living with Roommates who usually did have pets and I loved it - while not mine, being around animals was always so much fun.Anyways I also met my (now) husband while I was abroad, and I was always open with him about wanting to have a pet. My husband does not share that feeling. He did not grow up with pets, and while he’s lived with pets and is not allergic. This is starting to become an issue now. We’ve been together for 11 years, married for 7 and have 2 young kids. When we  moved back to the US (like 9 years ago) we had a really small apartment in a big city. We got engaged (around the same time) and he said he’d be okay getting a pet once we had a bigger place. Well after a few years we got a bigger place with a yard and a fence. So I started talking about getting a pet. He said he’d prefer a dog to a cat, but that getting one would be irresponsible as we were both working full time in the office and wouldn’t be spend enough time with the dog who’d be home all day alone. Fair. I waited. Then we both started to have more flexible schedules and I got a remote job that let me work from home. I ask again about getting a dog, and he said ‘okay, you can get a dog, but just know if you do my quality of life will be extremely negatively impacted if you do.’So at the time I was like - a little dramatic maybe, but I’m not going to do something that would cause you so much harm. But kind of always felt like the ball was in my court. That was about 5 years ago.Since then we’ve had our two kids (4&1) and we moved out of the city to a really outdoorsy place with loads of trails. I’ve taken a new higher paying WFH role that way less of a demand on my schedule with a bump in pay and I’m thinking of adopting a pet again. I brought it up with my husband recently and he immediately said absolutely not. No discussion. Just pure annoyance at the thought.But he now travels a lot for work while I’m with the kids (when they’re not at daycare) by myself a lot of the week. I’m at a place where I can take pretty much all the responsibility on.Plus I feel like we had come to an agreement when we we got engaged about getting a pet but the goalposts kept changing and now we’re here.I guess I’m finding I care less about how his quality of life will be impacted and more about my own wants. And that’s what it is - a want, I don’t need a pet but I’ve waited a long time and feel like I’m done waiting.",

I had developed severe depression and twice seriously tried to end my life.when the selling got planned, I pleaded for keeping or subletting the house a) as the financially sounder decision and b) since the house was built on old family ground that was GIVEN to my parents FOR FREE, plus the build was in large part paid by SELLING MORE OF IT, plus my grandpa was a mason and did most of the work, also for free. please note this! I was ignored.my parents have built a flat-pack house in the yard (despite the old house having a retirement-friendly, one-level flat!).after the sale, I asked whether my brother and me would get some of the money they got out of the sale. they declined, saying we would inherit once they're dead. that is also the legal position where they are.

One parent is unable to be in the wrong and seems to gaslight in every situation so they are never wrong/at fault, even if it means being hurtful to us or denouncing our feelings.The other is difficult to live w for other reasons, including the people they have as roommates.We went over to visit my brother and have fun. A screaming fight breaks out between brother and parent 1. Things end with him not feeling safe in his own home and looking for a way out (same for parent 1). If he goes to parent 2's house he gets in a different cycle of bs only to inevitably go back to parent 1. I am the only other person my brother has left to turn to. And in the last year, I have seen him get section 12'd at least 3 times, visit multiple mental hospitals, and go off his meds and end up lost in the woods without shoes or a jacket.So that night they were fighting I panicked. I told him to pack a bag and got my partner on the phone (he had been in the car avoiding the fight). He did NOT want my brother to come to our house. I may trust my brother, mostly, but he does not. We had just moved me out a few months ago so my partner probably felt like we escaped.I tried to give my partner a choice but essentially decided that my brother should come with us. That was my bad. I probably should've taken no for an answer but I felt backed into a corner.My brother seems super calm with us and of course asks if staying long term and taking up the one empty room we have would be ok. I've felt guilty for having a spare room and bed this whole time while we've watched our friends and family members face homelessness and turmoil.

They seem to be very codependent on each other, Nowell seems to find it sweet but I think it's unhealthy and I've started putting up boundaries between them.Due to their bad behaviour being influenced by one another, they no longer can text each other at school, nor can they both go out at the same time.

May wears clothes way too adult for her, and she always goes overboard on the make up.

After her date she came home overly excited and all she could talk about was Sam.  I told her that quite frankly I'm surprised this he wanted to go out with her and I question his motives.

I Don't smoke, never have, and i don't want to be with someone that smokes. From our second date I've let him know that i don't like it, but i couldn't do anything about it as we weren't even official yet. A few months into our relationship i told him that i don't  want him to smoke regularly, as it's unhealthy, and something bad always happens. It was going back and forth, i did some research and noticed it was not allowed in our religion either. After me stating that it's my preference and him stating that it's a part of him, i said that i just don't wanna be with someone that needs to smoke to have more fun. After some discussing, he agreed.He broke our agreement, as he kept smoking. After an argument he promised to fully stop smoking. About a month later, that dumb*ss sent me a video of him, petting a cat, and forgetting that he had a big roll of  in his hand. I found out that he has been lying to me all the time about this and he had been smoking. Long story short, after a lot of making up, he has now stopped completely (i believe).Now for the issue, he doesn't like the way i dress. I have a certain style, and it's really not that bad i believe. I don't wear crop tops with mini skirts all the time or go out with inappropriate chlothes. He doesn't like me showing any skin or wearing tight chlothes like leggings. F.e. i was wearing a hoodie and flarepants, and he thought it was too much (the pants).Thing is, on our first date, he told me my outfit was perfect, not too revealing but also not too covered up (in his words). It was summer and i was wearing flare pants and a tank top. He also asked me at the start of our relationship, if i would want to cover up more if we were meeting his family. He said you can dress how you want to dress normally, but his family is a little conservative so for a good impression, dress a little modestly. I agreed and understood because my family is the same way. When he asked me to be his girlfriend i was wearing a bright, tight red dress.For all these reasons, i think he gave me the impression that he was okay with how i dress. I didn't give him that impression with smoking though. He thinks i should make a sacrifice too, but I think this is not necessary as I'm not even really wearing skimpy clothes ( in my opinion).

She just kept going on and on about how I had \"belittled\" her and how I needed to apologize. If anyone is due an apology, it's me, and I can't help but find the absurdity of her position humorous. Today, she barely kissed me before heading off to work, and it's pretty clear that she is unable to admit that she's in the wrong, even for one second. She didn't used to be this big of an egomaniac, and I'm starting to question what I can do to help her learn appropriate behavior. I'm feeling pretty defeated. AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA: Am I Being Unfairly Criticized for my Noise Levels in my Dorm Room?",
	"body" : "I live in a dorm room with no roommates, but am surrounded by neighbors on both sides. I tend to watch a fair amount of TV, which I've always tried to keep to a low volume level, as I'm naturally very conscious of those around me and try hard to place others' comfort before my own. In fact, my volume tends to be so low that I actually need subtitles to help me understand the words from across the room. Additionally, I have very good hearing, so I think my notion of acceptable noise levels is accurate.Well, a couple months back, my RA texted me about receiving a noise complaint in regards to a movie I was watching. I'll admit, this time the volume was SLIGHTLY higher than I usually have it, but I would still say it was far from blaring or even really being loud at all (just high enough that I didn’t need the subtitles). Regardless though, I felt so bad that I just turned my movie off in the middle of it to make certain I wouldn’t be a bother, and I've since made an even greater effort to keep my volume down—I think—extremely low.I'd assumed the girl who made the complaint was the one who lives in the room opposite the wall right where my TV is placed, as I'd have guessed—perhaps due to the thin walls of the dorm room—the volume might sound louder to her than it did to me sitting on the opposite side of the room.However, this morning, I received multiple knocks on my door at about 8:30 AM. To my surprise, it was my neighbor across the wall on the OPPOSITE side of the TV—further away even than my own location when watching TV. She was pretty sweet, but—in my opinion—harped too long on the fact that she “hears what I’m playing ALL THE TIME” and that it's very disruptive to her studying.I told her repeatedly that I was very sorry, and she was kind about it, but I've spent the day feeling somewhat frustrated by her complaint. I feel like I'm now unable to relax in my own room, as I can’t fathom how I could watch or listen to anything at any volume level that would be acceptable to her, and my ears don’t tolerate earbuds or headphones well, so it would be an added layer of annoyance for me to have to use them within the confines of my own walls.I was also told by a friend a while back that this neighbor has a bad hearing sensitivity, which could explain why she's able to hear these noises which I think are extremely minimal. I feel bad that I’m being a disruption even after all my effort not to be, but I feel she could’ve been a bit nicer about it, or at least recognized the fact that it's likely (or at least potentially) her fault—due to her hearing sensitivity—that she's having problems, and not mine. I've lived in this dorm for three years and have never received any other complaints, so I just would have appreciated some more grace and not so much blame for the situation. AITA, or am I right to be a bit frustrated and to feel like I am being unfairly criticized in this situation?",

Because of this I have always viewed her as my cat.But here’s the problem; since my roommate already had another cat before we found this one he immediately assumed all of the care expenses. He’s paid every vet bill and taken her to every appointment, he buys all her food and litter and whatever else. He’s never asked me to chip in which I just assumed was as a favor because my financial situation is less than stable. He also does most of the household care for the cats like maintaining the litter box and feeding them. However I play with them a lot more often than he does.We’re going to be moving out of this place soon and going our separate ways l told him that I was intending to take Phoebe. He was immediately like “are you stupid?” and told me that there’s no chance of me taking the cat because I’ve never contributed to the care expenses (he’s never asked me to), I’m “too broke to take care of her future expenses” (but I could crowdfund it if I need to), the “place i’m planning to move is too small for a cat” (studio apartment but I plan to make her an indoor/outdoor cat instead of indoor only like she is now) and that she’d be depressed living with me because she’s bonded to my roommates older cat. Which sounds like BS because she would just get over it. He accused me of not being responsible enough to care for a pet even though he’s fine letting me take care of them when he goes out or town.I don’t think it’s stupid to assume that a cat that I saw first and gave a name to and play with all the time belongs to me. I could even pay back the expenses eventually when I have more income. I’m considering taking her with me when I move out regardless of what he has to say about it. AITA?",

He's been living with them for the past ten years, they've even gotten to the point where they want to adopt him before he legally becomes an adult, but it's been a struggle.I do see him occasionally, although usually the time we spend together is overlooked by Gail. She is overprotective of Gene to a fault, she acts as though he is five, not fifteen. They just don't seem to understand that he is a teenager now, not a child who needs to be forced into conforming to their useless rules.He isn't allowed to dictate what he looks like, I once bought him a band t-shirt that he asked for, and apparently it was confiscated for being 'inappropriate.' - it was a The Smiths t-shirt. Any sort of 'alternative' aesthetic he tries to go for is shut down. He's not allowed to stay out with his friends past 8pm, and Gail seems to think that our relationship is unhealthy because we hug each other, and because he once fell asleep with his head on my lap.It was his birthday recently, I took him up to Manchester for it. At one point, we ended up going into Affleck's, and at the back of one of the shops is a piercing studio. As I had a fair bit of money on myself, I offered to pay for him to get a piercing - he ended up getting his lip done. We even bought him a clear retainer for when he has to go to school.His parents were not pleased however, and Gene texted me about them getting very upset over it. Last time I came over to their place to see Gene, they started berating me for not asking their permission beforehand, saying that if he got an infection his placement could've been jeopardised, and that I had no right to make that call on allowing him to modify his body.Personally, I saw nothing wrong with it, I mean he's old enough to decide if he wants a removable piece of metal in his face or not.

I am now studying creative media production in college and have been since September. I have 4 tutors on my course, one of which is an audio teacher who is hard of hearing. Yep, you read that right. A practically deaf audio teacher. You couldn't write this.Now my timetable is structured OK apart from one day, Monday. On this day I have a 3 hour session in the morning with a graphic design teacher who's lovely and energetic and gets everyone going on a Monday morning, I then have a 90 minute break until a one hour session with said deaf audio teacher. Now I went to this session every time I had it before Christmas, and I realised that this teacher doesn't actually teach anything new within the session, and given that when we ask him questions, he always comes right up to us given his lack of hearing, so it's altogether a really awkward session.Furthermore, the session is timed horribly as the end of the session is precisely when my bus back home leaves, so I have to wait a further hour or spend an extra £2.90 for a SINGLE to a place where I have to catch another bus which is always delayed due to school ending at the same time. So in the end, I decided the session is not worth going to. Not in the mind of the lecturer. He thinks that the hour is incredibly valuable (despite the fact that I can also do the work at home), and that if I persist in missing this particularly shitty 1-hour session, he will call my parents and tell them I have been missing loads of college which isn't the case as I attend all his other sessions (no matter how painful they are).

I noticed they all had a tight tubular \"mask\" on over their nose and mouth, like a thick sock. It looked pretty uncomfortable for them.My uncle explained that the owners had put \"spit masks\" / \"spit socks\" on all the alpacas before our arrival and it was a common thing, and something he requested all clients to do before an alpaca shearing.The goal is to deter them from spitting (since the spit will backfire) and to make sure you don't get spit on.Well, I didn't think that was a very good justification for something like that.

	"body" : "AITA for asking my (39f) roommate (40somethingm) to wipe his shit smears off the toilet bowl after using the toilet?So I've been living with a friend since halfway last year and he has a habit of leaving shit streaks on the toilet bowl of our shared bathroom. It's not an occasional issue - it's constant. And he just leaves it, shit smears collecting for months at a time. There's a separate toilet closer to my bedroom which I use exclusively now because that toilet is so gross (which I clean regularly). I refuse to clean his shit so that toilet just gets left to fester. The only shower is in the shared bathroom so just not going in there is not an option.I've spoken to him a few times about this but it seems like we have misunderstood each other as we just had another sit down conversation about it and I had to fully spell it out - after you poop, have a look to see if there's poop on the bowl and if so, wipe it up. He looked at me like I was crazy and said I was being ridiculous.Things got pretty tense and he demanded that I explain to him exactly what I expected of him - did I expect him to clean the entire bowl? Even down to the water line? Even if his hand would get wet? (I actually had to explain that I use the brush in this case). Do I expect him to wipe up every single speck of shit, every single time?I said I was willing to compromise - perhaps instead of every single time he could just commit to cleaning the toilet once per week instead. He insisted that no amount of compromise would leave him feeling better about it because he doesn't believe he should have to do it, so he would just do it exactly the way I want, but that he would move out at the end of the lease. This is probably for the best after this exchange, but the whole thing has left me absolutely reeling and wondering if my expectations are unrealistic. AITA?",

We were friends, talked about everything pregnancy related, including names. We talked about names every time I saw her because her and BIL couldn't agree on anything. My husband and I had a name picked out for our first child before we knew it was a boy, so 8 years prior we had a girl name we loved.When she was 8 months pregnant we talked a final time about names, they still didn't have one, so I said this is the name we're using (ex. Annabell), please just don't use this one (just not Anna!). The rest of the visit went great, next 2 months and her baby shower came and went without issue.Fast forward to her giving birth and they announce to the family via group chat their name - a very similar name - think Annabell and Annabeth. I'm pissed and stop responding to the group texts.A week later husband and BIL are taking and it comes out that we're upset. They go on the defensive and say the conversation never happened, the names aren't that similar, how could we be acting like this.There's no real resolution.  We still used the name for our girl and now my young boys confuse the babies whenever we see them. I actively only call their baby by her full name and our baby by the nickname Anna.I could get over the name if they had talked to us beforehand but the way it was handled just makes me feel like they're bad friends/family and why would I want to hangout with people like that.

It started on Christmas Eve, 2022 when she was “cleaning” but it sounded like a construction zone upstairs. I was stressed already because my cat was sick and I remember asking her to stop the noise after it had gone on for at least 3 hours. Our condos are both 460 sq ft, so I don’t see how it would take several hours to clean a space just slightly bigger than an extended stay hotel room.Ever since then, she’s made it a point to be as obnoxious as possible at all hours of the day/night. I work full time, run a small business, and go to school part time. She will wait until she realizes I am home to start back up and is so loud now that I can hear her over noise-canceling headphones. The property management company has told me to call the police (part of their policy) when it becomes too much, but this is an almost everyday occurrence when she is home and I’m not about to call everyday for a noise disturbance as their resources are better used elsewhere. Property management has fined her, but it’s done nothing. The police have told her to quiet down, to which she will until they leave (she’ll watch out her window).She has also started spreading rumors that I bully her for being disabled, that I have physically threatened her, and my friends (who were here at the time helping me with my mental health) have no business being in my condo, while she’s allowed to have friends over. It’s getting to the point where I don’t enjoy coming home anymore. I just want to come home and be able to rest or do my homework in peace and quiet but I can’t. My landlord has tried to talk to her landlord and it does nothing, so WIBTA for suing her for emotional distress?Edit: I don’t have money to just up and move as some of you have suggested.

I make about 2/3 of what she used to make, but I said I would take care of our shared expenses (rent/utilities/groceries) until she found a new job. She had some savings but I told her to allocate those to her own expenses like her stupidly expensive car payment, insurance and whatever else she wants to spend it on.While she’s been at home she has taken the role of taking care of the house which I appreciate. She cooks my lunches, cleans, takes care of our 2 messy cats, goes to do the grocery shopping with my credit card, and I always come home from work with dinner ready to go. I never asked her to, but appreciate it nonetheless.One night she accidentally popped her last pair of rubber gloves with her nail and asked me to do the dishes. She usually keeps a stock of rubber gloves in case since sometimes I drop them in the sink and get the inside wet and she has to throw it out. For context, she has some sensory issue thing and will not touch dishwater/food in sink with her bare hands since she was like 15.I had a really rough day at work and just wanted to relax and play games, so I told her I would do them tomorrow but she said that I always say that and never do, and that she won’t go to bed with a sink full of dishes. Here’s where i might be the asshole; I told her to suck it up and just do it then, it’s just dishwater and it’s not gonna hurt her. I also said that it was her job now cus I was the one making money.

These all started after he made friends with some bad crowds, a group of pre-teens, and teenagers who calls themselves drumstick something-something gang and claims the neighborhood as their turf. We have separated him from these friends, and as lonely as he is now, at least he is not around questionable people.When he was still with this group, he was constantly angry and frustrated with everyone around him, unwilling to participate in family activities, or talk about his ideas. He is much better now, more patient and open with us, and he isn't throwing angry tantrums.However, he has now started calling his mom as b*tch instead of mom. Although, he has decent conversations with us, he never fails to add that in most sentences. Whenever he calls her, he screams it from across the room. We, including his dad, have tried to make him stop using that word on his mom, but he still continues to do so.I had enough of his tactic, so when my wife and I were making family plans with our kids, I started to refer to him like I was talking about a family dog, and even added \"his name\"-the-doggy- dog as a hint to him. It wasn't anything major, but obviously, for a kid, it was upsetting, and he burst into tears and ran to his room. That night, he refused to come out and have dinner with us, and since then, he hasn't had any meals with us. He eats in his room.My wife is unhappy with my action and calls it an AH move. We have had some arguments about it here and there, but I think that if he wants to call his mom that, then he should also learn what that means for him.

Starscream the type of guy who talks about communication but won't talk to his coworkers.

That left me and my old coworker ,Mr. Jenkins and starscream all alone. If you can't tell by now I don't like starscream very much. So I avoid the guy because he's an idiot, but he saw a woman he suspected of stealing. He then texts not calls texts me to help him find her. TEXTS ME!!! he then TEXTS ME to tell me where she was he never called me when you see someone that you think is going to steal you CALL not text the team for backup so you can maintain observation on the person. Starscream never called me and was on the phone having a private chat with someone elseSo eventually I see Jenkins and I tell him that we're watching a lady Jenkins got his phone to work this time and we did well the lady didn't steal but she confronted me for watching her.... It happens. I retreated to the break room so I could avoid a scene. That's when Jenkins called me. He said why didn't you tell me this was starscreams case.This evolved into starscream finding us and saying how we have to \"communicate\". I cut him off and said don't talk about communication when this is your case And you never called me. He told me he was testing me because I never call him for nothing. If shay were here you'd call her. I said yes I would she's competent. Also who are you test me? He said he's got the most experience it's common sense. I said you've been doing this since 2021 I've been doing this since 2019 and Mr Jenkins since before we were born. You have the least experience that's common sense. I then added so instead of working a case properly you decided to \"test\" me to see if I called you. I then said this is why you'll never be a supervisor and of the 4 us you're considered the weakest link. You're an idiot and all you ever do is profit off of Shay's success. I walked off on him.Later on in the shift starscream had to leave early for anger management classes.

I ended up marrying the other woman and over the years me, my wife, and my ex wife have made peace with everything. On the other hand, my daughter has not made peace with everything as she found out about the reasons behind the divorce later on and still has a hard time accepting what happened.At some point two years ago, my daughter reached out to me privately via email to unload everything she’s felt for over a decade and I had no clue what to say to it other than I couldn’t believe I caused this much pain. It was a novel of her feelings related to the divorce and how I went about everything related to being supportive of her hobbies, to how she felt staying at my house on the weekends, and even how I skipped her university graduation years ago, which I thought we moved past. My wife somehow saw the email and immediately texted my daughter telling her how horrible she is and how bad the email made her look because she hates being called a mistress. My daughter was incredibly hurt because she thought the email was only to be read by me and has since cut me off completely, going as far to cut me out of all her social media.

In my country you get about 1,5 years worth of days you can take out to be on parental leave, most people save some of these days so they can stay home occasionally with their child as they get older. I am planning on taking all of these days and stay home until my son is at least 4. Of course a lot of planning has gone into this, I know we can’t eat the most extravagant food, buy the newest clothes or take expensive trips. But to me, staying home and taking care of my son is worth it.

So every Saturday I take him to an open preschool, don’t know if it exists in the US but basically, everyone is welcome there with their child for a few hours, they play, we eat and do stuff together.

She expressed to me and some other parents how sad and upset she was about having to go back to work so soon and that she was stressed about leaving her daughter at preschool. She said that she wishes that she could be able to stay home as long as I planned, I said that it was possible. She told me that for them it wasn’t. I called bullshit on that, she obviously gets her hair colored, has makeup, trendy clothes and stuff like that.

	"body" : "My father is in his mid 70s, in declining health and has mobility issues. He walks at about half the speed of my mother, who is about the same age. He has trouble standing up after sitting for short periods and has physical ailments affecting his back and one of his feet. This is at least partly due to not doing any exercise for most of his life despite my occasional pestering (ironically he was a medical doctor before he retired).My father recently inherited a large sum of money - the interest it earns in a high yield savings account each year is more than my annual salary (and my income is in the top 2-3% of US households). Even without the inheritance, he is well off with an 8-figure net worth and lives frugally.He's taking a trip soon where he will be on a plane by himself. The flight will be 17+ hours one way and 15+ hours the other. I procured a business class ticket for him on miles in one direction, and we got into an argument over the ticket for the other direction. Business gives him a better seat, more space, and a bed to sleep on during the long flight.He refuses to buy a business ticket the other way because it's too expensive. I don't disagree with him that a business ticket is extremely expensive, but I believe he's at the stage where that kind of money simply doesn't matter, and his health matters more. He's in a privileged position where the added cost of the business ticket simply doesn't matter. He could lose $100K in a ditch and his life wouldn't change one single bit.His reasoning in his words: \"I was brought up in a different era and from young I was taught to be thrifty by my mother. Changing long standing habits is a challenging process and try as I may, I cannot bring myself to spend over $10000 on a single ticket\". He normally complains about his health issues but now is saying that his health isn't that bad & 17 hrs in economy was fine.I think he lacks perspective and he's a hypocrite about money (he doesn't manage his money at all and put the inheritance in a bank account that earned almost no interest for 6 months until I found out and did the work of opening a new high interest account and moving the money into it for him, my mother manages all their other finances). He raised me to work hard but I don't know what the point is if you can't also enjoy the fruits of your labor. He says I'll inherit the money when he dies so I should be happy he's not spending it, but I always told him that I'd honestly be happier if he spent the money on taking care of himself and enjoying life.Also, I'm an only child living abroad with my family and I'm increasingly resentful that he doesn't take care of himself. When he inevitably runs into serious health issues, I'm going to have to deal with it.After a heated argument on the phone, I got angry and gave him an ultimatum that if he flew economy, he could do it both ways and if he ran into any health problems on his trip he was on his own and I wasn't going to help.

He told me this morning he had found a bakery close to home that had come up on Google when looking for \"Hungarian food\", so we walked over there this morning.When we got to the bakery, I (33f) noticed that the sign outside said Turkish bakery. Cool, maybe he did some research and new of a specific item that overlapped?We go into the bakery and he asks the baker if they have any Hungarian items. Here's where he thinks I'm the asshole: my immediate reaction was shock and I said \"really?\" because I could not understand why you would go to a Turkish bakery and the first thing you ask is if they have Hungarian food. The baker quickly responded \"no, we only have Turkish food.\"We left after purchasing a few things, but as soon as we leave he gave me shit for making him feel so bad about asking. His rationale for going there was 1) it popped up in a Google search and 2) Turkey ruled Hungary 500 years ago so the food must have some influence or be similar??I'm prepared to accept judgement, so AITA?",

	"body" : "So for context my partner and I have been together for just under 2 years but we've known each other for around 10 years since going to college together.When we first started dating my MIL would introduce me to people excitedly about being part of the family and quote he'd \"daughter in law\" eventhough we are not married.Last year everything changed. In January I had a problem with my eyes where I had to go to hospital for serious migraines and blurred vision, when I told my partner (25M) about this he came straight home from work to look after my daughter (his now step daughter) without me asking. Thankfully the doctors didn't find anything seriously wrong and I regained full sight.Now since this incident my Mil scolded me and berated me for my partner coming home to take care of me and my daughter (he's in the army). Just the prefix, I didn't ask him to come home and he done it anyway saying that \"we are family\".I had a follow up appointment at the opticians where my MIL just so happened to be there and this is where she first berated me in front of a load of strangers. Now I told my partner about this straight away and he was furious with his mother and told me that he would talk to her about it. However when he went to meet her, he didn't bring it up and she reiterated that i should have called my family as a priority.Since this incident there have been a few times where my MIL has excluded me from family gatherings and is asking for lore 1 on 1 time with her son without myself and my daughter present.There has been a recent incident where I had to tell my MIL for overstepping one of mine AND my daughters boundaries and I have expressed this to my partner but says he now doesn't want to get involved.My MIL is now blaming any negative mood on going through menopause and saying she's having really low moments which is one of the reasons my partner isn't talking to her about me and accepting her current behaviour with our family.AITA for now being cautious about bringing my daughter and future child (I am currently pregnant) around my MIL with her behaviour as she's been actively excluding me and my daughter out of family get together and overstepping boundaries that have been expressed multiple times and over crossed.My partner is now saying he will not get involved because he doesn't want to upset his mother and be \"piggy in the middle\" when I have told him how much its upset me.",

While doing so I my brother asked what I was making from the other room I told him I was heating up Nutella. He got upset and asked if it was his, I was confused and unaware that he bought his own. My dad is the type of person who will buy things and then put them in the pantry randomly for us to have. So I assumed it’s be fine if I took some and this was after about a month or more of me starting to take form them. I will be the first to admit I do often take a lot, I had used about half of each container (what my brother said) of peanut butter and Nutella. When I told him I’m sorry I didn’t know it was his, he got more upset. He then said I’d have to pay for the peanut butter and Nutella. I then said he should label his food if he was going to put it in the pantry. I’m known for especially when I’m getting close to my period that I have a lot of chocolate. I will admit how I said it wasn’t the nicest of tone but I was upset that he was yelling at me. I also don’t have a job and have not a lot of money. I have about 50$ of my own physical money. I haven’t told my parents yet that this happened. Should I tell them? Was I the asshole? I’m just looking for some help with how to deal with this situation.update: So after reading talks comments I talked To my brother about it and i sayed that I could repay him if he wanted and he said he was just upset about me taking it without asking. I apologized and we talked it out. Thanks for y’alls advice and I realize now that I didn’t really take responsibility for what I did and we really both were just kinda upset at it during the moment. also buying my own chocolate it hard to do because I don’t have a job and as stated before i don’t have a lot of money to spend like that because im trying to save my money for after high school. But I did realize that i can afford to pay him back, I didnt realize that it was as cheap as it was, I was kinda in the moment and didnt think it throug.final update- I bought  my brother the new things after some delays due to life and what not and as suggested by one lovely person I did in fact write his name on the new onesfinal clarification- firstly I didn’t eat the nutella and peanut butter in one sitting as i may have suggeste, it was over multiple days in about a months time. Secondly I can’t buy my own chocolate, I am again 16 years old. Thirdly I stopped eating the nutella after my brother yelled at me and only touched it after I bought him a new and larger version for himself to use, I then left the peanut butter and nutella the was used in the pantry for our family to have for themselves. also the peanut it’s often mixed with the Nutella because for me that delicious and a nice treat",

TDLR, recently, we had to sterilise some plastic for our project. Usually, we use a machine called an autoclave to sterilise things. What the autoclave does is heat up to such a high degree that it kills everything alive including bacteria. As long as you put inanimate objects in an special autoclave bag, they will be sterilised and the autoclave will not affect it in any other way.Veronica decided to show up for the first time in weeks to a meeting today, and since she is quite clueless as to what’s going on, I told her to sterilise some products as it is a relatively simple, and straightforward process. We just throw the items into an autoclave bag, and then into the autoclave. She decided to go against my direct orders, stating that the autoclave will melt whatever we put inside. She instead decided to use isopropyl to sterilise the products we’re going to use. I told her not to as the isopropyl was HIGHLY dangerous to the live bio products we intent on using in our experiment, and we don’t have time to buy fresh, uncontaminated samples as our project is due in 3 days. I heard from one member on the team that she decided to use isopropyl behind my back anyways, and that everyone in the room tried to stop her as she was going against my direct orders and we have autoclaved everything in the past to test, and nothing melted. She wouldn’t listen to anyone. I sent the following message in the team groupchat:“YOU DISOBEYED MY DIRECT ORDERS TO NOT PUT IT IN EHTANOL. AS YOUR CAPTAIN I EXPECT YOU TO VALUE MY INPUT. YOUR ACTIONS SHOW PURE IGNORANCE AND IDIOCY. YOU HAVE POTENTIALLY JEOPARDISED THE ENTIRE EXPERIMENT WITH YOUT BIG ASS EGO AND REFUSAL TO LISTEN TO ANYONE BESIDES YOURSELF.

I told him I don’t want to do that, because what if I get a job in retail and then a couple months later I get a job in my field and then I have to quit.He shrugged and basically said there’s no issue with that. I told him that nobody would hire me if I told them that I’m actively looking for a different job, and he said that that probably won’t be a dealbreaker for most retail places since they understand if you’re in college you’re looking for better jobs and also that I don’t have to tell potential employers that I’m looking for work. I said that that’s kind of scummy, to work for a place and then ditch them as soon as you find something better.He said that that isn’t how it is, and that people leave jobs for plenty of reasons. He used himself as an example, saying that when he was in college he basically just job hopped to whoever was paying the most until he was qualified for a “résumé job”. I asked if his bosses knew he was just in it for the money and that he’d leave as soon as he got a better opportunity. He kind of fudged around before admitting that he wouldn’t make it clear to them and would just say whatever sounded best so they’d hire him.I was honestly a bit irked by this point and said that lying to your potential boss is definitely a scummy thing to do and that no offense to him but I didn’t want to take advice from someone like that. He shrugged and said then I shouldn’t have asked and said “good luck looking for work” in kind of a testy way. He’s been kind of frosty to me since then and it’s got me second guessing myself.

	"body" : "Me and my ex had been in a relationship for a little over a year before we went to college. We went to different colleges so the long distance really damaged our relationship as it was hard for us to see each other since neither of us had a car. After a few weeks of being in school, my girlfriend asked me if it would be ok to open the relationship since we weren’t able to see each other as often as we wanted to. I stupidly agreed thinking it wouldn’t be a problem. A note that my ex’s birthday is in late September and mine is in early October (not saying exact dates for privacy). We opened our relationship mid September. When her birthday came around, I bought her a few small gifts from Temu, 5 or 6 small silly items. We FaceTimed when the package arrived and she unboxed them and loved them. Time passes and we FaceTime each other when we can but I can tell she’s more distant and talking to other guys which is ok because we agreed to open the relationship. When my birthday comes around, no package arrives and my ex gives no indication of a present coming. I call her and we talk about our days and then I bring up my birthday asking if she got me anything. She says she has some things but hasn’t sent them yet, so I happily await a package for another week. It doesnt come. Thanksgiving break comes along and we meet up back in our hometown to discuss how our relationship is going. During our conversation, I ask her about my birthday gift and if she brought it with her from school. She says she forgot it in her dorm and she’ll send it as a Christmas present. A few weeks after thanksgiving, she breaks up with me because she met another guy at her college. I knew it would happen eventually and I really was in a bad state for a while. When Christmas came around we briefly started talking again. I told her that during Black Friday I had got her a small gift (some perfume from bed bath and beyond’s super sale) maybe hinting that she could get me something too. She had no present for me. I wasn’t all that surprised but I kind of expected something. When I gave her my gift and she didnt have anything for me I just stood there. I didn’t say anything or yell but I just felt sad. I understand that we weren’t in a relationship anymore but she could’ve gotten me something. Or at least given me the gift she had already bought for me for my birthday. Am I the asshole for expecting a gift from my ex?Just to clarify, I am 20 male and my ex is 19 female",

We embarked on the IVF journey a few years ago and found out we were expecting twin girls.Months ago, we had already settled on what we thought were adorable names: Jameson Katherine and Michelle Emily, with the super cute nicknames Jay and Elle. I thought we had nailed it! However, there's a little 'joke' that I've kept to myself- if you include their middles they have the nickname potential of Jay Kay and Elle Em (JKLM). I had seen this as something to make the naming process a bit more fun and to make the twins feel connected without being overly matchy.But, as it turns out, my wife didn't quite see the humor in it. She noticed it and brought it up to me today. I told her it was intentional, and she absolutely blew up on me, accusing me of not taking our roles as soon-to-be parents seriously. According to her, I'm making light of an important decision and not respecting the gravity of the situation.So, am I the asshole here, or is my wife just channeling her inner drama queen? I mean, it's not like I named the kids after my favorite sports team or suggested 'Jenny Talia'.",

When my sister came to stay with us she wasn't very well, mentally or physically. The doctors had told her she was borderline diabetic. I decided that we could work out together and eat healthier. I also decided to quit smoking. During this time we were going through 2kg of sugar a fortnight. My ex and I used to joke and say she must have been getting into the sugar not nice I know. I was drinking tea to help me stop smoking which really did help btw, but would have a sugar substitute. Found out my sister was putting sugar in my tea when she made them for me. She disclosed that she had being doing it on purpose to see how much sugar she could put in before I noticed. Obviously I was quite upset when she said that and was pissed off about it for quite awhile.A few years ago my sister said that she was sorry and that it really upsets her when I bring it up. After a long conversation about it, I apologised for bringing it up and said that I would let it go. I haven't brought it up since.Now, My sister and her daughter have been spending a lot of time with us and came up and spent Christmas with our family we have a new baby. My sister sent me a weird text saying that she was talking to my other sister who is a narcissist and that she wouldn't be talking about anything negative about family this year. I told her she can talk to whomever she likes.A few weeks later she rang me, I told her I wasn't in a good mood as I was tired from the kids and that I was a bit hurt by the way the message was worded. She stated that she is working things out and just doesn't know who to trust, and that she loves all her sisters. I said that I know she won't listen to me after she has been told by two psychologists who told her to cut her out already. I was angry and said it isn't that hard to know who to trust. She then brought up the tea thing and said that I went on about it, says that she feels the same thing about me as she does with my other sister. I was pissed off, I said wtf. I said why are you bringing that up now. I said that looking back I was justified to go on about it since she had tried to make me fat. She then denied that she said she did it on purpose.

Only 2 of the 3 live in my state unfortunately and those are the 2 I'm having problems with.We'll call them Coal (18 nb) and Brit (19 nb). Brit  and Coal both just got out of relationships. Coal was cheated on and Brit cheated. They are both really desperate to hop back into a new relationship and have been on tinder. Now we live in a large city so there are LOTS of options and yet they matched with each other. They've met a few times through me but don't know each other very well so they both asked me if it was a good idea. I have known Brit since we were 5 and a briefly dated Coal in Highschool (we're still very good friends nothing weird between us) so I know them both very well and more importantly I know how they both behave in relationships so I know FOR A FACT this will end absolutely terribly and they will both get their feelings hurt. So I told them that I thought it was a very bad idea and furthermore that being caught in the middle of their breakup( Coal especially likes to make their romantic drama my problem) would make me extremely uncomfortable but that they are grown ups and have to make their own choices.Obviously they both ignored my advice in favor of their own horny nonsense. I AGAIN expressed how awful of an idea this is and my discomfort with this to Coal but I also told them how desperately I don't want to be involved. They apologized for being an ass and then proceeded to PUT THE 3 OF US IN A GROUP CHAT \"because we needed to talk it out\" which I would argue is the opposite of not involving me.I just restated what I'd already said and that I didn't wanna be involved to which Brit said it sounds like I just think they're emotionally immature.

I'm a momma to a precious 16-month-old, and he's got some adorable mixed-race features. My husband is from an Asian country, and our little baby has a beautiful slightly tanned skin and amazing Asian features with some really big eyes. Now, few days ago, I found myself in a bit of a situation with an old gamma of another kid – let's call her Granny Gossip (GG) – and I need your opinions on this one.GG has made a few comments before about how \"exotic\" and \"beautiful\" my baby is. I don’t mind those comments because he is really cute, and by now, I’m used to hearing those. I often just agree and move on with whatever I’m doing. But lately, she is starting to feel a bit much.The issue started last week. I'm picking up my little one when GG strikes up a friendly chat… fine so far. The teacher comes and puts my son on the floor so he can walk towards me. Suddenly, GG gets in front of me and makes signals for my baby to go to her. I was shocked at first, but I gently pushed her a bit aside and picked up my kid. She appeared to be annoyed, but I shut down any attempts of complaint by cordially, but firmly, stating that I was the mother and she has no business doing what she just did.Fast forward to this week, and guess what? GG is at it again, making comments about my baby's looks, but after last week’s incident, I didn’t entertain her at all. When my kid comes, anyone would have thought that she got the message, but it seems like she missed the memo. This time, I wasn't as polite – I walked right up to her, and I admit that I said some choice words, along with a clear message that my son has nothing to do with her. She's not the mother nor the grandma, and she has absolutely no business trying to attract the attention of my kid like that, even more in front of me.Some might say I'm being oversensitive, but I reckon it's my right as a momma to set some boundaries. My husband is with me, but he thinks that I could have handled things better. Also, I have seen other parents giving me a judgmental look. So, AITA for telling GG to back off and let my baby arc himself towards his momma, not towards her?",

I noticed she was hanging out with this guy (M17) a lot. At first I figured they were just friends and hanging out bc they were close. They have been friends for a while before me and her met and I knew about him. But then he came over every day driving 45 minutes to hang out with her. I should note we are in college and live across the street from each other. Well I think a lot of it and try to ignore it. But a few days ago I found out they were dating for about a week already we broke up two weeks ago. I was upset because she told me these exact words “you were my best person” “it’s gonna be a whole to move on from you and I’m gonna take a break from dating” so I was very upset bc I felt betrayed and lied to. Then things got worse after I found out they were together I tried to ignore her a lot. Then she snapped me saying “how would you feel if I told you I was talking to someone” I was upset but said “I wouldn’t give a flying fk” she said “jeez alr well he has a thing about me talking to my exs” one thing to note is when we were together and I had an issue with it and she didn’t unadd her exs for me. While I was upset I kept cool and said “ok and?” She proceeded to call me an ahole and say “I just wanted to let you know I’m unadding you and you can still text my number bc I care about you. I said “I’m not being an asshole and ok” and unadded her first.This is where the fun begins. I found out her and her new man are being intimate. The issues at hand are. He’s 17 and she is about to be 21 soon. Which ok wtv but however our relationship she never wanted any kind of intimacy and she said she wanted to wait til marriage. Now this is my fault bc she told me “I’ve had intimacy with all my other relationships and want to wait bc sx ruins relationships” which I said ok which was stupid of me. Either way I rant to my friends about it and they say don’t be petty we’ll do it for you they put on instagram notes “17 is a weird number” and “1+7=21 right?” Obviously targeting her but not really She proceeded to blow up my phone asking me why they said those things and that it’s my fault. They both had reasons ready and I said idk ask them bc I can’t read their minds. But in a very mean way. She proceeded to try to make me out to be an ahole and call me a dck and say I’m acting like a 5 year old. I ignored it and left it alone. She texted me again and I sent a photo of my friend doing a kissy face to make her mad. Then I sent a whole paragraph going off on her and telling her to leave me alone. So AITA",

As we headed to the exit we stopped for the restroom and a diaper change.The exit level has 1 family restroom with a toilet and a diaper change station, a women’s restroom with 6 stalls and no diaper change stations, and a men’s room also with no diaper change stations.We’ve been on other occasions and I’ve waited in lines for the family restroom before, as well as lines within the women’s restroom.As I approached, my husband was still a little behind me with our toddler, and there was no one waiting at the family room, so I headed inside alone and did my business, and texted my husband to bring our girl to the door so I could change her after I was finished.As I was washing my hands, I could hear a female voice outside saying something like “I saw her go in, it’s just a single lady”.I opened the door, saw my husband, beckoned to him to bring our daughter over, and she ran inside to me. As she came over, a woman standing right outside the door holding a baby said, “Seriously! We’ve been waiting!”I replied, “I understand, I’ve waited too, we’ll be done soon.”She called me a rude name, and I said “we’re all just doing the best for our families, I’m trying to be quick.”I closed the door and changed my toddler, not making it take any longer than necessary. While we were inside, I could hear the woman continuing to comment on how selfish and ignorant she thought I was being. As we walked out, she again called me a rude name. I walked straight out without commenting or making eye contact.I thought I was being efficient by going in first, and I don’t realistically think it took any longer than if my daughter and I had been inside together the whole time. I can see the view that we had “two turns” inside while another family was waiting. Maybe I should have used the women’s room myself, then waited to separately use the family room just for the diaper change, but that simply seemed like an unnecessary extra step at the time. Since I was carrying the diaper bag, my husband couldn’t have changed her simultaneously unless we had switched in advance and, again, it didn’t occur to me since I knew my daughter and I could both use the family restroom. I guess I could have waited at the family restroom for them to catch up and not gone in until we were together, I just thought in the moment since I was a bit ahead that I would be faster to just go myself first, instead of waiting for her to enter the room together.AITA?",

So I assume that would mean he would get home 5:15 to 5:30, right? I guess not because he consistently gets home 6 or later most days. Today I got off early. I was excited because we have no days off together and this meant we would have a little more evening time, assuming he was off at 5 like her keeps saying. I got home at 5:30 only to find out he was still at work. So I called and asked what time he was off. He flipped out and said 5. I said then why are you still at work? He said because he has to close the office, pick up stuff, close the gate, etc. I said then you're still working, so when are you off so I know when you'll be home? I was looking for a answer that would set up realistic expectations going forward. Like \"I have to do x, y, and z but I can't do that until 5 so 5:30 is a more realistic time to say I'm off.\" Pretty much we argued back and forth for a minute with me insisting if he's off at 5 then it's not crazy to expect him home by 5:30 and him arguing that he is off at 5 and he's just locking up for 30 min to an hour. He then asked me if I'm off 6 why I don't get home until 7. I said because my commute is an hour, but I still leave at six.  He keeps insisting this is the same logic. He ended up getting home at 6 and has been ignoring me for an hour and a half because he's busy with his game and insists I need to apologize for asking him what time he is off again. Which I did, and tried to explain that I keep expecting him home based off what he told me and keep getting disappointed. Which just started another argument.So AITA for thinking he should be home 15 to 30 min after he's \"off.\" I could be because maybe I should have just asked what time he was getting home instead of what time he is off again. I'm just tired of being told one thing and then something else happening.Edit: Phew... A lot of you are weirdly triggered by this.  I can see how my post comes across as me being wildly unhinged but I wasn't even the slightest bit upset until he blew up at me when my intention was to just figure out what was going on and I did not do a good job of communicating that to him.Regardless, I apologized for asking him what time he was off hours ago and for not understanding that he had a completely different interpretation of the question than I did. I kept all attempts to explain where I was coming from to myself. And because I have not attempted to talk out the miscommunication  again he is happily talking to me instead of ignoring me.",

When Annie was going to college, she got an offer from her dream college.Unfortunately they didn’t offer enough financial aid that meant it was viable for her to attend, so she settled for her backup, still an Ivy League, but she was upset for sometime about not being able to attend her dream college. At the time, me and my husband couldn’t support her at the dream school as we had crazy overhead costs. We did contribute what we can, but asked Annie to work part time.Even after the financial aid, Annie worked a job to go towards her rent and this has meant her studies suffered. She had to defer some of her classes to sit them in the summer. She has now since graduated and landed a good job.Ben wasn’t fussed about where he got into and he did well at high school, and got a full ride scholarship, so we didn’t pay for his tuition. Occasionally I sent him money to spend on himself.Cal is my youngest and as its been a few years since Annie went to college, me and my husband are in a better financial position to support where he wants to go. Cal got many offers and picked his first choice. He was eligible for some financial aid, but the majority will be out of pocket. As we didn’t contribute for Ben’s tuition, we are able to send Cal to a more prestigious school.When Cal announced this news at a family dinner, Annie got upset that Cal gets to go to his dream school and accused us of favourites. I tried explaining the situation was different, we can afford it now, as we didn’t pay for Ben so can use it on Cal. We set aside equal 1/3rds for the kids, but as our kids have grown, our savings for the youngest two have increased. AITA?eta- We did sponsor some on Annie’s masters program cost. So in my head",

	"title" : "AITA for hating the way my partner plays video games?",
	"body" : "I have played video games with my partner ever since we first met. We’ve played so many games, even if I didn’t like them. I did this so that I could get close to my partner more and try to take an interest in what they play. The only problem is I despise the way they play.Say we start a game together that neither of us have played, I take the classic route of learning as we go. I enjoy the mystery and figuring things out for myself and doing it the way I have ever since I’ve started video games. They take the route of researching how to do everything to do with the game, gaining all the knowledge possible and (in my opinion) ruining it for themself. I see it as slightly cheating, because they get a running head-start and then end up taking the lead and doing everything for themself. I really loved Baldur’s Gate until they started telling me where to go and what to do and letting me fall into their knowledge and spoiling everything for me. I ended up just following them around for the entirety of our play through because I felt stupid for not having picked up the knowledge they did.Another thing is modding games. They love to add mods that make the games easier or better for them to play. Adding OP equipment or spells which just makes everything too easy to do.I don’t want to research and they don’t want to go in blind, but I ended up having an argument with them over it and called them a “cheater” for the way they played. They told me to explain how it’s cheating and I said “You don’t get to play the game the way they want you to play. You’d get a lot more out of it for going in blind.” They were very angry about that part, but I genuinely don’t know what to do. Now I feel like an asshole for even bringing it up. They spoil games for me and themselves. It just seems our gaming styles are way too separate. I fully understand if you want to do that in single player stuff, it’s your choice and you’re not affecting anyone, but I just really disagree with the way they do it.Am I the asshole?",

My bf asked his stepmom to plan it instead, and she did an amazing job I’m beyond grateful she stepped up when she didn’t have to and I’m grateful for everything everyone got for the baby)Yesterday was the baby shower, I was already sad because my dad wasn’t able to attend but I did my best to not let that affect my day. My bfs family showed up and gave him hugs and greeted him. I’m standing right where everyone is coming to say hi to his family but everyone either just gave me an awkward hug or walked by without saying anything. I did my best to brush it off but after 2 hours of no one saying “hi” to me or even trying to make conversation I wanted to cry but there was 2 more hours left that was literally spent of just his family talking to each then last 5 minutes was opening gifts.After the shower was over I tried to tell my bf that I’m upset his family didn’t acknowledge me the whole time, he says they’re just antisocial people and I should have made more of an effort to talk to them. I agree I should have made more of an effort but I tried to say hi to everyone who came and they chose to only talk to him.Again I’m grateful people came, got stuff for the baby, and that my bf got to see his family. I’m upset because I felt excluded. I started balling on the ride home because after I told my bf how I was feeling he says “well I only went for the stuff” and making little comments like “I’m sorry you think my family is trash” “why does everything have to be bad, look at all the stuff we didn’t have to pay for” it got to the point I was sobbing just begging him to stop because I just wanted him to comfort me but it felt like he was rubbing it in that he doesn’t care his family acknowledged him and he kept bringing it back to the stuff.This morning I was scrolling through socials to see pictures of only my bf and his family from the baby shower and it hurts all over again.Now I’m an adult and I’m not going to let how this event went impact how I feel about them because they’re nice people and I made sure I didn’t let my emotions get the best of me during the baby shower so my bf could have fun but AITA for being upset?",

Our agreement was my 2 other friends would pay for the cruise ($2100) and I would pay for all drinks. I agreed and figured it was a fair agreement.I had even said it’s no problem if you guys buy a few drinks for girls, like no problem. But here is where the issue lies. My friends didn’t just buy drinks for a few or even 10-15 girls. They literally bought drinks for entire groups of people. For an entire week. This total added up to $5k roughly. Not a single time did they ask or imply this would be the case.Now it’s not breaking the bank to pay this. My issue is my co workers were “ballers” for this entire cruise and I feel taken advantage of. When they asked me to pay this, I told them to get fucked. Like are you kidding. They are saying this was our agreement and I am not living up to it.Maybe I am just weary of people taking advantage of me given my own nature of knowing people behave like this. But I’m just not buying that things got out of hand and this wasn’t intentional.My friend also refused to pay this and it’s going to collections. Now all I hear for days is his credit score his credit score blah blah blah. I really don’t care. But should I just pay this to make it go away? It’s against my principles and them 2 are saying I’m being a huge dick. If that’s the consensus here I’ll pay it. But I just needed some other opinions. Thanks for reading",

	"body" : "I'm (17f) and have a little sister named Asia (14f)Asia had a bunny called Hay. She did take good care of it, at least from what I can tell. It had a cage that took up an entire wall of our room and chew toys and whatever else rabbits need or like.Anyways, Asia lets it run around in our fenced in backyard. Here comes a big issue.I'm really into gardening and house plants. I keep a couple big leafy plants on my side of our room and I have a mini-garden in our backyard that I'm really proud of because I put so much time and effort into keeping it. My favorite ones are my snap-dragons.So naturally, Hay fucking gets into all my plants. I'm usually able to catch it before it does damage but it ripped an entire leaf off my ficus and whenever Asia lets it outside, guess where it runs straight to. My garden and the little fucker will start digging and messing it up. Once again, usually I chase after it or yell at Asia to get it tf away from my flowers but still it constantly happens and it was so frustrating.A few days ago I was working outside, and Asia was on the other side of the backyard playing with Hay. Our mom calls her in and tells her it's time to leave for her dentist appointment and Asia asks if I minded watching it for a few minutes and then putting it back in it's cage because she was in a hurry. I said fine, and she left.By that point I was pretty dehydrated so I went inside to get a drink and cut up an apple (at that point I was even gonna offer it some) and when I come outside it was digging around and fucking destroying my garden. I screamed and ran over to it and tossed Hay away from my garden. I was sobbing while trying to salvage was was left away from it I couldn't think of anything else.I put in so much effort just to watch it get destroyed in front of me. Some snapdragons and petunias were able to be saved but Hay trampled over a lot and bent their stems. After a while I realized I should probably look for Hay and bring it back inside. I then realized I couldn't find it anywhere. I looked everywhere and panicked but then I realized that there were some gaps under our wooden fence that it could've slipped under and it was too late.When my mom and Asia got home I explained what happened and Asia burst into tears and screamed at me. She asked me why I didn't just bring it inside if I wasn't gonna watch it and I told her I had other thing to worry about since her fucking rabbit destroyed my garden. She cried and said her rabbit was dead now. I said that was dumb because it's probably fine since there are plenty of wild rabbits and the only thing dead were my flowers.She ran away and said she wasn't talking to me and stormed into our room and I started going off and said it was unfair to treat me like this because if she just trained her fucking animal NONE of this would've happened.My mom said she isn't picking a side but she still refuses to talk to me and its fucking dumb.So AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for Using the Laundry Machine Too Much?",
	"body" : "This morning one of my roommates messaged in the group chat about our electricity bill being high. In the summer months, it's typically around $35. This month it was around $68. For reference, that is cheaper than last year, when we paid around $102. She said that she doesn't shower or do laundry much so she doesn't know why it could be high. Water is not included in our utility bill, but rather our rent, so I said that. I realize now that the laundry machine can use a lot of electricity, I just didn't consider that because we have a washer that claims to be efficient. Also, it's been very cold where we live. I said it's probably just the heating.Onto the issue at hand. I do about 6 loads of laundry a week: Towels, bedding, white clothes, athletic clothes, colors, and jeans. Maybe one extra load if I spill something on myself. By comparison, this roommate who messaged about the electricity bill does laundry maybe once a week. She never washes her sheets and towels. She's asked me once before why I do so much laundry, so I explained to her its because of my allergies. I'm literally allergic to dust so I have to wash my sheets and towels weekly, otherwise I get itchy. I also said that I do so many independent loads of laundry because I wash according to manufacturer directions. I spend a lot of money on my clothes so I want to keep them nice for a really long time, as to not waste money.I try to do my loads when no one else is in the house. If I plan on doing a bunch of loads back to back, I typically ask if anyone needs to use the machine before I start hogging it.Honestly I'm kind of peeved about her bringing this up, because she really isn't a great roommate. She consistently forgets to lock the door and turn off the stove. She and her boyfriend will cook until midnight at least three times a week (I have no issue with her using the kitchen, but she's very loud when she does it). She also leaves the kitchen a mess and doesn't do her dishes for days, making it really difficult to use the sink. She also goes out Thursday, Friday, and Saturday- which is fine, I'm glad she has free time - but its quite annoying when she comes back at 2 am and wakes me up by slamming the front door. She also doesn't contribute to any of the cleaning supplies unless specifically asked, and never restocks them herself because she doesn't have a car.The way that I view it, there's always give and take when you live with roommates. No one is perfect. Given I haven't actively been screaming at her about dishes and being loud, I feel that it's kind of unfair that she's complaining about my laundry usage.AITA?",

I replied that I needed my work clothes washed and it would just be one load. I didn't really see what the big issue was since if it was urgent clothes she could have put those in before this load and that my load isn't a huge one, she just needs to wait like an hour tops for it to be done. Not to mention I waited half an hour for her to do anything with her load. She doesn't have work either so she could wash whatever whenever she wants to while I don't have much time for myself to do this.She was pretty angry and yelling at me when I came to put my clothes in the drier and she had even put my clothes in the drier the moment it finished since I came to check in when my timer went off on my phone which made me think she put it in before the wash was finished. I found it a bit ironic she'd put my clothes in the dryer immediately without waiting a second for me to do it myself but didn't say anything and just walked away and grabbed my clothes from the drier before my timer finished about 5 minutes earlier than the timer was.

I (30F) recently got married to my wonderful husband Larry (33M), and our wedding went perfectly except for one thing.  Larry has two older siblings: Candace (38F) and Orlando (40M), and he's very close to them.  He also has several cousins, most of whom he likes.  He has a cousin, Susan (38F), who's married to Gabriel (39M).  Larry thinks that Susan has undiagnosed autism due to her difficulties in social situations and inability to maintain eye contact.  Candace and Orlando agree with this assessment.  Apparently she was never diagnosed because her younger brother Brad, 35M, had high-maintenance ADHD that required a lot of their parents' attention when they were younger, so Susan didn't get as much attention.  I'd met Susan once at a large family function before our wedding and she was very nice, but I didn't get a chance to know her better because there were so many people.  Brad is super nice as well, and I've gotten to know him better because he and his wife live closer to us.  Brad also thinks that Susan might have autism.Anyway, when Larry and I were doing seat arrangements for our wedding, we ended up with several tables that only had two spots available, so we had to split up larger parties.  We put Brad and his wife at a table with other cousins their age, as Larry thought Brad would get along with everyone better.  We put Susan and Gabriel at a table with older relatives, as Larry thought Susan would be more comfortable there.Throughout the reception, Brad and his wife had a great time socializing, whereas Susan didn't.  Every time she'd try to go socialize with them, the other cousins would be polite but would talk around her about things that didn't include her, so she felt left out.  Susan and Gabriel eventually just left the reception halfway through the evening, but no one noticed her absence for several hours.  It wasn't until we were doing final photos at the end of the evening that someone thought to look for Susan, couldn't find her, and then texted her to ask her where she'd gone.  She simply said that she and Gabriel had left earlier. Everyone got upset that she didn't tell anyone she'd left, and Larry was mad that she ruined our final photos by disappearing.Here's where I might be TA: I texted Susan that it was no wonder everyone thought she had autism when she acted like this.  She responded by blocking everyone's phone numbers and has been off the grid since then.  Now Brad is saying that I'm TA for 'outing' our opinions of her when we could've just kept it quiet, but I was upset that Susan had caused such a fuss at my wedding.  AITA?",

Recently, we attended the funeral service of one of his best friends since high school, and during the service, Paul kissed the coffin. Not many people seemed to notice, and I thought it was a nice gesture, but I was kinda weirded out. He approached me and looked at me, saying, “What’s that face about?” and I just whispered, “Oh nothing, I just think that was kinda awkward, unusual” Paul just gave me a smile and kept walking with teary eyes.I know funerals are highly emotional events so I didn’t mention anything else after that and I didn’t meant to directly judge his behaviour.The next day, during a casual conversation with a couple of our group friends, I mentioned to one particular friend that I thought Paul kissing the coffin was kinda weird but sweet in retrospective, not really thinking much about it, just as a recounting of the previous day. One of our mutual friends overheard us and said, “I don’t think that’s weird; it was our last time to say goodbye right?” and that she thought it was a touching moment. At that point, everyone joined the conversation, and one of the other friends was like, “Oh buddy!!!” and gave my boyfriend a big hug. I added, “Yeah, I said it was sweet but not something you see every day, isn't it?” and everyone got all quiet.My boyfriend seemed a little uncomfortable. He said, \"Please, let’s change the subject.\" we did but after that, he kinda zoned out and left earlier than we had planned for that day. This was almost two weeks ago, and we're still talking like usual, but I don’t want to keep bothering our friends over this, and I'd rather not bother Paul since he’s still grieving. My sister thinks I was wrong to express my thoughts at that moment and that kissing a closed casket or coffin is not really that unusual, and I should leave it alone.I know that writing a Reddit post is the opposite of leaving it alone, but some of our mutual friends told me I was being very obnoxious that day with Paul by bringing up the subject. So, I guess I need to know from more perspectives if I was indeed an a-hole for mentioning what I was thinking.Perhaps it's a cultural thing because I was raised in Germany, and he’s French, but I don’t believe I was rude for simply bringing it up! Maybe I lack funeral service etiquette?EDIT:  I knew his friend too, and he was a great guy and an amazing person all around. Just so you know I’m also grieving in a way",

Sam told Peter, who approached me during school. He asked me if I really had a crush on him. I tried to stall but eventually said yes. He said something like \"Sorry bro I'm straight\" and walked away. It wasn't how I wanted him to find out, especially considering that we were surrounded by classmates.

It seems that they shared it with others too and it eventually reached Peter. He did not mention it to me at all so I had no idea.Later, I confronted Peter about insulting me behind my back in front of a teacher, which he vehemently denied, even though many of my friends could bear witness. He changed the topic and told the teacher that I had spread the screenshot of that convo which I shouldn't have done because it was embarrassing, and it should've been kept private.

Let's call her 'Jenny' for simplicity's same. We have been friends for 6 years.Jenny is very extroverted and likes.to be occupied every weekend. I'm more ambivalent, leaning towards introverted. I enjoy having more alone time or hanging out at friend's houses. We are both overweight, though her a bit less than me.Usually, we compromise and find something to do we both enjoy. I will attend events she throws for specific reasons (like birthdays) even if they aren't necessarily things that I enjoy or would do otherwise because she's my friend and I love her. We went on a road trip last year for her birthday and ended up going to a museum and escape room all in the same day.Recently, she has started a new job and is now working with my mom. They have gotten close and chat often.December and January have been incredibly busy months with things every single weekend. I have done something in each of them. I even went to Jenny's house one Friday after work to drink wine and eat cheese, even though I don't really drink wine.Jenny has been planning her birthday party for months. At first, she wanted to do a scooter trip for her birthday, similar to what we did last year. Since the timing didn't work out for other travels and things, we were going to do this scooter trip in April when there's a long weekend despite her birthday being in February. She has since decided to also do something on her actual birthday.She's planning to go go-karting, ice-skating, mini-golfing, and karaoking all on the same day in another city. However, I can't attend all of those events due to a foot injury I sustained a year ago. I informed her of this and while she was trying to convince me otherwise at first, it seemed like we reached a compromise that worked for both of us. I just wouldn't attend all of the events.Apparently, I was wrong. She ended up using her new relationship with my mom to complain about me not wanting to go out and do things. She is now incredibly concerned about my physical and mental health, because physically I'm incapable of doing certain activities. (I broke my foot a year ago from a work-related fall. My weight has nothing to do with it). She's apparently planning on book an appointment with a therapist for me and surprising me with it (she is paying). The catch is, she has NEVER once brought up any of these concerns with me. She's never communicated her alleged concern to me in the 6 years we've been friends.I'm hurt and upset and now do not want to attend her birthday festivities at all. I know being direct with her doesn't work. She makes up excuses, or tries to emotionally blackmail me. The most drama-free solution is to simply fake an illness. We have the same friend group, so just cutting her off wouldn't be plausible. Would I be the asshole for going this route?",

	"body" : "For context I (25F) have been living with my roommate (29M) for 2.5 years now. We both wanted to adopt a cat for so long and finally I rescued one named Sunny about a year ago. Sunny was the sun we needed in our lives and we love him so much. I adopted him from a really bad owner so he fell in love with us too.About six months ago our mutual friend told us her brother and his wife are splitting up and giving away their two kittens. Their marriage was psychologically abusive for years now and they bought the kittens for a last resort before ending their marriage. Since they cannot take care of the kittens alone (because they also have two kids together) they decided to sell the kittens to someone. We were struggling financially so we could not buy the cats. But our friend loved the cats so much that she wanted the cats to go to a house she knows. She persuaded her brother, and since he could not sell them at that time, he agreed to give the cats to us.After that we had three cats to take care of and it put us in a binding spot financially. Since Thunder and Cloud (the kittens we adopted) were British shorthair, they were getting sick constantly. Especially Thunder, because he was a pure breed. I was afraid we were neglecting the kittens and begged him to give them away to someone. He finally agreed to give Cloud away to our other friend. But we were still fighting about the kittens and I was afraid something was gonna happen. There was also a possibility that he would go abroad to work and wanted to bring the cats with him. I told him that Thunder could not go abroad, because he could not withstand the drugs they give himon the plane and he is most definitely not bringing Sunny with him anywhere. Because Sunny and I went through so many hardships. We got into a fight again.Couple of weeks ago, Thunder started throwing up everywhere and he could not eat anything. My roommate told me he is gonna bring him to a vet. And I lashed out then and there again. I asked him, with what money are you gonna get him treated, and I told him his love for him is killing the kitten. Thunder seriously needs some surgeries that we cannot afford. I found a couple of good people who would adopt Thunder but he most definitely says that he cannot give him away. I suspect that he is loving this kitten so much because Thunder is an expensive cat and Sunny isn't. The thing is he is making me out to be a bad guy because I don't love Thunder and treating him bad. Me and my roommate don't spend that much time together at home (because of the work hours) so he doesn't see it when I'm playing with both of them. To him, I'm heartless and cruel to want to give Thunder away. So am I the asshole for telling my friend we should give away our cat?tldr; My roommate and I cannot afford two kittens and their vet expenses, so I think we should give one of them away. But he calls me heartless and cruel. AITA?edit:parahraph breaks",

There is never a day where she’ll come to class sober.So I think y’all can imagine the type of person she is and how terrible she is to work with.

	"body" : "So I will try to keep this short. The other day I hung out with a couple of friends we went out to grab some food before heading to a bar.We went to this sandwich place and my friend ordered himself a very large sandwich and a large soda. He ate about 85% of the sandwich but there was still at least 3-4 bites left on it. He tossed the rest of it away. To be fair he asked us is any of us wanted it. But we declined. I said no because the idea of eating someone else’s food grossed me out. He also got the large drink which was a dollar more but he could have opted for the smaller one and just gotten free refills. But he just didn’t want to get up.Anyways we left the sandwich shop and we began to walk and he reached into his pocket and grabbed his change, the coins and literally tossed them on the sidewalk. I was taken aback. I asked him why he did that and he said he doesn’t like change because it weighs his pants down and he hates carrying coins. I told him he can’t do that and he said of course he can he just did and always does.While at the bar I couldn’t let it go and told him he was insane. That if he tossed out $.50 cents everyday he was wasting well over a hundred dollars a year. He said he didn’t care and said if I am that desperate for money I can go pick it up. The rest of the night was awkward. He kept insisting on buying me beers even though I have money. He did it to rub it in my face. At the end of the night I flat out told him he was irresponsible and stupid and his arrogance was gross considering how many people struggle just to stay afloat.I told my girlfriend and she said I was harsh and confrontational for no reason.

	"title" : "AITA for asking my husband to cook food more to my taste?",
	"body" : "I (37f) asked my husband (40m) to cook food that I like and have been buying ingredients more aligned to what I want to eat. He says IATA because I complained. Backstory is we have a baby 8mo. The last year and a half he’s been doing all the cooking because I was pregnant and working a lot, recovering from a hard birth and struggling with breastfeeding the baby. The issue is not that he is upset about doing all the cooking. He’s upset that I complained and bought different food. For example, I asked him not to make anymore plain pasta and peppers with sausage because we’ve eaten it so many times times, and I bought food to make quiche because that’s something I like and miss cooking. I might be TA because this sounds ungrateful, but I just miss cooking myself and making foods that I like. I simply don’t have time because I do more baby care. I had him look this over so it isn’t biased. So, AITA?EDIT: Just to clarify, his dad is a very involved father and overall amazing husband. We’ve tried to switch off and have me do cooking, but our baby wants to breastfeed almost constantly in the evening because he “tanks up” and sleeps 9pm-6am (yes, we have an amazing baby). I cannot just “pump” as some have suggested because I would need to pump every time he eats to keep up my milk supply. I am a “just enougher”. We both do not want me to give up breastfeeding just to cook as it’s better for the baby.Another edit: My husband is a better cook than I am. He just likes different food and we’ve had a lot of repeats due to staying in a budget (as you all know food is ). I did try to buy food I like and send him recipes and he likes to cook the food he likes to cook. Also, some of you really don’t seem to understand the commitment and time that breastfeeding a baby takes. It’s a lot of time! We both work full time, and feeding the baby takes me 3.5+ hours on weekends and 2+ on days he is at daycare for most of the day. That doesn’t include the time I pump right before bed when his dad is putting him to bed. Breastfeeding and pumping is a full time job.Hopefully last edit: My husband wants everyone to know that his repertoire has been limited by little freezer space (I made a breast milk stash just in case), food is super expensive/he’s been trying to stay in budget, and he’s making sure I get the right nutrients for the baby. He also thinks I could have asked more nicely and the way I said it sounded like criticism. I own that. Maybe I am slightly TA.More: Wow. I’m sad to see so much judgement for our feeding choices, which was not an issue here at all. Neither of us feel it’s worth me cooking to do less for our baby. And yes, I am a former low supplier and exclusive pumper who worked my ass off to put milk aside in the freezer (waking up at 3 am) just in case my supply drops again and currently I can pump just enough while at work, but have been advised by lactation consultants that if I supplement with my stash my supply will drop again and I should keep it for emergencies until he’s closer to a year. All this has nothing to do with what my husband is cooking. For those of you saying just pump and bottle feed, I do not respond to a pump like a baby and that would actually take more time than breastfeeding. Not everyone can just pump for 20 mins and get a lot. My breastfeeding journey has been very very challenging but we’re committed to it and in no way think it would be worth changing so I can cook different food. That’s just not worth it.So: People still insisting we could trade off. That’s exactly what we tried to do with the quiche. I bought the stuff for quiche, I attempted to make the quiche while he watched the baby. Baby is starving in the evening and was screaming for me. Husband had to take over making the quiche and was not happy because it’s not something he usually makes and feels comfortable making, despite being a good and experienced cook. So we’ve accepted that he has to do the cooking.",

Before that we were long distance and I used to send her flowers for special occasions and sometimes just because. I often spent a good deal of money on a dozen roses. She was very grateful and would say how when she looked at them it reminded her of me and made her smile. It might be worth noting she never brought me flowers, but that didn't bother me as its a bit of a girly thing (no judgement or whatever, but honestly I could care less about flowers).Anyway, now to the issue at hand. Since living together I haven't brought her flowers - honestly I hadn't really thought to, because I'm right here in the same flat and so she doesn't need a reminder of me. Well just before Christmas she brought a Christmas flower arrangement, which I figured was just part of decorating for christmas. Early January she threw it out, and in its place appeared another vase of flowers, which I didn't say anything about because she was not working (she's a private school teacher and was off for their Christmas holidays) and I figured she's just bored. But I guess they died and now there's another vase of flowers in its place, and this time it's a dozen roses!I asked her what was up with the roses, and she said she likes flowers and that as I never buy her them anymore she has decided to get them for herself. I didn't say anything at the time but this has really got to me questioning her. It seems really passive aggressive to go out and buy roses for yourself just to make a point (literally identical to the arrangements I brought for her!). And now every time I walk into the kitchen I am hit with how shitty a boyfriend she thinks I am.Edit: I appreciate the comments, even though some of them were hard to swallow.It seems the jury is split, I’m either an unloving asshole because I've overlooked an obvious hint to gift my girlfriend flowers and make her happy, or I’m a self-absorbed asshole and her purchasing flowers isn't anything to do with me.

	"body" : "I (trans man, 16) am a really picky eater. I have always had eating issues, and sometimes the texture of foods makes me uncomfortable. One of the foods that are the worst to me are green beans.My dad (49M) takes very heavy pride in his green beans. Everybody who's ever had them loves them, and he loves them too. He loves to cook, and he cooks dinner two nights of the week (we all take turns). Every time he makes green beans, he jokes with me saying stuff like \"I've got a pot of your favorite food.\" It's just normal dad jokes! We both laugh. He never actively tries to make me eat them, and he would never guilt me into doing something that I don't want to.Now, here is why I think I am the asshole. When my middle brother (18M let's call him A) and I got home, my dad said he was making green beans and made a joke. I laughed and walked down the hall when my oldest brother (M19, lets call him S) stops me in the hall and tells me that I should try the beans. He said that I can't hide from everything I don't like, and that I need to be more adventurous. I told him I have tried the green beans, I just don't like them. He got offended, saying that I need to start \"liking more things.\"A jumped onto S's case and started defending me, saying things like \"He just knows what he likes,\" and even said \"You can't talk about being adventurous, you don't leave your room.\" (For context, S graduated and rarely leaves his room. He doesn't have a job, can't drive, and isn't in college.) I told A not to talk to S like that. However, I told S that he can't be mad at me for not trying new things when he hasn't either.S got really upset with me and started being transphobic toward me. He deadnamed me, I got teary eyed, I called him an inconsiderate ass, and said I understand why he is moms favorite because nobody is going to love an ugly c*nt like him. S tried to push me down, but I pinned him against the wall as he laid his hands on me. My dad heard the noise and came running towards us, and saw the scene. I let go immediately, and S started saying I was beating him up. A told Dad it was all over green beans.My dad is disappointed with S because he hurt me over something so simple, and S is mad at all of us.Dad and A said I did nothing wrong, but I know they both baby me since I'm the youngest. I'm not mad at S because I know he didn't mean what he said. Honestly, I feel horrible for hurting him physically and mentally. I just don't know if I should address the issue or apologize. Am I the asshole?Update: S has apologized! He came into my room and we talked. I also apologized for hurting him and not handling it better. We had a conversation about how deadnaming me is super not cool, and about how what I said and did is super not cool as well. A then came to my room to ask for something and joined the conversation. Everyone has apologized to each other about it, and we all understand what we did wrong. S said that he wants to learn to drive but isn't sure where to start, and A said that he will help teach him alongside our dad. Currently, S and I are talking about entry level jobs and resumes since i'm the only kid currently working. I showed them both the post, which led to S opening up to us about his mental health. We all had a heartfelt conversation about it and how we can all support each other better. Of course we are still going to get into dumb fights (we're teenage boys and we're brothers), but hopefully nothing like this again. S wanted to say thank you to everyone who helped point out the signs to me. Tomorrow, S and I are going to talk to our dad and step-mom about what S wants to do. A would be there with us, but he is leaving for his dads house (I forgot to mention A is my step-brother, but I really just see him as my brother). Thank you for everything y'all have helped with.

She called me and screamed at me and called me an asshole and said she hates me and won't ever come back to my home. I was trying to calm her down and explain to her but she refused to listen to me",

	"title" : "AITA for turning up at a friends house at night?",
	"body" : "This is gonna be a little complicated, but Im really conflicted.Last week I went for a walk with some of my friends at night. We wanted to clear our heads and have a nice talk together. We actively didnt invite some of our other friends since we knew they wouldnt want to come or were asleep. So we kinda just roamed around the neighborhood.We had the idea to show up at one of our friends houses. Jokingly, I took a photo of their house number with the caption \"we are gonna get you\" to let them know we are here.Normally, this friend is more on the joking side, making fun of everything, but also can be quite weird sometimes. Weird in ways of them accusing me of mental abuse and ghosting me for months after I sent them a photo of me and some others partying, even though we have been like besties the previous weeks (and they could have come along too).To my surprise, they didnt take the joke well. Some time later, they thanked me for telling everyone where they live and making them panic. I responded way later, as the notification didnt pop up and  apologized. Though I told them that 1st, everyone knew already their location because we are, like, friends, and 2nd, if they really did panic, they could have called me asking if we are serious or not.I was kinda taken aback. I was expecting them telling us something like \"get lost\" in a joking manner, or waving out of the window and thats it. Not panicking about us, breaking in? Throwing stones? Staying there for the whole night? I dont know what they were expecting.They later told me I've crossed a boundary, resulting in a sleepless night. If I had known, I would never have done that. But again, they could have called me for reassurance. Though they responded with \"well I thought you were drinking\" because I didnt see the notification and a friend of us asked if we were drinking, to which another one responded with \"yep\".If we had been friends for about a year or so, I'd understand that they wouldnt notice the sarcasm or have issues trusting me. But we've been friends for 7+ years, some of them they were even in love with me. And I made it clear enough that I never drink, ever. Still, they had no trust in me nor our other friends, one of them also against drinking. We are normal people, living our life without partying often or causing scenes. They are supposed to know that by now, or so I thought.So why would they not trust us and think of the worst case scenario, without asking if we are for real?Our friendship is over because of this, and they said some really nasty things, some of them contradicting each other. They seem like a mess mentally, and had I known it was such a big deal, I would never have done that. Some of my closest friends think they are overreacting and having, again, one of their emotional bursts.Still, I'm trying to understand their point of view.

	"body" : "My friend, Chris and I have known each other since middle school. We became very close in high school. We are 25 now. He has only had one short term relationship years and years ago. And has been unsuccessful overall. Fast forward to almost 2 years now, he has a girlfriend who I can’t stand frankly.He met her off tinder, and at first all of us were so happy for him. Since he spent years chasing after me when I told him, I didn’t like him that way, but he insists that I gave him mixed messages.  For a while, I thought it was just a crush. But I guess it was more than that as he used to send me love letters and wanted to listen to my problems and help me out with everything. Maybe the lines could have been blurry idk.From the first time I met her, I’ve tried to be nothing but nice to her. But there was just this weird energy about her. I guess the first thing that threw me off is the fact that she’s not super outgoing like all of us.  Every time he brings her around, she won’t hang around the girls of the group during concerts. And only hangs by him like a lost puppy. She doesn’t ask about us, or wanna get to know us and only talks to people who talk to her first.I guess after she found out about him being obsessed with me, she has an issue with me. She doesn’t talk to me, hang out with me, and just really acts shady. Like they’ve been together all this time, we don’t know anything about her.Overtime, Chris began to get more and more distant with me. Until I asked him what the problem was. He told me that I wasn’t good for him, I broke his heart, and his girlfriend is the most important person in his life now.A few weeks later, I see them at a show, and I go up to his girlfriend when Chris is in a different part of the building. I told her that she makes everybody in the group uncomfortable, I don’t want Chris, and just pretty much everything I said here.  Trying to squash the beef. She wasn’t having it and told me she wasn’t being disrespectful she was “just existing” and walked away.He texted me the next day after she told him, and he was so mad at me for saying that.

We’ve had many bad episodes until one day there was such a bad episode bordering on abuse (throwing things near me) that I gave an ultimatum to stop drinking. Since then, he hasn’t stopped drinking completely but drinks comparatively less (not to the point of getting piss drunk where he remembers nothing the next day) and is not as much of a mean drunk.The problem is that a few times the past week he has gotten piss drunk again and while nothing bad happened, it gave me PTSD that a bad cycle may start again. He told me that he would stop drinking completely and he’s a new leaf (he is moving to join me in a new city). However for this weekend he requested if he could drink for a road trip with his friends. I said no. However this week I also got promoted and my friends were thinking of a celebration.I would like to preface this by saying I am not a drinker (I will have like two drinks in three months). I’m also a workaholic and right now really feel like blowing off steam by having a drink or two with my friends, something I usually avoid doing since I’m so cautious monitoring my partners intake.

	"body" : "I (48F) met my husband (51M) 5 years ago, and we got married 2 years ago. Pretty early on in our relationship, he told me that he had 2 daughters with his ex-wife who are now 15 and 22, and were 11 and 18 when I met them. While he was telling me about them he mentioned that after he and his ex-wife split up, his older daughter Chelsea (Not her real name) blamed him and still does. I didn’t think much of it at the time and didn’t end up meeting either of them until a year later.The first time I met Chelsea was during a 4th of July party with my husband, both his daughters, his ex-wife and her husband and various friends. By that point I had already met my younger step daughter a few times and she and I actually hit it off pretty well. However Chelsea seemed upset and kept her distance from me the whole party, and when I tried to introduce myself or even talk to her she gave me very short answers, before going into the house (it was at her mother’s house) for the rest of the night.That is essentially how our entire relationship has been. I’ve known her for 4 years and in that time I don’t think I’ve had one friendly conversation with her, nor have I seen her have a nice conversation with my husband. Every time that my husband or I try to reach out to her to try to spend time or even talk to her, she’ll blow us off or directly tell us she doesn’t want to see us, and she has never spent any individual time with us. By which I mean she’s only around in group settings like parties and family events, etc and even then she’s very cold and distant towards both of us.When my husband and I got engaged, I called both Chelsea and her sister to tell them, and all Chelsea said was congratulations and then not to expect to see her at the wedding before hanging up. She ended up not attending the wedding at all.The straw that broke the camel’s back, however, was a few days ago when she walked by while I was on facetime with my husband’s younger daughter. I called her over and asked her about her graduation (she’s graduating from college this May). She once again blew me off and told me not to worry about it, and when I told her that my husband and I would be there she said she already knew who she was giving tickets to and that it wasn’t either of us.I snapped and told her she was being ridiculous and acting like a child and that her parents’ divorce was 14 years ago and she needs to get over it. She told me that she was over the divorce but that she’ll never get over her “father being a piece of shit” (her exact words). I was honestly speechless and she hung up the facetime before I could respond.My husband got a text from his ex-wife that night, telling him that if he wants to have a relationship with his younger daughter he needs to leave Chelsea alone and tell me to as well. My husband told me Chelsea has been this way towards him since she was 9, and we're not sure what to do and it would be helpful to get some outside perspective. AITA?",

One of the people I met in the first week of school is an international East Asian girl - this will be important later - we can call Amy. We get along really well and are in the same friend group, but ever since the start of the year, Amy has made various comments that have made me extremely uncomfortable, and, quite frankly, seem racist.The first instance came on a hot, sunny day early in the school year when my friend group went to a local park. All was well as we walked there, but half-way there Amy asked the entire group if anyone had an umbrella, to which we all said no. When I asked her why, she said that she \"didn't want to get any darker\" than she already had gotten. For reference, Amy was about as pale as it gets when this happened. The rest of my friends - white or asian and all from the US - seemed shocked and uncomfortable, but I chalked it up to just being wary of sunburn because I didn't know her well yet.Just a few weeks after that, though, Amy and I were watching videos of K POP stars when she exclaimed how great their skin looks. I told her that when you have a makeup artist as professional as they do, anyone can look amazing, but, without breaking eye contact with the phone, she told me she was talking about how white their skin looked. This time I could feel a rising anger in me, so I asked her why it mattered, to which she said \"in my culture it's the beauty standard\".If you were wondering, I am black and have had to brush off all levels of racism because I am from an all white city. Part of me had hoped that by going to a university of my school's caliber and diversity, I might not have to deal with it as much, but is seems I was naive, and have heard various other comments from her regarding this same topic. I genuinely can't tell if she is oblivious to the fact she is saying white skin is the \"beauty standard\" to a black person or if she knows and doesn't care. The next time she makes a similar comment, I really want to tell her she's being offensive and that her culture's standards don't justify whatever she says. WIBTA in this situation?Edit: After some very helpful comments - thank you so much - I have definitely pivoted my stance of her comments being racist.

I was totally okay with this, but I was worried about her being in my car.I have a very bad fear of bugs. Because of that, I bug bomb my car every season (every 3 ish months), fill it with mothballs, spray every inner/outer inch with Ortho max and use a chlorine diffuser placed on the dashboard. I understand that my car is a gas chamber on wheels, but my reasoning is that it’s better to cut my life by 3-5 years compared 50 years in a deadly car accident. (I almost killed my myself multiple times endangering myself and others due to bugs in my car). Doing all this seemed to stop all bugs from appearing, I haven’t seen them for 2+ year so I do this religiously.so I let J know beforehand if she is okay with all this. Warning J all the things I did to the car and even letting her “testing” the inside of the car if she is ok with it. She said it’s all good. We also made the agreement that she won’t roll down her windows. She told me that’s fine, as the ride home is only about 15 minutes.As we were otw, J mentions that the smell is worse than she thought of, and asked if she could roll down the passenger window. I told her sorry but no, and brought up that we agreed to have the windows up. About a minute later, she just rolled the windows down. I panicked and rolled it back up. Then she started telling me that she’s getting dizzy. Now this is where I feel like a real asshole. I think I slightly gave in and rolled it down about 2mm of space. It was sunny outside, and I was afraid of potential bugs coming in.I dropped her off and J called me a weirdo psycho. I understand that this is not normal, but when choosing between a friend vs phobia, my mind automatically goes to my phobia. I absolutely despise my fear.As I am writing this down I definitely feel like an asshole. What do you guys think?Edit: I guessed it but majority votes AH. Going to apologize to J today.

Since starting middle school they have had regular sleepovers. We have been able to avoid hosting one at Ns house until now.Ns mother, T, is not my favorite person. We live in a U.S. suburb but T and I come from the same area a few states over. We graduated from neighboring HS. My hometown has some vocal bigots and T has echoed some of that sentiment over the years. We are black and R’s friends are white. We live in a well off area. I’m a scientist (PhD) for a government contractor and my husband has a MBA and owns a consulting firm.When we first met T at R’s 7th birthday she “jokingly” asked how we could afford our home and if we were drug dealers…it was awkward but I let it go. It is a lazy stereotype to imply black people with a nice house are criminals. I assumed she was just awkward or nervous. Over the years she has made “jokes” about me being “light skinned”, saying I’m an affirmative action hire, how it is easier for blacks to get into college than whites, etc. I have tried to question her logic but I confront her bs with more patience than she deserves so R doesn’t lose a friend. Part of me hopes that she grows/learns from our interactions.I grew up poor and black around poor white people. I understand that class oppression is real. I am certain T has experienced the oppression of capitalism but that doesn’t mean that I also haven’t experienced it just because I am better off now. I spent most of my childhood living in a trailer park. It was not easy being black and poor in rural America.Bs family are very wealthy and I’ve never heard T say a single thing rude in their home. Although she did initially have ann issue with B taking part in the sleepovers until As mom pointed out that they are kids and B is openly gay. As parents are working class white people. As mom has spoken up a few time when she heard T say racist nonsense. We’ve never talked about it directly but As mom and I have shared a few poignant looks over the years.All of this makes me unsure what R will experience at Ns house. I won’t be there to protect her. N is a kind child. Her and R are close and I trust my daughter to pick good people. I don’t want to punish or isolate N because her mom has problematic views. N doesn’t seem to share her views. N has talked to me about how she wants to be a scientist and asked questions about grad school and my job. My husband agrees with my concerns but doesn’t think anything will happen.

	"body" : "We have 2 small kids, 6 and 2 years old. I have a full time job and my wife has mostly been a homemaker since the 6 yo was born. For medical reasons, we have opted not to send the 2 yo to daycare, so at this point my wife is not receiving any mat leave and I am supporting the family on my salary.Despite this, I try to contribute what I can to the household. I admit I still do less than 50% of the total work around the house, but I’m genuinely interested in helping when I can. For example, and this is the topic of this post, we take turns getting the kids in the morning when they wake up too early.Also important is that my wife is what I call “nap-racist”. She gives me stink-eye whenever I try to take a nap. She was simply never a napper, always complaining that napping makes her feel groggy. Also, she’s much more anxious than I am, always putting upkeep of the house and children ahead of her own self care. My wife honestly doesn’t understand the concept of “self care,” and so is constantly nearing burnout trying to do everything for everybody but herself. Often I wonder if she sees me putting myself first (for ex: by resting) as selfish or lazy, even if it doesn’t inconvenience anyone. If my wife ever wants to nap, I’m always super supportive.Which brings us to the debate. When the 2 yo was a baby and would be up at 5am screaming hysterically and refusing to return to sleep, what to do was brutal but pretty straightforward— pick up the kid, take them far away from the other kid, and let the partner rest.Nowadays, they wake up a few times a night, usually needing a cuddle. When I go to get them, the whole procedure takes at most 2 min and they go back to trying to sleep. When my wife goes, the kid supposedly really wants her and freaks out when she leaves them, so it “takes longer”. I don’t really know why it should “take longer”, but I suspect if she tries to put them down quickly, they lose it because they know my wife will give in. Our morning family routine starts at 7:15. If the toddler is up at 6:30 and it’s my turn to get them, I go to put them back. Over half the time they lie there until 7 am. My wife thinks this is completely unfair, if the kid is up at 6:30 she just starts her day. She says that if SHE tries to put the baby back they’ll scream and she wouldn’t be able to rest anyway. But what I do on my mornings is ruining my wife’s sleep-in because the child calls for us later anyway.I genuinely don’t see her point. Wouldn’t it be better for both of us to be as rested as possible (especially if napping during the daytime is bad)? But she felt super passionate about it, even raising her voice this morning about how unfair this was (while the kid is trying to chill in their bed, mind you). I don’t know what to say. I think this is just her nap-racism sneaking in. This is why I wanted a third party’s opinion.So, AITA for trying to sneak in another 30-45 minutes of sleep when everyone’s still resting in the morning?",

That same friend is in the same friend group as them so it sucked cause I k that she was on their side, during that month the same friend started talking bad about me and ik it was them that started it.So I had this friend who liked me but I didn’t like them and I talked bad was it right no but I still did it and when I stopped talking to that friend because I didn’t like them back, they told on me to that friend group about me talking bad about them and they starting talking bad about me at school and wanted to jump me and it stressed me out to the point I faked throw up in the school bathroom just to leave and when I came back they corner me in the hallway to asked me why I was talking bad about them and I told them that I was sorry but that person who snitched on me was talking bad about them the most so I snitched and yea I feel bad and I’m not really sorry tho. So am i the a hole for talking bad about me band mate? I would like to say they still talk bad about me to this day and this is my first time on Reddit.",

I would say it was more severe than others: I would just hated authority for no reason, fight with my parents and teachers, etc. I’m asian so that’s considered pretty extreme lmaoIt’s also one of my biggest regrets, and an insecurity of mine. I was so angry all the time, and I feel like that part of me is still in there, boiling. I want it gone.In the first month or so when we became roommates, we got pretty close. We opened up to each other and confessed our insecurities and things.But whenever I brought up about my teenage years, she would go “you had a rebellious phase? I never had a rebellious phase. I was so mad at my sister when she went through hers-“ and she would start going on and on, insinuating that it was pretty fucked up for me to have a rebellious phase. It happened multiple times.I know I should’ve stopped bringing it up in front of her, but at the time, I kinda didn’t know what I was feeling. I’m not very good at keeping track of my emotions, and I often snap out of nowhere. Like this instance.I snapped one day and said “You think that (the fact that she didn’t have a rebellious phase) is something to show off about?”Apparently, I sounded angry and it scared her.She grew all quiet after that, and she stopped talking to me. To be honest, I had no idea why she stopped talking at the time.After a few hours, she suddenly apologized to me for not talking to me. So I was like “ok. Why did you stop talking?” She said something vague like “I just realized that the way we think can be different” My clueless ass was like huh?? but I didn’t push it.Then she stopped talking to me for like. 2 fucking months. I would say hi to her when I got back home and she didn’t even turn around lmao.When I finally got her to say the reason why she stopped talking - the reason was the sentence in the title - she said “I was also upset that you didn’t apologize back when I apologized to you.”Honestly, I still don’t understand why it’s such a big deal to her. I have more to say but I’ll keep it short. Was I the asshole to say that?edit: I know this doesn't make much of a difference but istg I never yelled at her  I didn't raise my voice dfjlksdfjBut I understand why I was the asshole now. I apologized to her yesterday. To be honest, now that I understand how she felt, I feel embarrassed to think I was ever in the right lmao.

	"title" : "AITA for thinking that my uncle is overstepping boundaries?",
	"body" : "I'm 15f.My great aunt married my great uncle when I was very little. I was never very close with either of them, as I was always slightly terrified of men who weren't my dad because of my mom's ex-boyfriend who made it painfully obvious he hated little 6 year old me. I only ever really saw my aunt and uncle on Thanksgiving or Easter, because they always made the family dinners. This summer, however, that changed.My great aunt's nephew, my uncle (different uncle), was diagnosed with brain cancer. My nana asked my great aunt if she would let him live on hospice in her house because her own was far too small and messy. She agreed with no hesitation and my great uncle did as well.I practically lived down there the first few weeks of summer until he passed, even then I went to their house almost everyday to make sure my nana, who was his mother, was okay. My great uncle always made sure to have biscuit's prepared for me when I got there. He even taught me to drive because my dad was always busy with work.My mother struggles financially and has no way of transportation for me. I'm an athlete who also has various appointments each month, such as therapy and the orthodontist. So it was getting increasingly difficult to ask my friends and neighbors for rides. (My dad would do it, but they're no longer together and he lives 20 minutes away from my mom and works.) My uncle started giving me rides to where I needed to go, which I appreciate greatly.He even drives a 45 minute drive to pick me up for school in the mornings and sometimes after practice as well. He gets me food everyday and I appreciate it. But sometimes he oversteps his boundaries in my opinion.I went through a breakup recently and anytime I would cry in front of my uncle he would get angry at me and yell at me and say there was \"no sense in crying over a boy.\" He later apologized for that when I obviously started giving him the silent treatment because he was upsetting me.He gets angry if I call anyone but him for a ride. I called my nana to pick me up from practice because I missed her and wanted to see her. My uncle found out and called me and was angry I didn't call him. He was half-joking, but why does it matter if I wanna spend time with my nana?He's done little things, such as threatening to take my phone if I didn't put it down, threatening to whip me (not weirdly, he just believes that whipping should still be used as a punishment), getting mad if I don't call him and tell him news that aren't his business anyways, etc.Sometimes it's just frustrating because it feels as though he's trying to overstep and be a father-figure towards me when I have an amazing father already. I love my uncle, but sometimes it just feels like he sees me as his daughter, which I'm not. It would be different if I had grown up close to him, but I didn't. As I got older, I started liking my own space and I get very angry when people try to overstep.AITA?",

	"body" : "Obligatory on mobile so sorry for any mistakes.I (27, F) met my friend, I will call her Aurora (21, F), at work. We hit it off quickly and became close friends. We ended up getting matching tattoos and introduced our friends to each other.Aurora was big on drinking and going out, whereas I’m an introvert and prefer to stay home. She went to a Halloween party last year and ended up hooking up with our mutual friend’s ex-girlfriend. I told her I didn’t like that but she said it was fine, our mutual friend didn’t care. I still told her I wasn’t interested in hearing about their sex life and ended up distancing myself a little.Fast forward maybe a month, Aurora and I were at work one day and I mentioned to her that we don’t hang out anymore. She told me to invite her places and I told her I don’t even go anywhere, she’s the outgoing one and to invite me places. That night, my other friend I will call Stanley (39, M) told me that Aurora asked him to hang out. I said to him “she can invite you to hang out but I literally told her today that we don’t hang out anymore”, he ended up leaving her on read.It’s now January, and her birthday was coming up. Stanley asked me if Aurora invited me to her birthday party, I told him no she didn’t. He said she invited him and his girlfriend, I ranted to him because she’s supposedly my best friend and he agreed that she can be very immature. Aurora and I usually donate blood together and we went on a Friday, the day before her birthday. She kept mentioning she was only donating blood because she wanted to get super drunk for her birthday and get so f**ked up on dr*gs. I asked her what she was doing and she only said getting really drunk for it.On her birthday I texted her happy birthday, she only said thankyou. Not even a pity invite. The next working day we had together, it was a Wednesday, she spoke to me like nothing happened and started going on about how much fun she had and how much great s*x she had. I just made small talk about that then only spoke to her about work. Our co-worker asked her why I wasn’t invited and Aurora said “I only invited people I wanted there, so mind your own business”. She has since been fired from work (took too many sick days off), and texted me that she was looking for another job already and she was sorry for “sucking” and that she loved me. We would always say that platonically. I left her on read.5 days later, I get this text message: “I don’t know if we’re ok, I’m sorry for fucking up. I didn’t know it would affect you in any way and I should’ve taken it more seriously. Hope you’re doing well” I again left her on read.Am I the asshole for being upset over this?

I was confused and asked her why. I couldn't understand her Norwegian and asked her to repeat what she said. So she took her phone out and used Google translate to ask me for money for the gift. I was flabbergasted as I didn't agree to get a gift let alone know about the birthday. I told her I dont have any money. (In broken Norwegian) and she immediately got upset. She kept asking me when I will get money, but I have no job and no monthly allowance like other students.I tried to use Google translate to tell her I dont have any and most likely won't for a while. But she brushed my phone away and wrote on hers \"So I paid for your gift?\" After that she put her phone away and walked off to walk to other students. I was incredibly offended and just left the class. I don't want to contribute to gifts with my financial problems and certainly not get money from my spouse (Norwegian) for something so dumb.

My dad decided to leave because my mom was always screaming and cussing and he could not handle it anymore so he left to the state he was born in. My mom after a few years got back with her ex-boyfriend from when she was in college. She never stays at our house anymore either she just goes to his house and picks us up leaving us here. I think he’s not that bad but he can be annoying sometimes. I still talk to my dad and visit him sometimes, honestly if it weren’t for school and sports I would have went with him. My mom has always been a unreasonable person by doing things like making me clean up my siblings messes over and over while they continue to mess stuff up or cursing me out because she is mad about something I have no idea about. Note that I’m a good student in the 1st honor role going to a private school. So today I was having a wrestling tournament and I ended up placing in 3rd. Normally after my tournaments I like to explain everything that happened to my mom in the car because she barely shows up to any of them even though I normally get first. I was excited to tell her about how I wrestled the number one guy in the state and almost beat him. I texted her when it was over and I waited at the tournament for almost 2 hours until she finally showed up. I got in the car and explained for a little bit, I was really excited but she told me to talk for quietly and kept interrupting me. I asked her if she cared or not because if she didn’t I would just sit there as to not waste her time. She told me she did I kept going but as I was talking about one match she put some comment in about how she thinks I was doing something to the guys arm on purpose. So I said to her “I was out their wrestling so I think I would know” and she got furious. She yelled at me and cursed me out saying that she will beat my ass, that she doesn’t care about what happened pend, that I’m disrespectful, and that she doesn’t even have to take me to wrestling tournaments. So I waited for her to finish and I put my headphones and listened to music. I could still hear her cursing at me saying that she would “take those fucking headphones and break them” note that I paid for them. I got out the car immediately when she dropped me off and I left inside to shower. After I got out I went to my laptop to work on my English essay and I saw that it our wifi wasn’t working. I reset the router but apparently she had blocked all my devices from the wifi. I texted her asking her to unblock it so I could work on my essay and I told her that this is a little crazy but she called me disrespectful again and said that I have until 12 o’clock to work on the essay. Then she unblocked my laptop.",

I thought it was respectful and mutual decision but I was wrong a few months ago I noticed she blocked me on tik tok So I sent her a long heartfelt message about my feelings towards her and how we’re at different points in life I just started a family I have a 1 year old daughter with my boyfriend and he has a 4 and 5 year old as well so I basically went from having no kids to having three and being a stay at home mom. My ex bsf has always been in a lot of drama since I met her and I unfortunately was the one who always stood up for her and fought her fights (wrong yes I now know) she’s always been in some kind of drama and it was exhausting she would FaceTime me for hours and I feel bad for saying it but all she would do was complain about her family and her problems I tried to be a good friend but after I had my baby I didn’t have much time for that I lived close to her so she would come over all the time and we would hang out basically all the time at this point in time she was still in a lot of drama 24/7 but I told her that I had a baby and I couldn’t be involved with that kind of stuff now. Fast-forward to this past summer it was her 21st birthday I had already let her know that I wasn’t sure if I was gonna be able to come or not because it was on a Monday night And I probably wouldn’t be able to find anyone to watch my daughter( I could’ve asked my boyfriend her dad but he gets up for work at 5:30 in the morning and at this time I was breast-feeding and she was a very colicky baby so it wasn’t easy) I didn’t get to go after that we didn’t really talk too much just here and there every so often and then a few months later out of nowhere I noticed she had blocked me on TikTok and I was just kinda over the friendship so I took her off of all my other social media But today, a mutual friend of ours shared with me that she had posted a video that’s private to where only her friends on TikTok, can see it basically exposing lost of my secrets, that I’ve told her 100% in confidence as well as some other lies, accusing me of using drugs, and using her when she was the one who would come over to my house because she was in so much drama that people were looking for her around her apartment, because they wanted to fight her, but backtracking a little bit Sorry she had posted that video before I sent her that long heartfelt message about how I really felt and how I think we’re just at different points in life I had unblocked her on iMessage and completely went off I said some hurtful things, but nothing compares to what she posted for everyone Who’s on her TikTok to see and she will not respond to me at all.

I never really was bothered by this and just ignored it. Something y’all should know beforehand is that we had a mutual friend but amber cut her off and I'm still very good friends with her. I also am a very blunt person if someone asks my opinion or the truth I don't sugar coat. Any way back to the problem, today we were in class and she said that Haley (the mutual friend also a fake name) was talking bad about her. I already knew this since amber was always talking about someone and it wasn't the first time she has talked about Haley either. Anyway I told her I knew what Haley has said and amber kept pushing me to tell her. Amber is very sensitive to other people's opinions btw. After 5 minutes of telling me to tell her I did. \"Well she said that she never really like that you called our friends \" your boys\" nor \" that you trained them. You are also very sensitive and people can not tell you anything and when you're upset, you act very upset where we feel obligated to ask what's wrong, no matter what's happening to us\" and she did not like that answer. She started talking crap about Haley. I bit my cheek so I wouldn't say anything to upset her. She asked me why I seemed upset and I told her bluntly \"if I tell you we won't be friends and you won't like the answer\" she said she was just voicing her opinion and I agree but she was taking it to far for me. Anyway she kept bugging me saying I had to tell her repeatedly and she said one last thing that pissed me off. \"If you don't tell you won't be my friend anymore\" this sentence enraged me bc I hate when people try to gaslight or manipulate. So I decided to tell her over text so I wouldn't yell. \"You continue to try and explain all these things yet you act overprotective over them like boyfriend's. You say best friends before girlfriends right? Yet ironically you want ray (her boyfriend) to choose you over his friends. You want me to be honest? Yet you get upset by the truth? I didn't want to admit it bc I like our friendship but I agree with each of those statements. Sometimes I feel horrible and yet you show up sad and I feel obligated to ask what's wrong. You act like a hypocrite sometimes but I ignore it bc let's be honest I do too but I won't stand for your guilt trips. I've lost a lot of people bc I didn't let them use me if you want to leave fine I enjoyed our friendship a lot but if you decide to stay and accept the truth I'll be more glad bc I truly do care about you as a friend. But I can promise you this I won't stand to get guilt tripped\" She looked at me and started to cry, and I did apologize for being blunt but she still looked at me hurt and she kept ignoring me.

	"body" : "Some backstoryMy father [48 M] left me [21F], my mom [48], and my brother [16] 3 years ago after he cheated. It wasn't pretty, because even though he stayed in the same city (though on the other end of it) we've seen each other maybe once every week or two. Our family took a big hit during that time, cause 3 days after he left, my mom's father died, and our dad didn't stay long to support us (he stayed for the funeral and two days after, but then he left, though my mother begged him on her knees to stay).The next year was extremely stressful because my mother was constantly trying to hold us together while helping my grandma and keeping us in our house. I tried to help, but I was finishing high school and was studying hard for my finals to go to college.TBF my father kept sending us money, around 1200 dollars which helped a lot. But then he got together with the woman he cheated with, and the money stopped flowing so freely. I suspect because she tries to keep him away from us and direct his attention towards her two kids (which she's been successful at)I didn't care about this much, because I've never needed much, but my mother needed this money to help us survive and let us stay in our family home. So, fearing that he would stop paying, she signed a contract with him in front of a notary that made sure that he would be paying those 1200 dollars and pay for half of our school and medical expenses.Tbf she didn't have to, because in my country child support is mandatory until 26 years old if the kid is still studying (that includes college, which I go to), but my father's money (which he has a LOT) are mostly under the table so she wanted some insurance, that he would pay that exact amount.Back to todayMy father haven't pay his share for my third year in college (I covered it) and pays around 494 dollars monthly (which is for both me and my brother), saying that he won't pay more because it will go to my mom and her new husband.But... I started living alone a few months ago, so it doesn't make any sense and my mom never used that money on herself to begin with. He also says that he feels like an ATM (which he has been saying since I was little) but I don't ask him for anything more than child support which was determined on his terms!My mom and her husband (who's kinda rich, but has two kids my age so he can't give too much to us, which my mom doesn't even want to) pay me around 543 for the flat and living expenses, but it's still not enough to live.This month he didn't pay at all! I'm meeting with him to discover why, but Reddit... Am I the asshole to expect him to pay? I don't ask him for anything, tbh I'm too afraid to do so. I know that every time I do so, he will spit it in my face sometime later, or will subtract the value of it from my child support even though he says it's a gift.

Lisa confessed that she has a crush on Kylie but Kylie is straight and has a bf. Lisa is a lesbian btw.Another girl from our group “Diana” also 16 is the most social out of us and she is a part of 2 friends groups. So we kinda merged the groups and started talking all together because a girl from Diana’s group “Allie” (15) started dating Lisa and they kissed a few times.Since I’m bffs with Lisa now she confessed that she and Allie steal from shops. I went to the mall with Lisa and Allie and they stole a pair of jeans and also 2 t shirts. I was uncomfortable with them stealing and also doing PDA and so I excused myself.Turns out most of the girls in both friends groups know that Lisa and Allie steal and some have stolen as well. Like they have a second gc where they would share what they stole and discuss stealing tactics and plans to which shop to go. I disapprove of this behaviour because they may get in trouble for that and get me in trouble too. I confronted Lisa and she told me to not tell Kylie about it as Kylie’s parents are police officers.

She had to work two jobs and worked her way out from a small apartment into a townhouse and now a home.When we first got the house we all split rent between my mom and siblings, however during Covid my father got sick and needed a place to stay as he is mentally impaired and partially physically impaired. He can’t work due to all the illnesses he’s had in his life on top of a stoke, and broken hip. My mother holds a ton of resentment against my dad and initially made him move in so he could help with rent and connect with his kids he relatively had almost no relationship with.Over time things became very toxic since my father joined us in this home, which caused my younger brother to move out (he owns his own company so this made it easier for him financially. Now that my younger brother moved out it put more financial stress on my mom and now she has decided she will rent out a room in the house to an ex convict.This is a son of a close family friend but he’s spent his life in and out of jail non stop. We do not know him very well other than helping him out while he was inside to get money and other than seeing him on holidays a few times.It is very expensive for me to move out at this time because of the economy and even if I wanted to do so I can’t afford it on my own. My mother had a tendency of always wanting to help others at our expense. Right now she’s thinking of survival but now I have to deal with my toxic father and an ex convict in the house.

We noticed a guy walking with his dog (off leash) on the opposite side of the park that overlooks the beach. There is construction going on at the beach and a makeshift barrier the workers put up. It cuts the park in half to allow tractors/trucks to go down to the sand to work. The guy and his dog were on the opposite side of this divide. We figured we would stay and let our dog sniff the grassy area that was not blocked off by construction. After a few minutes our dog decides to do his business and before we can even pick it up, this guys dog comes running up to us.. off leash.. We tell him that or dog is not friendly and to please keep his dog away from us and to put his on a leash (or dog isn’t necessarily “unfriendly” however we really didn’t want to interact with this guy to begin with). He tells us “I can do whatever I want” that we are “acting crazy and shouldn’t be bringing your dog to a park if it isn’t friendly” after we called him out. We told him it’s literally illegal to have your dog off leash in a public space and that it’s pretty common knowledge. He walks off yelling at us that others do it all the time. We were left completely shocked at the situation that just unfolded. Are we the assholes for killing this guy out when his dog approached us?",

	"body" : "Disclaimer before you read: I love my best friend (Ashley) and i would do a lot for her and to see her happy. We have been friends for about 4 years now and close throughout with no major arguments just a handful (like 5 if that) of annoyances if that makes sense. I can just describe it as a married couple bickering lol. Also i have the brain of an overthinker, so i'm not trying to find things wrong but its just where my brain has gone to.Additional context: i originally had mentioned that i wasn't sure if i could make it because it is very expensive but i moved some money around and ended up not needing to pay a bill i thought i had. So i updated her saying yay i can make it. But now that i have thought about the plans i'm not sure i WANT to go even if i can make it.My best friends birthday is in about 3 weeks and her celebrations are on the weekend of it. She has planned for her friendship group and me to take a trip up to a major city and stay in her parents condo and go out drinking/clubbing. (for context we are all about 19-22 so its the norm for people our age where we are). One of the main issues i am having with this is that there are 3 couples going + me.   So, Ashley and her bf and 2 other couples. I will essentially be 7th wheeling. Now i could maybe possibly get past this if i knew all 6 of them well, but i don't. Don't get me wrong they all seem like lovely people and i get along with them but were not close, so this point alone seems like a very uncomfortable situation for me.The second thing i'm not too keen on is the drinking and clubbing. I have recently decided to give up alcohol pretty much as a whole with exceptions here or there. For instance nye i went with my boyfriend to a firework show and then a fancy hotel and we drank together. We didn't get hammered, we got a nice amount of drunk and i was in a situation i felt comfortable. I do want to stress that i didn't give up alcohol because of addiction reasons i just am not that fond of it, i hate how vulnerable it makes me and hangovers just all in all it doesn't seem worth it to me to drink. I mentioned this to her and she mentioned that her intentions were to get \"white girl wasted\" which we have gone out clubbing together before and gotten super drunk like embarrassingly so, which i loved and i love doing things like that with her, occasionally. Also not in February when its fucking freezing outside and the girls are all talking about wearing mini dresses and heels. Again, i love dressing like that so also not judging just i don't really want to  in -5c weather.Thirdly, this is an expensive trip for one night going out. I am unemployed right now and am on a very tight budget and to be very frank i wouldn't want to waste the money that i barely have right now on something i don't think i will enjoy.so reddit, WIBTA if i cancel on my besties birthday celebrations?",

My friend (33M) has been pestering me to share the name of the immigration agent I used in India.I would normally be ok with this, but the agent specifically is very selective and told me not to tell his name to anyone.This is because what this agent offers is a lot superior to others. He arranges everything, including living accomodation and finding a job and unlike many others offers a path to PR and citizenship. However it requires trust on both sides as once you obtain a PR you could work for a different job than the one he provides if you wanted but the agent requires that I work at least a certain number of years.I have seen other immigrants struggle and have to live in crowded flats and I am very grateful for this agent as I live in a great 1 bedroom flat by myself  and while I have a low wage in Canada for my job, the agent has someone gift me the difference in India so I make the equivalent of 100K CAD after tax.Unfortunatelty I already told him I used an agent when I had left and despite me telling him that the agent said not to disclose who he is, my friend is persisting.

Cheers)I (M38) and my wife (F37) got into a (little) argument last week. She is going soon for a 3 weeks trip to the US (We are European) for some research studies in a prestigious school (unpaid and outside her work scope). I pushed her to take this opportunity and instead, will take care of the 2 boys back home (and just for the record, as I start seeing that people believe men don't take care of kids... where we live, I took more paternity leave and do most of the activities with them as I enjoy. So this not me being scared being with my boys :D).After these 3 weeks, I expected my wife to fly back directly to us. However, she asked me if she could fly to New York and visit the city for 3 days. She said it is her childhood dream and does not know if the opportunity will present itself again. I have told her that this is also a dream of mine and I would have liked to experience it with her, but now I will not.While she was talking about it, I felt really disappointed and sad that she would not like to come back asap to her family. I told her I disagree and I do not want her to fly to New York but instead fly back to us. She refused and said that she will book the tickets anyway.We are used to travel often for work (2-3 days) and we always take one extra day to visit. However, I just felt that this time 3 weeks is not 2-3 days.In some way, I feel angry at myself for thinking that my wife is selfish, but at the same time I believe I should not interfere with her dream. However,  I cannot stop thinking that I would not have behaved this way, especially after 3 weeks.I have now asked her to unbook her tickets, or else I will also book a 3 week trip abroad by myself when she is coming back.

We’ve had 6 consecutive attempts of seeing each other fall through for various reasons, so we haven’t seen each other in almost 2 months.

I asked him if he could just work Saturday instead of both days-that way, he could still make some extra money and see me as well. We got into a bit of an argument-he said several times he “won’t miss an opportunity to make an extra $500” but I was trying to tell him, he’d only miss out on $250 if he chose to work just Saturday.

I am fine with not having friends since most people are weird anyways. But I dislike having to go to school as classes are boring and I learn much faster reading by myself and I have to talk to the aforementioned weird people.I enjoy reading about various topics and had a rather fantastical idea, so I ran away from home to have an adventure. I spent 3 days travelling by train to various places.When I got caught and returned home, my mother was questioned for not having been aware that I had gone missing for 3 days.

So the day come, and I was up early waiting on ticket master website, and to my surprise, I got in, so I thought, I might as well just buy 2, and go with her, so I ended up buying 2 seat at the far end of the stadium, at the price of 180 each. And then I think, it was only 180 each, and her birthday is coming up in a few month, might as well just gift it to her as a birthday gift, so I told her such, she was very excited, and gave me the best BJ I ever had when she came back to Canada.Well, the issue comes when I started dating my current gf (lets call her PonPon) (who is also a fan of Taylor Swift), when I started seeing her, I decided that it would be weird to still go to Taylor's concert with my EX, so I just asked my EX if she know someone who want to go with her, and she said one of her friend really wanted to go but was not able to get a ticket, so I just told her she can have my ticket. I did not tell her about the ticket since I already gave it away and not have it anymore. Everything was fine until we meet up with our friend for New Year, and one of my friends just casually asked that \"now I am dating PonPon, what do I do with the Taylor Swift ticket?\" PonPon instantly asked me \"you have Taylor Swift ticket?\" I just said \"oh yeah, but it was for my ex and I, and when I started dating you, I just gave mine to her friend, because you know, it would be weird to still go when I am in a relationship with you.\" well, she did not take it well, and ask \"you could just aske her to give her ticket back, and we can go together\", I just said \" I am not taking back a birthday gift\". at this point, she was visibly annoyed and just said \"Then ask her to give your ticket back\", So I asked her \"do you want to sit next to my Ex?\" at this point she just blew up at me, saying I care more about my Ex, that she is my current gf so she should have the ticket, so I just told her \"I didn't even know you back when I gifted her ticket, so I am not asking for the ticket back, and that is final.\" Well, now she is telling me the relationship is not gonna work if I prioritize my ex over her, and want to break up, but I don't think I am prioritizing my ex over her since the whole thing was before I even met my gf, so AITA?",

He has mobility issues and is now older so he kinda retired from his criminal lifestyle. Of course Megan like a proper daddy’s daughter moved in with him to a different state and now caters to each and every his need while painting herself as a saint who takes care of her disabled dad.Meanwhile I stayed with mom, she got married again and is doing pretty well. I have a job and even though I didn’t go to college I’m still pretty successful. I don’t really talk with Megan and our dad, I just follow her on social media and that’s about it.Now to the conflict: our mom had a birthday and of course Megan got invited as well even though she doesn’t really talk to mom.

I got annoyed and said “well, of course it’s better than the mafia front place you’re used to”.She looked at me and said “what mafia front” and I said “well it’s you who lives with a mafia boss”. Mom looked at me and it was obvious that she was absolutely mortified. Her husband was pretty shocked too. Megan said something like “ah, this” and went back to bragging about her job, she’s a lawyer btw.Later after she left, mom approached me and said that I went overboard with the joke and that it wasn’t even funny. She also said that I shouldn’t have insulted my sister, especially since she is the one to take care of her disabled parent. Now I feel like I was TA to her.",

	"title" : "WIBTA for reporting my friend for providing alcohol to minors?",
	"body" : "I (18F) have a group of \"friends\" from college, I say \"friends\" because not everybody's close. One of my friend's (soon to be 28F) birthdays is approaching and she's invited us (16F, 17F, 18F, 22F, 25F) out for a meal and drinks.Here's where I have a problem:The plan is that we go out to a restaurant for drinks and maybe grab something to eat on the way. This would take place in the city since we all live pretty far. The older girls (27 & 25) want the underage ones to be able to drink. The plan would be either the legal girls order drinks for them or they sneak vodka into the restaurant. The legal age for drinking where am from is 18.I feel uncomfortable about this. There's no point in pretending that people underage don't drink however the two girls who are underage have never drank. The 17 year-old is my best friend and she's been wanting to drink for a while now however her birthdays quite a while away. The 16 year-old is autistic and has problems with anxiety. The plan isn't to just \"drink\" I don't have a problem with that, they want to get drunk (not my words, the words of the the girls aged 16,17,25,28). Then afterwords we would all take the train back alone to our places since we live far. I personally don't plan on drinking much, I don't want to get drunk and probably won't stay out long but both the underage girls want to. I can't help but feel like it's unsafe, the 16 year-old has never taken a train herself and is vulnerable due to her being autistic. I don't believe her mother is aware of what's happening. My best friend has anxiety and I honestly don't know if she's ever taken the train alone before (not something we've really discussed I've only known her since last year). The city we are going to isn't the nicest, I'm originally from the city and even I don't think it's safe, the crime rate is up dramatically lately and even people from the city are avoiding going out as much as possible. I didn't think my friend (27) would do something like this, I honestly think a lot less of her because of it. It's well known in the group that the 16 year-old is very naive and vulnerable and that my best friend has anxiety so them taking the train home drunk just seems like a recipe for disaster. The only thing I can think of doing is to maybe report it to the college or their  parents but I just know my relationship with my friends would be over but I want them to be safe.So WIBTA and am I just being dramatic?Also just for reference the train is 50 minutes for me, 45 for the 16 year-old and 1 hour for my best friend. We don't live close, I'm 50 minutes away from my best friend by bus and there's no train.",

I said what if he gets hit by a car, and my dad said someone else will find it first.I'm so frustrated that he didn't stop, even if just for a few minutes to keep an eye on the dog and see if an owner came into view (maybe they were just out of sight I don't know) and we could either let them know. I didn't expect him to get out the car, or put the dog in his car, or take it home with us. I literally just wanted to stop a few minutes to keep an eye on the dog and a lookout for the owner and if no one appeared I could call an animal service/stray service and maybe take a picture to post in the local towns Facebook group. Just done something!I'm so angry that he just didn't care about someone else's pet and the danger it was in and stopping for even a few minutes. He was just so blasé about it. Am I right for being so angry about it and calling him out for not even stopping or is it not my place to be angry, as obviously he can do what he wants so I don't know if I should've expected him to stop?

Every year at my highschool they do this big mexican celebration (im in mexico) to clebrate our tradition and shiz, and everyone is mandated to participate in it. They give each grade a little post to sell food and drinks, and they give us a bunch of tickets so we can sell them and fund the party.My (20f) sister went to the same school i am in and put herself as my tutor, wich means shes basically the one the school sends the emails and calls about tuition and stuff like that, so since shes alredy been to about 3 of this partys she knows the gist of it and was supposed to help me sell the tickets, aswell as my (50m) father who  is the one who pays for the tuition. When i told him said \"yeah ill help you sell em\". A month passes and its a week before the party, and i had still not sold any tickets, and i forgot about them cause of exams and they where just collecting dust in my drawer.Thats when my father tells me \"hey you wanna go to seaworld with me n your stepmom?\" Wich to i say \"sure\", but i was on the day of the party, wich i didnt really mind not going to cause its seaworld. After i return, the party is over and i never hear from the tickets again. A week after that, i get told by the principal i need to pay some late fees on tuition n extra stuff (wich i presume where the tickets), i tell my dad and he pays with some troubles from the sales department at the highschool, but it gets resolved.Mind this is in late september, jump to a week ago at the end of the winter break when my sister comes to me saying \"hey, i just got a call from school saying you need to pay for the tickets you had to sell, how many did you sell?\" And i told her \"none, i didnt go to the party, plus, you n dad didnt really help me sell shit\" to wich she gets mad at me for \"not being responsible\" and i tell her \"tf was i supposed to do???\" To wich she responded \"you couldve sold them to your friends\" wich i did try, none of them wanted to get in extra dept. she tells me that we have to pay for the tickets, and i ask her how much is it, SHE SAYS 30 BUCKS PER TICKET. I found the old strip of tickets amd counted 16, wich means at a total it would cost us about 400-500 dollars.now my sister and mom are mad at me for this, and i dont even know if my father knows yet, and i cant sell them now that the party was done 4 months ago, i honestly dont think im the ah in this situation, cause this is the first of this partys i was in and my sister was supposed to help me out, she did nothing, and my father was supposed to help me sell the dang tickets, he also did nothing, i did my part to the best of my knoledge and they did not help at all, now my family is mad at me....so reddit. AITA?Update: i tough i might need to clear up somethings about my situation, so heres a quick notes:i really dont want to just place the blame somewhere else, i believe in consequences for actions, i also see how i have may come across as irresponsible, wich i kinda are, i have no real expirience with this stuffI really couldnt just \"take responsibility\" of selling the tickets, people at school didnt want more tickets, i dont know anyone outside school, and i couldnt sell them around cause i aint allowed to wander around in the streets, also i couldnt sell them online, thats why i needed the help from my family.When i say \"oh i forgot\" i mean that i was in the middle of exam season and had to study for ablut 12 differen exams and projects wich took all my attention at the momentUpdate 2: aight i think to clear up MORE things4. some people seem to think i just got the tickets and didnt even mention them to my parents, and now blame them, and sorry if i told it like that, english aint my first language and its my first time writing a aita story. I did tell my family about my tickets, for about 2 weeks straight, we got the tickets at the start of the semester, i talk to my family about it, then at the end lf the semester i entered exams and thats when i left the tickets in a drawer. i asked them about 7 times in 2-3 weeks before the exams came5. The tickets arent a house to house sale, they literally just give you a bunch of tickets n say \"sell em\"Update 3 and final: well i read alot of your comments and responded to a few, and the situation just got resolvedYES im a ass for not remembering my responsibility YES the school is a ass for giving students over 400 dollars worth of stuff YES my fam couldve help me more At the end of the day im mostly at fault, and i accept itI just talked to my father about the matter and he told me to not worry too much about it, he will pay the fee, and even apologized for not helping me sell the tickets, i also apologized for getting him into this mess, as for my sister i think shes still mad at me, but i think itll blow offThanks for the kinda reality check and for the supportAlso if any tiktokers see this: DO NOT POST THIS STORY, I DONT MEAN THIS AS CLOUT CHASING AT ALL, I TRULY FEAR THIS GETTING BACK TO MY KNOWN ONES OR EVEN THE SCHOOLThanks for reading ",

Terry and I have been very close since we were young, due in part to our families living in the same neighborhood. He recently decided to move in with his boyfriend, Kyle, who has two cats of his own. Terry came to visit me and explained that Nala didn't get along with Kyle's cats and he wasn't sure what he was going to do about it; he said he might give Nala to his mother (my aunt). He asked if I would be willing to take Nala in for a month or so until he figured it out. He said he would provide food, litter, etc for her and that when he came to pick her up (once he figured out what he wanted to do) he would pay me $200.Before agreeing, I asked him if Nala had been spayed. One of my cats, Binx, hasn't been fixed yet because I got him semi-recently and, as they're all male and strictly indoor cats, it hadn't been my top priority. He reassured me that Nala had been spayed and I agreed to take her in for the month.The issues started in the second week. I messaged Terry to let him know that Nala's food and litter were running low, and he said he would send me the money to replace it. After two days (and constant asking) he still hadn't sent it, so I bought her food and litter with my own money. At the end of the month I asked Terry when he would be coming to pick her up. He never gave me an answer.Around the six week mark, Nala was sitting in my lap and I noticed she'd gotten fat. I was sure she was pregnant and messaged Terry to ask him again if Nala had been spayed. He admitted that she was not, and explained that he was worried I wouldn't take her in if he told me the truth. I told him that I still would have taken her in, but if I had known, I could have kept her away from Binx. Terry said that it was my cat who got Nala pregnant and I could deal with it.I got angry then and told him he would be taking Nala back, with the kittens, the next time he came to visit his parents. Well, he never did. Nala had the kittens two weeks ago and they are still in my care. I now have nine cats to take care of and I work full time. Seeing as Terry told me the cats were my problem because it was Binx who knocked Nala up, I decided to sell them to a few friends of mine who I know to be responsible cat owners. I posted some pictures of one of my friends visiting her kitten (they are still too little to separate from Nala yet), and Terry messaged me saying I needed to give him half of whatever I made from selling the kittens. I told him that because he never gave me the money for Nala's food and care, I would be keeping the money from selling them and we could call it even. I told him he is welcome to pick up Nala and the kittens and sell them on his own, but he said he couldn't. Now my aunt is angry at me and saying it's only fair to give Terry half of the money.",

We slightly rushed our wedding as my dad has several health issues and recently had a heart attack. I wanted to make sure he would be around to walk me down the aisle. Because of this, we didn't have much money for a wedding. It was less than $1500 counting my wedding dress and looked better than I could have imagined. We served homemade tacos for food and had water, juice, and soda to drink. We had our wedding in an art gallery so even hiring a bar and having people pay for the alcohol themselves was not an option as it was a small town gallery and had no built in bar. Most of the people in our families is Mormon so don't drink anyway. Therefore I didn't think no alcohol would be a problem. A few people brought their own and a friend even brought my husband and I some champagne to have which was appreciated. We didn't hear any complaints and assumed everything was fine. However, recently I have found out a ot of people were upset we didn't supply alcohol. A lot of people assumed I was pregnant and that was why.

Toys are scattered everywhere downstairs (living room, kitchen, entryway), food is caked onto the kitchen floor and the high chair from the infant, and dishes are left out with food hardening on them.In addition, things just start to pile up around the house over time from never being put away. Clothes are tossed on or at the base of the stairs until they are a huge pile, things that have been taken out are just left on the tables or countertops until those are piled up as well. Some of this stuff is kid items but some are also my spouse's items that are used and never put away. Our bedroom has food and trash everywhere and every night our bed has crumbs all over because our kids wake up (8-9 AM) and my spouse sends them downstairs to get food to eat in bed with them so my spouse can sleep more.Every few months we have people over for some reason or another and there is always a fight leading up to it because of the mess. It takes us multiple days of cleaning for hours a day to get the house in a state where we can have guests over. I get extremely frustrated because the bulk of our cleaning comes from cleaning up the accrued daily mess that happens while I am working.  We clean up for multiple days to have people over and within a week the house is back to where it looks like we never cleaned at all.I understand that being a stay at home spouse and caring for kids is a job in it's own right but I feel like part of that includes picking up after the kids so we aren't left with this giant mess constantly. If things were picked up throughout the day then we wouldn't have such a large list of things to do once the kids are in bed. I also feel that if you take something out to use, you put it away when you are done instead of leaving it on the counter.I'm not expecting my spouse to do things like clean the bathrooms or do all the dishes daily, just pick up after themselves and the kids during the day as they go.

When we moved in together I started noticing that he would often come right to bed without brushing his teeth. When I would bring it up he would say he’s too tired and would brush them in the morning. Over time, I realized he often wasn’t brushing them in the morning, either. He didn’t NEVER brush his teeth, he insists he brushes once a day, but in reality it’s like once every other day or so. This is a really foreign concept to me, as I don’t feel comfortable going to sleep without brushing my teeth and feel gross if I leave the house in the morning without brushing them.I blocked his way from going to work without brushing them just now and he joked that he’s “living in a prison”. We’d been talking about dealbreakers (theoretically) a couple days before and so I said that “basic hygiene is a dealbreaker for me” and he asked lightheartedly if my love for him was that fickle.  I said yes, and he brushed his teeth before leaving.It’s a topic we talk about constantly but haven’t made much progress. When I take a more serious tone with it he seems to be a bit defensive/annoyed so I haven’t pressed it too much. I honestly think it’s really gross that he’s not consistently brushing his teeth, and I’m worried about his long term dental health. WIBTA if I put the joking aside and seriously insist he must brush them twice a day, every day?Edit: He hasn’t been to a dentist since we started dating for insurance reasons, his breath does smell really bad in the morning but he’s over a head taller than me so it’s not in my face unless we’re being intimate or lying in bed.

Nothing new for online gaming, people insult each other all the time.Joined the squad, they talked and telling jokes, I told a few back and they laughed. Back and forth on the jokes, insulting this guys mother and how long the line was at her house stuff like that. More jokes told from both sides. They said that I was a lonely fat loser who got no pussy, I said I have a gf and that’s when the main guy/insulter said that she was a fat whore with saggy tits. I said no that’s your mother and more laughs from the rest of the squad. He doubled down again and I said she’s 180 and not even close to 300 pounds.Girlfriend comes over and I hand the headset to her and she says hello since the other squad mates wanted to say hi. Now I can’t say what was said during this time as the sound was only coming from the headset, but from what my girlfriend said the main insulter guy was calling her a fat whore with saggy tits that touch her belly. She was understandable upset and quickly handed the headset back, the other squad mates said it was a dick move and he should calm down and I agreed. I stopped talking and just sat in silence and played not engaging with anyone, I didn’t want to leave the squad as the rest of the guys were decent but I ended up leaving after a bit anyways. Main insulter said he felt bad because he “broke up the relationship” and was berated by the rest of the squad mates for being too harsh.Later gf and I had a fight about it saying that she felt disrespected by the guy, that I should of stood up for and defended her and I shouldn’t be playing with them. I said I don’t know them, never played with them before and probably never will again. I didn’t defend her which I know was wrong, but as most of us have delt with these types of screaming/baiters before it’s best not to engage with them because nothing you do will make them stop other than leaving or just not engaging. She said that she feels disgusted because what if that happens in person and how does she know that I’ll defend her. I said that it was different in person and related it to typing a comment online where a person could say whatever you wanted and you gotta ignore the ragers/baiters online.TLDR- Random screamer/baiter in a video game insulted my gf.

I've never enjoyed skieng, which would be fine if I had any friends there or enjoyed the other activities we'd do. I'm curently being tested for autism, so you can guess that I don't enjoy partying or joining my parents with their friends. I also find it hard to make friends, so I am friends with none of the children of my parent's friends. Basically, my parents are asking me to join them on a vaccation that would mean total isolation from my peers.I've joined them on skieng trips before, and they're using that as evidence that I do enjoy it. That is simply not true. I didn't have a choice in wether or not I got to come with, and there was nothing I could do exept for skieng. Sitting in a shitty hotel room the entire day seems even less fun than being out on the snow.I also function as a free nanny the entire time we're on the trip.

We got a new fridge about 2 months ago that you can get ice or water out of the front. The problem arose when our cousin (35M) who's been staying with us for the past 2 years started giving the dogs water out of the water dispenser. He's the one who gives them food and water at night and in the morning (out of choice).  He gives them that water because \"if we're drinking the water they deserve to as well\" but the water will splash and get all over as it goes into their bowls.  One of our dogs has rotting teeth (she should be getting them taken out soon) and it makes her breath HORRIBLE and our other dog licks his own pee so their slobber getting on the water dispenser makes me feel sick. A few hours ago I brought it up to my mom asking if we can switch them back to using the sink water and she said no. For some quick context, she doesn't use the water or ice dispenser. She drinks bottled water and I'm the main person who drinks the water out of the fridge. I asked her why she said no and when she didn't give an answer I got upset and we got into an argument. She says i‘m being overdramatic and that it's not that big of a deal if the water splashes out of the bowl but I say it is a big deal because I drink out of that and I don't want to drink their slobber. I also brought up that it would  be faster to fill up their bowls using the sink and now she's completely ignoring me and it's making me feel like maybe i'm the asshole. So... AITA??",

	"title" : "AITA for going off on my friend after she made a joke too many times to the point it wasn’t funny anymore?",
	"body" : "I (F18) am in a typical friend group of 6(also all F18), and we’ve been best friends for the past 2 years. Obviously we’re all in our last year of school so we don’t want any unnecessary drama or stress so we barely ever argue. Anyway for context I have dyed red hair, and to maintain the colour I have to use red shampoo, red conditioner, a red hair mask and to wash it under cold water. It’s tedious and my hairstylist also told me not to wash my hair too many times to maintain the colour. My hair is also extremely damaged so washing it too much would probably make me bald and that’s unfortunately not the look I’m going for, so I only wash it twice a week, and so I have an everything shower every time I wash my hair, kind of to kill two birds with one stone. Some of my friends find it disgusting, and keep telling me to wash it even though I’ve explained over and over again that it’s super hard to do that and I don’t want to end up balding or with fading hair, and they keep making jokes about how they can fry eggs in my hair and all that. I normally just laugh it off but it’s gotten so repetitive that laughing it off becomes an acquired skill that I have not mastered. They’re making me seem like this greasy slimeball monster but it’s not even like I’m unhygienic, I brush my teeth every morning and every night, shower at least once every day and never ever skip my morning and evening skincare routine, and the worst thing is that they’re always making these jokes in public at the top of their voices. So anyway the last two weeks were mocks week, and naturally my tedious everything shower routine wasn’t really a priority, and I had to show up to school bare-faced w greasy hair every day which was actually painful for me. All I did today was tell my friends that I was excited to be wearing makeup and pretty clothes to school for the first time in two weeks and finally looking like the cute hyper feminine girly girl I am and they’ve just hit me with a barrage of insults about how I’m so scary and how I can’t be feminine with my unwashed hair because apparently you have to wash your hair every single day. I literally know what to do when there’s grease in my hair, I always style it into a slick bun or any other cute hairstyle that I’ve always thought I look good in but the fact that I don’t wash my hair every day suddenly makes me look like a bloodied goat to the slaughter shitting fear diarrhoea everywhere with matted fur and a single dangly earring. They said I was and I quote, “disgusting” and “scary”, so I just explained that my hair stylist told me not to wash my hair more than twice a week, and they said that “[I] don’t need a licensed doctor or stylist to tell me to wash my hair every day”, so I just went off on them and told them that jokes are funny, but I’d appreciate it if they were at least doing it in a way that made me think they were minding their own business and not making me feel so ugly and so dirty and unfeminine. Am I the asshole for responding the way I did? ALSO, if it’s any solace to anyone, I’m typing this with WASHED hair!! and I’m planning on washing it again before school on Monday! edit: OKAY just wanted to clarify, my hair is nowhere near the point where it’s so damaged i need to cut or shave it, it’s not thin, it’s really thick, it’s not frizzy and it has improved since i started washing it this way! its not very healthy but it is smooth, once again thick and it is moisturised! it’s mostly to maintain the colour but tysm for the concern. it’s not fried at all, it was when i got a chemical perm done years ago in korea, and that took a lot of repairing, even chopped half my hair off that time to recover. it’s longer and healthier now! i’m only listening to my stylist but again tysm for all your concerns once again my hair is NORMAL, it’s not dead at all, but it could be if i don’t take care of it properly, im also just lazy i was just really really really mad when i was typing this so i was exaggerating the condition of my hair by a lot in the heat of the moment! my hair is as damaged as colour treated hair inevitably gets! i get regular hair treatments after colour every salon visit (tokio inkarami n olaplex) <3333",

If you don’t know what that is- you’re given a target and a water gun (the super tiny handheld ones) and you have to “kill” (spray) your target in a certain amount of time to move on to the next round. You are also someone else’s target so you have to be aware of your surrounding and not get eliminated. Not to mention right now the cash prize for winning the game is in the thousands since it was a $20 but in and about 250 people are playing.My boyfriend has been wanting to go see this one movie with me that came out in theaters a few weeks ago and i told him after the first round of assassins started that I couldn’t because if I leave to go to the theaters I might get out. I told him after I got out we could go.After the first round ended, I hadn’t gotten my target out and was eliminated. The next day (today) there was a buy in to re enter the game. It was pretty cheap so I did it. My bf then asked if I could go see the movie with him but I told him I had re entered the game.He then called me selfish for choosing the game over him when I suggested we could just go to a theater outside of our town (it’s maybe 20-30 mins away) or we could figure out a way to watch it at one of our houses through somethings like soap2day or something (not ideal but it’s an idea). I really dont think I’m chosing the game over him considering in the two weeks this game has been going on this is the first time we won’t be able to do smth because of the game.So AITA for wanting to play the game and refusing to go see a movie with him and am I being selfish?",

Like all teachers she gives me rows and has an answer to everything, which is fine. This year I’ve started my AS qualifications and she teaches me for 2 out of 4 of my subjects which is great as previously stated we get on amazing.Most of my friends are in the younger years, year 10-11 which isn’t so bad as there’s a year, 2 most between us. I absolutely love my friends as they’ve been there for me through everything even though they are a bit younger than me.I bumped into my teacher in the corridor while she was on duty and we got to talking. We started talking about the people I hang out with, which I told her that I like my friends in the younger years as they get me more than my “friends” in my year do. The people in my year group I absolutely hate, they’re all fake with nothing better to do than talk about another and then be fake friends with them as soon as they walk into the room. I explained all this to her and she told me: “You’re in year 12 now, you shouldn’t be hanging around those people, while they’re trying to get out of lesson you are in yours. They will pull you down with them and you will fail. You need to cut them out of your life before they ruin it.” She said some other things that I don’t really remember much but they were along the same lines. This really ticked me off as those girls are my life so I just started screaming at her, I have never in my life yelled at her before so this came as a shock to anyone that was in the same corridor as us. I just carried on yelling like it was nothing.As I was yelling, my head of year and assistant head walked by and just stood and stared at me while I was still yelling. She had made me really mad and upset and that had set me off. As soon as I stopped yelling I realised who was there and how many people were staring and I immediately felt bad. I apologised immediately and ran off hoping it wouldn’t come up again.I had her later that day and she kept me behind to talk about what had happened and I explained that I was sorry but she was out of line.Looking back at it now she was just looking out for me and she didn’t deserve to be spoken to like that in front of her students and peers. I still stand by my points and do not regret yelling at her, we are still as close as we’ve ever been. But people are telling me that I was the asshole for reacting like that.So AITA for yelling at my teacher?EDIT: Just to add, I apologised immensely and done so for a few days after. We had a sit down and a talk about what happened and why I had lashed out. We talked it through and we’re completely fine. She said she understood why I lashed out but if I feel that way about something she says again to go see her privately, which I have done. I understand what I done was out of line but I made amends. She is my favourite teacher and I would never do anything to ruin our relationship on purpose. Anyone who bottles things up and takes it out on the wrong people should understand. I am also neurodivergent which I now understand may have had a role in my outburst.I am so thankful to have a teacher that understands me and instead of yelling back, just talks to me.Yes I am still friends with the girls in the younger years and no I will not be dropping them.",

This caused me and Lily to also get into an argument. Lily claimed that it was my fault and that I hurt her feelings. I then started to ignore her. I don't think I am the asshole since I had my reasons to ignore her and to be on Sally's side.Sally has been in a situation ship with a boy named Bob. During this, she gained feelings for him. But later, he decided to end things. He lied to her about why he wanted to end it. This hurt Sally a lot since she knew he was lying. Thankfully, they fixed things and decided to stay as friends. After that, more things happened, which caused their friendship to get more awkward.One of our friends, Lily, decided to take things into her own hands. She asked Sally if she could send Bob a few messages. Sally said no, but Lily kept on insisting. I also told her not to do it. She did it anyway. The messages she sent him were like, \"You're a bitch\" and \"Stay away from Sally,\" This made Bob think that Sally was talking behind his back, so he cut off all contact with her. This made Sally even more upset. She got mad at Lily and blamed it all on her. After that, I told Lily to apologize to Sally, and she said she will.Then 2 weeks later, when Sally and I were ranting to each other, she told me about how Lily didn't apologize. So, I went to talk to Lily the next day. I asked her if she apologized and she said she did. Then she talked about how it was all Sally's fault. When we were talking about it, the bell rang, so we had to go home. I decided to text Riley asking about it, and then she told me that Lily did apologize, but it wasn't genuine. I then asked Sally, and she said the same thing that Riley did.I texted Lily asking if her apology was genuine, and she said it was. I knew she was lying because of what Riley and Sally said. I told her that Sally felt like the apology wasn't genuine, so she should try again. Lily got mad at me, and she asked why she should apologize first.I decided to text Sally instead, asking if she could talk to Lily. She said the same thing that Lily did. I started to get upset since they won't listen to my advice.As I continued to text them, I got annoyed to the point where I snapped. I started cursing at them. I then calmed down. Then I texted both of them and I apologized for snapping at them. Sally forgave me, and she also apologized for bringing me into this mess. But Lily didn't care about my apology. She got even more mad at me. I asked Riley for advice, and she told me to leave her alone, so I did. Later Lily texted me something about school. I was still upset, so I didn't respond. Then, she went to shit-talk me in a different gc. She then texted me saying how I hurt her. I didn't respond since I knew she was trying to guilt trip me into thinking it was my fault.

	"body" : "I started dating my boyfriend last year in June. He was my coworker back 4 years ago.We started getting close in May, when he started to talk a lot about his work. Since I left, he has been promoted as a manager and has 6 people working for him. He's been complaining that he doesn't have enough resources, and due to budget cuts, he can't hire new team members. After resigning from the company, I've started my own business for 4 years in a different location. We have been negotiating for 4-5 months last year on how we should let our relationship get to the next level. Our final decision was that I would move in with him and shut down my business. In return, he will be paying my living expenses for relocating, giving up my career, and I will take on household chores if I don't get a job.Ok, sorry for the long background story. So last year in June, when he was talking about lacking resources, I asked him what if I went back as an intern? They had difficulty in getting actual headcounts for normal positions, but applying for an intern might be easier. My skills are rusty from the 4 year gap in between, but I'd still be a lot more useful than a real intern, and I can use the opportunity to pick up my skills and fill the gap on my resume.They setup an interview for me, my old boss told me that they would be glad to have me back, but they need some time until the internship opens up.I've moved in with him for 2 weeks by now. Yesterday, one of his team members resigned, he and his boss were discussing how they could borrow some resources from other teams, when his boss said \"and you said that you didn't need the intern opening when I said it was available\". I asked him when he made up his mind that he wouldn't be hiring me even when the position opens up. He replied \"I thought you knew that arrangement would be impossible since we are together now.\"I totally understand that it's difficult to mix work and relationships. He's the manager, I'm 100% aware that he should make the best decision for his team. However, that interview happened after we got together, if he knew that this wasn't a good arrangement, he should've up front told me instead of playing me like that.We had the talk, I've expressed myself, he doesn't think of the situation that way, he thinks that there was just never an event that triggered him to feel that he should say anything to me. For example, he said that if my boss explicitly asked him to notify me that the position had opened up, he would have told my boss to assign me to another manager. But offering him a intern, he did not see as a sufficient event to discuss his change of mind with me.Though feeling a bit played, I decided to swallow it. He is the manager, nobody owes me the honesty, it was never official yet, I don't need this specific job. However, he's either still processing his emotions or trying to give me the silent treatment for telling him that I feel played and thinks I've hurt him. AITA?",

I also didn't mind him experimenting with different drugs like shrooms or acid as long as he’s with friends that are dependable. However, how excited he is to take different substances worry me. He’s very open to trying out things, even if they are actually harmful and addictive. Today, he came to me to ask if I would be comfortable if he tried coke at a mutual friend’s birthday party. I flat out told him no, and that it would be stupid to dabble into something so dangerous willingly on his own. He insisted that it would be such a small amount that it would be fine, and as long as he only took it once he wouldn’t be addicted. I still said no, and he said alright, but was visibly disappointed. I don’t think he would do it while I’m so harshly am against it, but I’m starting to feel bad for not letting him. Am I overreacting by being so against him trying it?

	"body" : "I (18M) am a trans man (FtM) and have been out and proud for years. I'm very lucky to have an accepting and supportive mom. My brothers on the other hand are pretty die-hard Christians and in turn are homophobic. I knew that, and already accepted they'd never accept me as who I am and will forever misgender and dead name me. I accepted it because they've been the best older brothers all my life, and I want them to continue to be a part of my life.Now an issue has arisen and I'm so torn and it's stressing me out. Both of my brothers are getting married to my two future SIL's in the same year, one in spring and one in fall.  My SIL's are the same in terms of being a die-hard christian and in turn homophobic, but thankfully they nor my brothers have ever said anything rude/offensive directly to me. My brother that's getting married in the spring, his fiancé came to me and asked me to be one of her bridesmaids. Not long after, my other SIL asked me the same thing, but she acknowledge me being trans for once, and gave me an option. Either I agree to be one of her bridesmaids and unfortunately wear a dress and be forced to be the girl I'm not, or simply not be in the wedding party and then can show up in slacks and dress shirt.Neither pressured me into answering right away, and I still haven't but I'm so stressed on what to do. Here's the explanation for my likely confusing title. I'm thinking that if I deny to be a bridesmaid just so I can be myself and not uncomfortable and hating every moment, that I'd be the asshole to both my brothers and their fiancé's for not being in their wedding party when they asked me to be. But then, would I be the asshole to myself if I agree to be their bridesmaid and force myself to be someone I'm not, and forever remember the weddings as miserable as I wear a dress and makeup, being misgendered by everyone and forever being framed and posted as such forever? Am I just the asshole no matter what I choose?I've cried over this several times and I can't come to a decision. I'd love more than anything to be in my brothers' weddings, but on their side. So not being in the wedding at all would hurt me so much, but at the same time I hate the idea of forcing myself to be someone I'm not just to appease them... What should I do? I don't think there's any alternate choice so which would be less asshole-ish?Ending Note: I wrote this in present tense, but this actually happened a while ago and the weddings are said and done. I'm just curious what others think I should have done and which option would be less of an asshole move. I'll update this post later on about the decision I ended up making and how it went over. Thank yall!Edit: I was abt to update this but more comments have started rolling in so I'll wait a bit, but I won't have room to make the update on this post so it'll have to be a separate one unfortunately. I suppose if you're interested in the outcome, watch out for an update post later today <3",

I wasn’t aware her budget was so low, when we were looking she never specified a price range. I apologized for offending her but I feel she’s overreacting especially since she didn’t tell me her budget. AITA here?",

My grandma had passed earlier in the year and my mom was kind of depressed. With that being said I still made sure I asked if my mom wanted to do anything for Christmas. My mom told me no she wasn't in the Christmas spirit. I understood this and didn't press.So my girlfriend who I had met in July was going on vacation with her family on Christmas Day. She was being overly emotional but I tried make her feel at ease. She wanted to see me Christmas Eve and I told her I would free up my schedule for her.My mom got a change and decided FAMILY FIRST! to which my mom said she wanted to spend time with me on Christmas Eve. I said to her Christmas Eve was filled can we do Christmas. She said I could come home with her but id have to get myself back. They was fine except my mom lived really far and  Christmas was a Sunday so no buses were going to take me home the day after Christmas my mom yelled at me that her needs were not met and if she feels like this again she'd consider cutting me offYeah I know right so let's fast forward 9 months to September 2023 it's Thursday night the eagles were playing the Vikings I had on my GIGANTIC headphones because I was talking to my girlfriend and I was on indeed looking for a job. My mom came into the living room and starts talking to me about her best friend. How she was not in alignment with a lot of her choices. My mom was just completely ignoring my set up. Yet I tried to put in my 2 cents when needed. But I couldn't keep up with her questions and story. So me Mom says to me you're being rude. I told her that I was doing stuff, and that's when She then stormed off.The next day I spoke with my mom about what happened I told her that it wasn't okay for her to demand I give her time when I'm in the middle of something. She told me if it were my girlfriend I would have made time for her. I explained that I was in the middle of something and you were emotionally dumping on me (something that she had done my whole life) that is she needed me she could just ask me if I was free to talk so I could give her my attention. My mom told me that she REFUSES TO DO THAT BECAUSE SHE'S SICK OF ME NOT BEING AVAILABLE FOR HER!!!! my mom then said fine I won't talk to you at all. I asked my mom which one of us is the parent and she needed to grow up am I the asshole?",

Last semester she dated a guy who I had physical evidence that he cheated on her and we both knew he just wanted to physical intimacy with her. When they did and he told his friends what they did (like boys do) she told everyone that he did it wrongfully. Over the holiday break she got too drunk at a bar with her parents and snapped. She got in a fight with her mom and screamed at random people in the bar. She was arrested but now her family is getting it expunged (they're loaded $$). I should state that she is an only child and perfect in her parent's eyes. This last week her mother has been at our house 24/7 just sitting on the couch watching tv all day and drinking wine. When I got home the other night I was tired and wanted to be left alone. I went into my room but before I did her mom begged me to hang out with them. When I said no and went into my room she chased me and screamed through the door and hitting it saying that I am a terrible person for not calling her daughter to check on her over break.

	"title" : "AITA For Saying My Brother Was Acting Like A Crybaby?",
	"body" : "My brother (28M) and I (26NB) live together with our parent. I do most of the housework, including cooking meals. Two days ago my brother said he wanted to cook, and we were cool with that. He just had to clean up after himself and wash the dishes. We have a dishwasher, so he would just have to use that.He cooked yesterday, and that's where the first issue came up. Because of the way our kitchen is set up I put the dish soap and the dishwasher detergent next to each other on the counter. While he finished making the meal and cleaning up messaged me a bunch of questions, like if the chicken he cooked was still raw, where to put the dish detergent in the dishwasher, what button to press to start the dishwasher.At a certain point I just get up and directly show him what to do. The dishwasher starts running, and things seem to be going smoothly. That is until soap suds start pooling out of the washer on to the floor. He put dish soap into the dishwasher instead of detergent.I brought it up with him, and, though I was admittingly frustrated, I tried to stay calm. I didn't raise my voice, no ad hominem attacks, using my \"I\" statements and all that. He said he used the wrong solution because the dish soap didn't have a label. But it did, and so did the dish detergent. He ended up leaving before I could do more than bring up the issue and ask him to clean up the mess it made, which he later just threw a towel on.This morning I was going to do dishes when I saw how he organized the dishwasher. One of the pans was placed face up, so it collected a gallon or so of water. I tried taking it out without spilling, but of course it did. I was frustrated, and started swearing to myself about how \"isn't it common sense to put it face down.\" That's when my brother came in to ask what was up. Now I was frustrated, but I was really trying not to be aggressive or yell or anything. I had to take a deep breath, which could have come off as a snarky sigh tbh.Me: In the future put the pans facing down otherwise it collects water and-He cut me off, and I can't remember what he said verbatim. It was something like \"what do you want me to do about it now\" and like.. man, I was steaming, but I tried just continuing to explain why you have to put the pot face down, but he started walking away downstairs.Him: I'm sorry. I do everything wrong. Me: Don't start pulling that crybaby self pity- Him: I'm not. I know I did it wrong.He ended up just leaving and going out to shovel snow, and I know he tends to do physical activity when he's mad. I get taking space when one is angry so they don't say/do something they regret, but it feels like this always happens. He does something, I try to talk to him about it, he gets defensive and runs off. Now I'm just sitting here mixed with frustration and guilt. Am I the asshole here?",

Then my mom comes in for something insignificant. Maybe to hand me some laundry she did (which I'm very thankful for that she does it for me) or just to check if I'm asleep or to say good night. Sounds very kind so far.The problem is, every time I get a huge shock because I don't hear her entering. And every time, I tell her that it's because of the music I'm listening to on my headphones that I don't hear her come in, and that I would like her not to do it anymore. She can text me if she wants something, as it's really probable that on my phone when I'm chilling in my room. I just happen to like listening to music on my headphones, so I won't hear her knocking at the door. (Even if I do hear her knocking, it's not like she waits for a reply, she's more like: \"I knocked three times and you didn't say anything so I came in!\")She keeps doing this and I keep telling her that I don't like it. She doesn't like it when I want to choose things like that. When I was small, she wouldnt even let me close the doors to my room all the way shut. Which I get, for safety reasons maybe. But even a small child should get the space to be truly alone and in private for some time, especially  if the child wants it.She tells me that I have a \"problem\", that I should take my \"stupid\" headphones out, or that I should \"grow up\". Now I'm thinking about locking the door every time I don't want to be bothered or surprised out of nowhere, because she keeps not accepting it.You guys think that that'd be too much?(edit: added my age)",

	"title" : "WIBTA If I go to a music festival but tell my cousin that I’m not going",
	"body" : "My cousin and I have been going to the same music festival for several years now as a sort of tradition. The first few years were a blast but the last two years were less than fun.The tickets are pretty expensive so for me to justify the price, I like to be there from the very first song to the very last one. I also like to try to see as many bands as I can versus seeing them from the best view, so I’m not always willing to skip someone to get closer To the stage for someone else. My cousin has always had no problem with going along with my little rules (which I’m willing to break if it makes sense).The issue with the last two years was that we started going with his friends. I like his friends but they don’t really go along with my preferences above. We showed up late the last two years which was fine because I didn’t really miss anyone.But we’ve also missed some smaller acts who I would’ve liked to see but we didn’t because they wanted to be center front stage for the next band at a different stage. I don’t mind watching someone by myself but my cousin feels bad if i go off on my own. However, I also know he wants to go along with what his friends are doing so I don’t try to separate from them.Then last year we missed the end of the night headliners because one of them started feeling sick and I had driven everyone in so I needed to leave to get them home. I was pretty upset about this one because the headliners concert tickets are crazy expensive regularly and basically this was my best chance of seeing them live.This year my cousin has already talked about us going with his friends again but honestly I just want to go for the music, even if it’s by myself. I feel like it would be really mean to say I’m only going if we don’t go with his friends, so the only other thing I can think of is saying I can’t go this year and just go by myself and hopefully not run into any of them. Would I be the asshole if I did this?Edit: It probably won’t change anyone’s mind but I don’t think I was very clear about why I would rather avoid talking about this with my cousin. You see while the last two years weren’t as good for me, I can tell that they were really fun for my cousin. My cousin is really nice and if I were to tell him that id rather not go with his friends, I know he would automatically say he has no problem with not going with them (even though he’s clearly excited about it). But if I tell him I’m just going to go by myself he would also feel bad about that. I know lying is wrong but either way I just think my cousin would end up upset, which is what I’m trying to avoid.UPDATE: Since the overwhelming response was that it would be an asshole move, I decided I would tell him the truth... it didn’t go as well as I would’ve liked. When I got home from work there were already plans being discussed in a group chat so I thought it would be best to let him know how I felt. Basically I adlibbed some of the script that was written in the comments. I told my cousin that I love going to the music festival with him and I do like his friends but I don’t like going to the music festival as a group with them. I let him know that I was a little disappointed the past few years because of what I said above. And because he seemed to have so much fun with his friends, I thought that maybe the best thing would be that I go there by myself and I can meet up with him and his friends throughout the day so that we can all enjoy the festival the way we like.I knew he would be a little bummed about it but I figured he would be okay with it since he would still be seeing me but also still get to hang out with his friends all day. However, instead he got really upset; he said that it felt like I was making him choose between me or his friends. I tried to explain that I was hoping to still hang out with everyone even though I was planning on going on my own schedule. That didn’t really work because he said “even so, I feel like you’re trying to abandon me”.  I felt really crappy after the phone call. My cousin is really upset about the whole thing and i feel like a giant jerk.But judging by how upset he is by the truth, I’m sure if I did what I had wanted to do and he found out it would’ve gone even worse. So basically I avoided the asshole move and still ended up being an asshole.",

I'll call the family member \"Jeff.\"I was asked to clean up my bathroom, which I did except for my shower/tub which had draining issues and needed to be fixed. Jeff texted me asking if I had cleaned yet, which I had been over the past 2 days.I had responded hours late as I was about to work and apologized, saying I don't look at my phone all the time. I had put my phone on mute to focus as I work from home, and that's when hell broke loose.For context, we live in the same house. From death in the family, I was left inheritance and the current house in my name. Working through all the mess and legal mambo is still ongoing and was put on hold as I was going through some other personal issues.We do not have a good relationship at all, as it is very toxic and verbally abusive, and he (in my opinion) shows narcissistic traits. Because I have the house in my name, he's been asking for me to add him to the title so he can feel safer, as he fears an event where I ask him to leave the property, no longer having a place to stay.During the time I wasn't looking at my phone, Jeff sent paragraphs of not feeling disrespected by late replies, berating me in text and saying he will ignore me because of me responding late. I didn't respond to that until the next day and told him I answered him back and apologized.I said further that late responses to text aren't disrespecting, and him stating he will ignore me is the behavior of a child. My response ended with stating it is not my job to regulate his emotions, and I believe he needs to seek mental help for his history of outbursts and anger targeted at me.After sending the text, Jeff comes banging at my door, demanding an explanation of my text in frustration. He said I have zero respect for him, only care about myself, am an asshole for not getting him any gifts for his bday or holidays (I had no money and was a minor for the majority of the time we've lived together), would be worth nothing more than someone else's object of pleasure and to be taken advantage of.He tied his rant back to cleaning, and claimed I did nothing, as there were a few spots missing and some leftover dust in a hard-to-reach corner of my bathroom. I ask Jeff to stop yelling, he tells me to get over myself. He says I am an asshole because I don't care for him in the way he wants to be cared for and treat him like his mother did, referencing financial abuse between the two of them.As for context on the financial part, Jeff was receiving a fixed payment from my inheritance until I turned 18. The payments stopped after I graduated from high school. Jeff was upset the payments stopped, and blamed me for it happening, when that's part of the law. He claimed he had planned using said payments for several years ahead until I turned 25, and had been going into debt knowing he had the payments to rely on.So, am I the asshole?",

My boyfriend (28 M: let’s call him James) and I have been living together for almost a year, and been together for 2 . I recently worked a stretch of 3 nights, with one night off, followed by another 4 nights. To say I’m exhausted is an understatement. James works a typically 9-5 office job and has a fair amount of free time in the evenings. I’ll admit I’m not always the cleanest person and often leave clothes everywhere, don’t always do my dishes immediately, and just generally forget to pick things up. When I’m not working a stretch, I try to be a lot more conscious of this and do my best to pick up the house more. When I am working a stretch, however, this all sort of goes out the window- and it’s nothing crazy, just maybe forgetting to put a few things away or leaving dishes in the sink. My issue is that when I come home from work and I’m mentally, physically and emotionally drained- the house is a mess. Everything is exactly how I left it, but with the addition of his dishes in the sink and his stuff laying around. Coming home to a messy house is really stressful to me. I understand that my mess is my own problem, and I’m not expecting him to necessarily clean up after me- just to make a little more of an effort to clean when he knows I’m working a lot. I tried talking to him about it by just mentioning how much I’d appreciate it if he cleaned one day while I was asleep before working another shift. He was fully taken aback and responded with “sure I guess….” Followed by “well you didn’t clean this past week when you weren’t working, so I’m just confused why you expect me to clean.” For the record, I hadn’t cleaned that week, but my childhood pet had passed away at the beginning of the week and I was feeling really down.TLDR: am I the asshole for wanting my boyfriend to clean up a little more when I’m working a stretch of night shifts?",

Since then I have put A LOT of effort into styling and decorating the house (like 99% of the effort). He is a stereotypical straight man in his 20s in the sense that the house would probably have little to no decor if he lived alone simply because decor is not an interest of his or a priority. It means a lot to me to have a space I feel good in and proud of. I feel like it’s important to note that he often says how nice the house looks and whenever our friends come over we receive lots of compliments which makes us feel proud and blessed.This past fall, my fiancé went hunting and shot his first ever moose, and this thing was huge! With that being said, his dad has put the antlers on a plaque for him as a sort of trophy.My fiancé is wanting to put this plaque on top of the fireplace in our living room. It’s important to note that our home is not huge, and these antlers are huge. They would be seen all of the time from all of the main living areas of the house (front entrance, living room, kitchen, dining room, back entrance, etc).I’m proud of him and feel bad about shutting down this idea, but at the same time I put so much thought and effort into the look of our home and I know it would drive me nuts to have to look at it every single day. I’m not opposed to having them hung in the house, just not as the center of the home.My compromise was to put it in the basement, or the dining room, or the spare bedroom which is entirely his.

	"body" : "There’s this girl, Jane (F18), who’s in a few of my (M18) classes at uni, and my friends and I sometimes hang out with her. Jane is really nice, but unfortunately, she has a lot of confidence issues when it comes to her looks. Don’t get me wrong; I think she looks fine. Most people think she’s pretty. However, for whatever reason, Jane is convinced she’s horribly ugly.Jane says a lot of self-deprecating humour about her looks, and for a good while, I thought she was just messing around. However, her friend, Kate (F18), told me that she was serious, and honestly, after paying closer attention, this became clear to me as well.So last night, I was hanging out with Jane, Kate, their other friends Maggie (F18) and Sophie (F19), and my friends Eric (M18) and Zak (M18). I don't know what was different about last night, but Jane didn’t seem too happy and was making several comments about how she looked, like she normally does.Whenever she does this in the past, Eric, Zak, and her friends will say things like “No, you’re pretty” or something similar. You get the idea. Whenever they look at me to say something, I always say something neutral, like “You look normal” or “You don’t look bad,” or I’ll shrug. Eric and Zak have told me privately in the past that I should probably say something nicer. Kate and Maggie even told me that I should, since they think I’m hard to please, and Jane would really appreciate hearing it from me because of that. I honestly don’t see the point, as whatever caused Jane to be like this can’t be solved with positive affirmation, imo.So last night, after everyone was calling her pretty and such, she kept looking over at me, and I was just like “You look tired and should probably moisturize your skin.” It was a perfectly honest observation at the time because she did look tired and her skin looked dry (its been cold the last few days so that’s probably why).Jane didn’t look happy with my response, and someone sort of changed the topic. When I was going back to my dorm with Eric, he told me that Jane was probably really upset that I didn’t say she was good-looking or something. When I told him that words weren’t really going to do anything for Jane and that she needed to change her mindset about overvaluing looks, he said that I was being a bit of a dick.AITA?Edit - I showed this post to my roommate \"Eric\" and he said I should also add in the point I had made to him in the past which was: One day I (OP) will say something nice about Jane's looks and since I've been dismissive about them so far, she'll probably fall head-over-heels for me.I forgot about saying that, but I largely said it as a joke. I don't really see what it adds though...Edit - For those wondering, she looks perfectly fine, there isn't anything wrong with how she looks. It really is just that she thinks she isn't pretty.",

Fast forward a few years.My husband and I had been married for 2 1/2 years and I was stationed overseas in Japan and forward deployed which meant we were gone about 300 days a year. It was fast approaching the holidays and I was off the ship for 6 weeks recovering from foot surgery. It was suggested for me to take leave over thanksgiving instead of Christmas since I was technically off the ship anyways.So my husband and I change our plans. Tell his parents who had plans to attend their dad’s (who had passed 20 year’s previously) twin brothers 75 birthday party in Florida. They live in CT.We made plans to visit them. We told them due to the flight and all that we wouldn’t be attending the trip to Florida with them. We were really bummed. But long story short our return trip would have been a 24 hour drive in my old car that his dad had been driving. Then getting on an international flight back to Japan. We were only home for like 8 days it just wasn’t going to be done.Thank God we didn’t drive it either because his dads car broke down while we driving. Around town. The family was obviously mad that we didn’t go with them. Understandable. They had driven to Florida in their car. My husband and I went to drop the car off at the dealership and asked sil if we could borrow her car to drive behind then head home. She was on the trip with her parents. She said No. it was weird to us because we’re like we’re trying to help out your parents but whatever you say no. So we are getting ready to leave and there is a knock at the door. The boyfriends brother to my sil is at the door saying oh I need to get something from her room. I’ll be right back. Turns out he came over to get the keys just to make sure we didn’t drive her car.My husband and I drove the dads car to the dealership and paid for all the repairs because the dad had been laid off from his job. This was the car we would have driven to Florida if we had gone. They were upset that we didn’t go to Florida with them. Which is why my sil was being so rude to us.Probably am an asshole for poor writing. I think I fixed it up more. But essentially my husband’s parents were actually pissed we didn’t go on the trip with them To Florida. They wanted us to drive the dads car. Which broke down and we would have been stranded on the road. It was a crazy repair. We we’re grateful we didn’t do the drive to Florida. But disappointed that we took the dads car to the dealership and paid for the repairs. His sister was 17 ish  at the time and we were 24 and 22. Still young kids ourselves. Who didn’t have a  ton of money. But paid for repairs to a car that wasn’t our responsibility. But we cared about them to help them out.We stayed the whole thanksgiving time and never saw his immediate family. Because they were gone our whole trip home. The trip was ok and nice to meet with others in the family. But really wished we could have seen them and didn’t have to deal with the drama.Edit context- this was 2008 circa. No Ubers. No smart phones and my husband and I were too young to rent a car. We were doing his parents a favor by fixing their broke car and paying for it. Asking his teenage sister to borrow the car to help us to help his parents shouldn’t be viewed as being difficult. They were mad because we didn’t go on the trip to Florida with them which is what they wanted. But we also didn’t have the finances after buying our own flights from japan where I was a lowly E4. and my husband made 12$/ hour. More context.Edit I don’t know how to fix this post to make it more legible. My husband and I had not been home in almost 3 years. The military forced me to change my Vacation time. Husbands family had a different trip planned and we didn’t have enough money, or physical time to travel for only 8 days home. The expectation for us was to do whatever possible to travel to Florida with them and when we didn’t do that they gave us a hard time.",

	"body" : "Am I the asshole for this? I've been talking to this guy for a couple of weeks and things have been going pretty well. He's been majorly flirting with me and we've kissed quite a few times. He picked me up one night and we were fooling around for at least 2 hours, when told he me the next day that he doesn't want anything serious. At first I'm pretty upset about it because he just lead me on, but then I decide to listen to his reasoning on why he doesn't want anything. He tells me that it's because I've called his whole friendgroup hot. For backstory, I only started messaging this guy last month, and I've known his friends for almost a year if not more. Yes, I called one of them hot during the summer time, but I never spoke to him again. I called the other one hot two weeks before me and this guy started flirting. Again, I never spoke to him again. The guy I'm talking to finds a way to bring it up in every conversation, even though I called them hot before I even knew he existed. Saying I called his whole friend group (which consists of more than 10 people) hot is crazy to me. It was only two of them. Anyways, last night I went onto vsco which is a media platform that all of my friends use. I checked the pictures he's been reposting, and what do I see? Girls ass pics. Why would he get mad at me for doing something months ago, but repost ass pics of other girls now???",

When they asked me and my brother (17M) what we would want in the new house, my only demand was good wifi.This was important because i was (not anymore) a professional gamer and they knew this. They said this new house had good wifi, so i agreed to move. And when we finally moved in and got settled they said they’d call the company that installed the wifi. Well… to say the least it hasn’t been installed at all. When I frequently asked them about it, they said they’d call the company.So last week i asked them again, and the same thing was said. I told them: “Are you sure? Because you have told me this for 2,5 years now and I’m getting tired of waiting.” They responded “it’s not that deep…” and this quickly escalated into a whole discussion. It basically ended in them telling me: “if you don’t like it, then you can just move out, you’re old enough.” I stormed off and haven’t spoken to them at all.So, please help me out on what to do.",

I am also 36 weeks pregnant, and for those of you unfamiliar it is very common for your bellybutton to turn into an outie when in your third trimester.Anyway, we were trying on our bridesmaid dresses two days ago, and mine is obviously pretty snug now, which causes my bellybutton to jut out under the fabric. Sarah noticed this and, in what was realistically a pretty polite manor, admitted to me that the site of bellybuttons makes her uncomfortable. I told her I was sorry but there wasn't really anything I could do about it, the dresses are just tight fit. She mentioned one of her other friends uses these little pads for pregnant women that look kind of like a band aid, you put them over your bellybutton to \"flatten\" it out so it doesn't stick out from under your clothing. She asked me if I wouldn't mind using one for the actual wedding day.It seemed like a pretty bizarre request but I didn't really want to go against her so I just offered to try. They came in today, I tried them and they are SUPER uncomfortable. Like it was itchy wearing it for just 5 minutes, let alone for an entire day at her wedding lol.I texted her telling her that they were too uncomfortable, and just got a \":/\" in reply. I also explained the situation to my husband but he told me I was being an asshole and should just suck it up and deal with it for the one day, and that I was going to be uncomfortable anyway.I get it that she's my friend and it's her wedding day and I want her to be happy but this just seems like a crazy over the top thing to ask right?INFO: Seeing this a lot in the comments, modifications to the dress (sash, etc) are a no go.

I told her that, and she looked upset. She said I could have told her while she was making the eggs. I said I was sorry, I forgot. She was acting like I was just being a picky eater and not appreciative of her gesture.Honestly her reaction freaked me out a bit because it seemed so over the top. But I’m still feeling bad about it and wondering if AITA here for refusing it.edit:additional info. A lot of people asked for more information about what we actually said and how things transpired: I was in the kitchen and could see she was breaking eggs into the pan, but wasn’t paying attention as we were talking about other things. So I saw she was making eggs but didn’t notice what kind; she didn’t ask me how I’d like them and I also didn’t remember to ask. I only noticed it was sunny side up when we sat down to eat.I said: “oh baby, I forgot you didn’t know, I have a thing with runny eggs”. She didn’t say anything for a second, then grab the plate and went back to the pan. I told her I could do it, but she told me she’d do it. She came back like 1 minute later and I told her thanks. And then I noticed she seemed upset. I asked her what was the matter. She said I could have told her how I liked my eggs. That’s when I said I’m sorry, I forgot. And I then she said: I didn’t know you were such a picky eater - and remained upset for most of our breakfast, while I tried to change the subject.I thought her reaction (even getting upset with something so minor) was indeed over the top and that’s the first time I see her behave like this.

Now, I don't mind this as my hair is usually up anyways. However, the problem is here - you see, I normally have my hair up in either a claw clip ponytail or bun; but my grandma doesn't like this and says I look homeless or something else.This pisses me off so much as I'm not even allowed to have my hair however IN MY OWN HOME (or my parents' you get the point). I have my hair and stuff how she wants whenever I go to India to see her, but the fact that even though my hairstyle solves her problem of open hair she isn't letting me is beyond irritating. She wants me to go wear a hair-tie instead and when I come out with a bun, she gets mad again and makes me do a ponytail.Not to sound bratty but I don't like hair-ties because I have mid-length hair and it hurts my head too much which is why I wear a claw clip instead. But anytime she sees my hair either open or in a claw clip starts screaming at my mom about how she isn't controlling me enough and that she isn't a good mother. Why?

	"body" : "I, 26F, am in my first serious relationship with my boyfriend (28M). I currently am living at home with my parents with one sister, 28F, and my oldest sister, 30F, moved out. This past Christmas, my boyfriend and I decided to go on our first trip together (2N3D) over Christmas weekend to celebrate the holidays, in which we would be back home morning of Christmas Day.  He just recently started a new job, so he could not take the day off the Friday before so that we could come back Sunday morning (Christmas Eve) instead.We booked this trip 2 months in advance and I told my parents when we had first booked the trip to let them know I would not be able to have dinner with them on Christmas Eve (My mom works on Christmas Day so they decided to have dinner the night before Christmas). Thus, I celebrated Christmas early with my parents the Friday before and they decided to spend Christmas with my sisters on Christmas Eve.My 28F sister also planned a trip with her boyfriend to go overseas over the weekend, but needed to come back Christmas Eve as she she had to work on Christmas Day, which I did not find out until weeks after I had already booked our trip.Fast forward to the morning of Christmas Eve, I get a message from my 30F sister essentially yelling at me saying that I don't care about family, and that I chose my boyfriend over my family, and that \"I ruined Christmas for the family\", and that she wouldn't have gotten mad if my 28F sister didn't come back home Christmas Eve since \"when would she ever be overseas\" (28F sister had said she would have spent Christmas Eve overseas if it weren't for work.). I feel like this is such a hypocritical opinion because all in all, a trip is a trip. Distance of destination shouldn't be the forgiving factor. To give context, I have a very broken relationship with my 30F sister. I've been bullied by her since childhood, and we argue every time there is a family dinner, even as adults. I'm sick and tired of arguing with her at this point in life, but she always finds ways to nitpick on what I do.I talked to my mom about this situation, and she doesn't think I am in the wrong. She said relationships are important too and that my sister just doesn't understand because she's never been in a serious relationship before, and that she'll be more understanding once she does.I wanted to get away from the house for the first time since I moved back home, and really didn't think it was such a big issue I spent one holiday away from home. We had just had a family dinner early December to celebrate my parent's wedding anniversary, so it's not like family dinners are a rare occurrence.  I WFH and have dinner with my parents every night. Reason I bring this up 1 month after the fact is because my 30F is still angry at me and still messaging me about it, and is saying she's cutting me out of her life, saying \"she has better things in life to do than talk to me\".AITA?",

I don't know why this semester is like this. Point being is that I am extremely stressed at the moment and I really don't think I can handle the anxiety of going to that party. I told her that I probably won't go and I told her that it's because I don't really know anybody from her group and that I'm really stressed and more social anxiety on top of that is going to finish me. She said that this is not an excuse and that she wants me to go.

I told her that he is himself and not me. I suggested we go for a coffee for a bit to celebrate but she doesn't want to. She insists and I told her I'll think about it.

First, the teacher simply said we must pick a non-fiction book to base our assignment on. I only live near one library. My mom went to that one and got me a biography, as the workers literally said those were the only non-fiction books available. I brought it in, only for the teacher to then say \"no biographies\". I was luckily able to lie to my teacher about my topic, and she didn't even bother to check. Sadly, another kid who also had a biography got detention as the teacher was able to see he had a biography. We also have a school library but she said that for this assignment we aren't allowed to use any non-fiction books from there.I didn't have any other choice but to use this old computer at my house to use the Internet for information about the topic I said. Nobody else could have the same topic as each other. The rubric mentioned nothing about citations as it was presumed that only the book would be used for information.She also made a rule that she wouldn't take any points off for having photos sticking out of the board. I had been relieved about this. However, everyone else got their essays back, while she kept mine back. Even kids who handed in their essays late and got marks off for it got their essays back before mine. I raised my hand to try to bring this to her attention, but she just gave me a look and turned away. The students were waiting to ask the teacher questions, so I stood with them. When it was my turn, I said \"Hello\" and then she asked in an irritated voice \"What do you want?\" I then politely pointed out that I didn't get my essay back. She then said in an irritated voice \"Can you wait?\" Then, she called me in for a meeting after class about my essay. I felt nervous and tried not to cry, but my eyes were watery. She then screamed at me, asking me \"What is this behavior? Stop this behavior now!\" cause she saw the water in my eyes. I then said, \"yes m'am\".She began to rant, asking \"What is this?\" then she proceeded to compare my work with my peers work who did better work and talked about their work.

We usually sit together in one class, photography. We used to sit at a different table but my sister begged me to move because he made an off comment.

I've told her that I would tell him for her but she begged me not to and claimed that she's afraid of confrontation and doesn't like setting boundaries.A really important thing to note is, Johnny shows a lot of symptom's of autism and is currently in the process of getting a diagnosis. This is important because he has a hard time with social cues, one such example in this is him not getting she's uncomfortable, and this is amplified by her pretending that she's his friend + she refuses to talk to him about it.The part that really upsets me is that she constantly complains about Johnny's actions and Johnny in general, and also really wants me to move tables with her again still doesn't want to express this to him.WIBTA if I told Johnny my sisters boundaries?TLDR; Friend makes sister uncomfortable, sister doesn't want to tell him but doesn't want me to either and badmouths him for it.",

I decided to ignore her because she did the same to me. Looking back on it, she was really toxic, she almost broke my neck, slammed my head into a locker, peer pressured me, allowed her gf to tell me that my mental illness and autism diagnosis was fake, and hit my eye with a rubber band and then laughed in my face when I cried. I feel bad that I ignored her but my friend says I did the right thing. Am I the asshole?Update: Now, I blocked her, I told her how she made me feel and how she can't keep friends if she's acting like that and I typed her a big paragraph on how she made me feel and how she could change and if she wasn't gonna change our friendship could no longer continue and she said she wasn't gonna read all of it, and I confronted her for always having lazy excuses and she said to block her because she's not gonna change.

	"body" : "I f28 overheard a conversation between my husband m35 and SIL f27 about money. Basically, heard him saying “I will let you know tomorrow that I get paid” I automatically thought, this girl asked for money. A little bit of more information to add - my SIL works up north and gets paid very well, she has no kids, no responsibilities other than her car payment..(she gets per-diem for food and rent) she recently asked for a week off to go to our hometown for legal reasons and visit her mom. Apparently, they haven’t called her to come back to work so she’s staying with my MIL.. it’s already been 2 weeks and still no news about her getting back to work. I honestly thought she had enough money saved up.. now when I overheard this conversation I didn’t say anything I was in the middle of my nap so I just continued sleeping.. when I woke up I got curious and checked my husbands phone, she asked him for $600. I’m extremely confused as into why so much money, if she’s staying with her mom atm, she told me yesterday that she had just spent over $700 on ozempic injections, she also told us last week that she went on a shopping spree with her mom.. so I’m just not sure I want to lend her any money. I’m mostly concerned about the fact that we are on a tight budget trying to get ahead on payments for when I give birth.. oh yeah, FYI I am pregnant with twins (boy & girl) and due date is in 7 weeks and we haven’t even bought a car seat for the boy. I’m slowly bringing things from our storage that we saved from my daughter now 13 months old, but we still need to buy extra things for the baby boy.. We have money in our savings but I don’t think it’s really fair seeing how she’s been spending her money knowing she needed to save up until she got called back to work or at least be prepared if they didn’t. I don’t know what my husbands thoughts are on this.. he hasn’t mentioned it to me and I don’t want to bring it up either.. at this point I’m too pregnant to be worrying about other people. I feel that if he ends up lending her money without talking to me about it,  I’d get very annoyed. So, am I being an AH?",

I discussed it with my mom and she understood and talked to her sister about it. My grandma and aunt felt the same way, they said I got engaged first so why would I change the date of my wedding. So my aunt talked to her son and his fiance about changing the date. She won’t budge and is still not going to change the date. Since my aunt has a son she thinks she can’t force her to change it since weddings are things women care more about. So now I’m upset cause our weddings are 2 weeks apart. I had the date set way before they got engaged anyway and just think having a wedding that close is going to be so chaotic and not even fun for my family.

I am with my girlfriend for 1,5 years now and she expected to be invited to the wedding as it is very common in her country (and also usual in mine) to attend a wedding as a couple. A wedding is a celebration of love, after all. Last week I received an invitation addressed only to me. When I asked my friend to bring my girlfriend, he said no due to space constraints and he also made the argument that people who don't have a partner would then feel obligated to bring a date to the wedding. He and his wife don't know my girlfriend, because we live in different cities and when we wanted to meet last time, they cancelled on us last minute. In general it has become harder to meet up with him since he is in this relationship. I said this was fine and totally up to him, but added that we wouldn't invite his wife to our wedding. He just laughed at me, because he probably mistook it as a joke. My girlfriend is sad, but urges me to go to the wedding as she doesn't want me to risk our friendship over something like this. I am definitely attending, but unsure whether I should go through with not inviting my friends wife when I (hopefully) marry my girlfriend in maybe around 2 years.

	"title" : "AITA for telling my best friend not to undress in front of the camera while we video chat?",
	"body" : "Me and my best friend have regular video calls because we live in different states.We mostly have a call when my boyfriend is not around (I live with him), sometimes he is at home tho.When we video call, she sometimes undress herself, like changing clothes or when she feels too hot. She is not completely naked, but in underwear like panties or bra or sports bra.After the third time I told her not to do that because sometimes my boyfriend could walk past by.She said why? He is not there anyways. And I told her he is. She then said, its not a big problem, he would see her like this on the beach as well. I told her well its not the same and told her not to do that anymore.She used to do that too when I was living alone, which was fine for me, but now I am living with my boyfriend its something else.Also I told her she should always assume he is there even though he most of the time isnt, but I am not going to make an announcement everytime we talk, if he is there or not. Its not hard to turn the camera while dressing, what most people doShe said I am overreacting. I think I am not. I am requesting something really normal and she shouldnt do that regardless.AITA?Forgot to add: She asked me if I was jealous if my boyfriend would see her like this and undressing. I said no, its just normal not to do that.Edit: I read some of the comments by now and I find it super interesting to hear different opinions.First of all, yes I could have just turn off the camera by myself or switched to phone call. She undresses herself randomly without any warning and sometimes I just do stuff on the side, where there is no chance I can turn the screen immediately down or so.About the jealousy thing. That is not my point at all. When I lived by myself of course I wouldnt have a problem with her randomly undressing since there is only both of us and we are comfortable with each other. Now I am living with someone else, which is my partner, I also have to consider about him and it doesnt matter if its my boyfriend, my parents, my siblings or even another girl friend of mine. Not everyone wants to see someone undress and half naked. If I put this situation on me, I would never change my clothes in front of the camera, when I am not sure or clearly know that my friends boyfriend (or anyone else, her friend, parents etc.) are around and there could be a chance that they get a glimpse of me. For me that is not a normal thing to do. I just thought that also occurred to her when I moved out, that now we are not only two people here.About the that she is in her home, she can do whatever she wants. Yes, she can. But she doesnt need to do it in the video call. If shes at home naked all day I dont care, but if she lives on ground floor and has the window wide open, where everybody can see her naked. That is an issue.Last thing about the bikini. For me its not the same. Just because my colleagues and boss saw me in bikini before for whatever reason, doesnt mean that I need to show up like this to work. I guess that is just personal opinions.In the future I would consider phone calls over video calls, even tho we do prefer video calls.Thanks for all the imput.",

I texted my landlord at about 5:30 asking for a spare and then got caught up in hosting and drinking at the party. As the party was ending I realized I hadn't heard back from my landlord. So I reached out to the person i'm seeing and asked if I could stay over. I've been with this person on and off for about 3 years. For the sake of this story, i'll call them my partner. They told me they were headed out but suggested I go to a KeyMe kiosk (it stores copies of your keys that print on demand) which was perfect because I had zero intention of screwing with their plans. The problem was I didn't have my wallet, but I convened with them and they really helped me out. We decided that I would get cash from an ATM, to buy a gift card, to use on the KeyMe kiosk and they asked me to update them on my progress.I then spent about the next 3 hours walking across Manhattan. No stores would sell gift cards using google pay, the rest wouldn't sell them after 11pm, and when I finally did get one and made it to a 7/11 that was actually open, turns out the kiosk doesn't accept gift cards. So at this point, about 3am, I am nearly frozen & defeated and get on a train to head to a 24hr McDonalds. I hit my partner and ask if they're headed home, if i can stay over. They agreed and left Manhattan to meet me in Brooklyn where we both live. I stayed over, and next morning they went with me, bought my spare key and lunch the next day. They were amazing and I let them know I was infinitely grateful.Today the situation came up (for context, it was a digression from another conflict we were already having) and they accused me of being selfish that night. They feel like me not checking in with them like we agreed meant I had no regard for what they asked me to do and that was selfish. I explained to them that I did not want to bother them or screw with their plans that night in the first place and since i was confident (at the time) that there was a finish line in view, I figured would just let them know once I had the key.We went back and forth a bit and ultimately. I told them I completely understand their point about adhering to what we agreed on instead of doing something different regardless of my reason, and that I will be cognizant of that moving forward, but I don't agree with the assessment that I was being selfish when my intent was the very opposite. So I wouldn't concede to that label, which was upsetting to them. I argued that the substance of the point that they made was completely understood so whether or not it should be labelled as \"selfish\" is something that we can agree to disagree on. They do not see it this way and that further perpetuated the conflict we were already having. Am I the asshole?",

I never gave him my address, city, number or surname but his mother called me “his girlfriend”. This made me feel physically sick and confused. We also never made anything official.For context, I was needing support and this guy reached out to me and straight away he wasn’t my type at all. I didn’t like his looks, accent and that he was long distance and eventually would realise I don’t like his odd personality too. At first I kinda liked the attention and friendship we first had as I lack that irl, however, then he started saying he loved me, how I was the best person, how he would cuddle me, and sexual stuff, and wanted to meet me ect. He said he wouldn’t even care if his family heard sexual things from his room (yuck). I also declined his offer of sending me money and gifts. I don’t know why I was an idiot and went along with what he was saying for around 2 months, which I suppose played with his feelings and hurt him as it made him cry?I questioned why his mother called me his girlfriend, he said he didn’t know? And I reminded him multiple times that we weren’t dating. I also politely told him that he wasn’t my type and he said that I’ve turned him into a “cold person” and that he should ”lay in darkness forever”. He mentioned meeting, at first I was asking him about where we would meet how long ect knowing I likely wouldn’t meet up with him. He said I should come to his house for 3 months (which is crazy for the first time meeting) and he would pay for everything, and let me leave if I want to. But got angry when I said I wouldn’t feel safe flying overseas to meet him in a country that doesn’t speak English and that I would want my own separate hotel room, but then said he would be okay with it. But wouldn’t come to my country to meet me because it’s “not ideal”. He knows I’m neurodivergent and have bad social anxiety too, and a lot more vulnerable than him. He constantly mentioned/ pressured about us meeting despite me now making it clear that I don’t want to. And that I don’t want to be more than good friends.I had realised I went too far with this and began texting him less and less. I didn’t reply for a few hours because I was busy and I came back to 100+ messages from him. I mentioned the signs of love bombing he had shown and that I no longer want to associate with him or receive “loving” messages which I had already asked him to stop doing. Because of this, he was “stressed” and cut his finger “off” in his words and sent me a unwanted photo of the blood. A week or two later he blocked me for “pushing him away” and so did his sister. And his sister 24F assumed I was 17 (a child) dating her 20m brother for 2 months we obviously weren’t. He was extremely rude during our last interaction and swore at me and accusing me of lying about my problems because I told him that my family likely wouldn’t agree to us talking for my safety, even though he knows I’m not very close with them.There’s a chance he was likely doing this for attention from me too as he said he could easily find a “new” gf tomorrow if he wanted to…who lied to this guy? But then said he would potentially try to find me and he can’t help his “feelings for me”? Or just wanting me to send him pictures as he kept pestering me to but I didn’t.To make all of this worse, my sister 16F somehow read my messages with him and keeps saying he was my bf, and it’s quite upsetting for me because I would never go for a guy like him and especially because I’ve never had a bf before.

We have a 4yr old and 2yr old.He used to work full time and crazy hours especially during tax season, but was miserable so we decided he should use GI Bill to take classes full-time to get a bachelor's degree and then get a different job. He takes classes online and watches the kids while I'm at workI work M-F and am gone 8:30-12:30. The rest of the time I'm just on call. We live off my income but he does get money from the GI Bill and has partial disability from the army, so he does contribute financially. But there is no way we'd survive even a month without me working.We split the house responsiblies pretty evenly and he's really good about most of it. We have one area of contention - the laundry.I am happy to fold, hang, and put away all laundry. But I want it all done on Monday so I don't have to deal with it the rest of the week. So all I ask is all laundry be washed and in baskets by the time I get home on Monday at 12:30. I know this is possible to do, because when he was working full time, I did it everyday Saturday morning. Started laundry around 8am, and had everything washed before noon.But for some reason my husband cannot get it done on time. He loses track of time and never rotates anything, so when I get home it is a miracle if two of the four small loads are ready for me to fold/sort/hang. He has even started laundry on Sunday nights to try to get it done on time.....still no change. (Twice he actually HAS accomplished this, so yes it IS possible when he makes the effort to pay attention to timing.) But every Monday I end up upset because now I will have to do a load of laundry each day to keep up with everything. I'm so sick of it and I hate being mad at him for it.So, yesterday, when it happened again for the hundredth time, I told him from now on, I will keep my clothes separate, and he will be responsible for washing, folding, and putting away all other laundry, including our kids'. This way he can do it at his own pace and I don't have to worry about it and I'm no longer dependent on him doing his part.He's upset, saying I don't appreciate how hard he tries, and I only focus on the bad things etc. But the truth is I'm just tired of being disappointed and upset. I don't want to be angry every single Monday afternoon. So this is my solutionSo...AITA?Edited to add- I don't care HOW he does it or when. All loads are already sorted out. He could do a load every other day all week and then I just put them all away on Monday. IDGAF how it gets done. But if he wants ME to fold/sort/put away all the laundry, I just ask it be ready on Monday afternoon because it's the only free afternoon I have all week.

My brother is a high-functioning autistic and germ-phobic. Every single night he does his routine at around 10pm, which includes opening my door no matter what I’m doing, and telling me he’s going to bed and to keep my door shut and be quiet. I always say yes, but the problem is, we have a cat who can open doors. Our doors are French doors too, and don’t have that little latch thing that most doors have, so they can even swing open in the wind.So, last night, I got home after a late night at school working on a project and wanted to play video games with my friends. Ten minutes later, my brother barges in and tells me to be quiet. I protest to our parents, but they tell me to just play my games silently. So, I do just that, and inevitably, the cat strolls in and opens my door, and I don’t notice. Soon enough, though, my brother screams from his room to shut my door because the lights from my room are in his room. He keeps his door cracked open, because it’s not on quite right and the cat will bang on it if it’s closed until someone opens it for him or he gets bored.My brother does this every single night, and since I’d had a long day I just ignored him. A minute later he yelled again, this time angrier. This goes on for five or so minutes until I scream back to shut his own door or just roll over (his bed isn’t right in front of his door, it’s around a corner, and he could easily ignore the sliver of light just by rolling over). Eventually, he stomps into the hallway, grabs my door handles, and repeatedly slams my doors open and shut over and over again until my parents come upstairs to yell at him. I’m just glaring at him at this point because I really don’t care that he’s angry for the hundredth time over something so petty. Meanwhile he’s shaking in rage. My parents tell him to just shut his own door and he does that, but not before calling me various names.I told my parents later that I thought this was getting a bit extreme, because I can’t turn around constantly and stare at the door to make sure my cat hasn’t opened it, and i already put up with a lot from my brother (he leaves a mess all over the countertop of the sink whenever he’s done using it, he never puts his dishes in the dishwasher, he yells at my partner whenever I have them over because he doesn’t like us talking and says we’re too loud in the middle of the afternoon, stuff like that). My parents say they’re working on it but all his issues just keep getting worse, and from what I’ve heard about his therapist, he seems to be an enabler.Because he has so many issues of his own and I could have just gotten up and shut the door, and I was partially influenced by my tiring day, I might be the asshole, but I still think that everything I have to deal with from him is ridiculous, and I’m so tired of it I just can’t wait to go away for college. That day was just my breaking point. AITA?EDIT: I talked with my parents, and brought up a few popular ideas among the comments: getting a blackout curtain for his door, and potentially also a noise machine. My mom shrugged it off and said that adding more things to “specialize” his room and allow him to “further isolate” would not prepare him well for his future, and me dealing with a tough living situation is something I should get used to with college on the horizon. My dad was a bit more understanding, and eventually I convinced him to talk to my brother after he gets back from the gym on Wednesday (my brother goes every other day).My mom is still adamant that my brother believes that he is being very accommodating to me just as I am being accommodating to him but the fact is, he doesn’t do anything for me. She also thinks that this situation with him not having a “specialized room” (aka a room that doesn’t help him with his needs at all, save for the largest bottle of hand sanitizer in existence) and me having to deal with the entire upstairs revolving around him is beneficial for both of us, and will teach us good coping skills our futures. Personally, I don’t believe slamming your siblings doors over and over again is a good coping skill, but you do you mom.Now it’s just down to playing the waiting game for a few days and seeing what comes of my dad and brother’s talk, if anything. I’ll keep y’all posted, and thank you so much for the feedback. Without you, I probably wouldn’t have done anything about this, because I didn’t realize how bad of a situation this was.",

	"title" : "AITA for being upset that my friends won't share their shifts with me?",
	"body" : "I have been travelling Australia & have made some friends along the way. I'm from the UK. 2 of them got a job in picking fruit & decided to move to a small town. I also got this job & decided to go with them. On the way, we met with one of the girls' friends from home & she decided to also join us & was the last to get the job. As there was 4 of us, there was no longer room in the car so I had to fly & I got there 5 days earlier.When I got there, my boss said that the fruit season hadn't started & so put me onto other work in the meantime, like working in a club & petrol station. I was ok with this as I believed it to be a temporary situation. The latter job is the worst I have ever had, with a micromanaging manger who has made rather inappropriate advances towards me which have left me feeling very uncomfortable, meaning that I really don't want to work there & this isn't just a normal petrol station job.When the girls arrived the season still hadn't started so I was still working the odd jobs & they were going to be started there as well. One Friday, however, my manager started them on some other fruit and then they were started that Monday on the main fruit we had come to pick. I already had to do the work in the club as I had made that commitment as I had been rostered, so I couldn't join them, & I assumed that I would be started with them on the Monday.On the weekend, another guy  who applied and arrived after me got put onto the farm work, despite my insistence to the manager that I wanted to work on the farm.Monday rolls around & I haven't been put on that farm work, instead doing very few and short shifts at the petrol station & barely clocking 20hrs a week total between that & the club. Now it's been almost 2 weeks & the girls have been working non stop (yes 7 days a week) & despite begging, I have not been put onto work the farm because my manager says I don't need my farm days to renew my visa as I'm from the UK. They've been told that they'll have 3 more weeks of picking ahead of them.Now AITA for being upset with them for not sharing their shifts with me? We got into an argument and my case for this was that we all left the big city in order to go up together & work on the farm, & now that we've come up here and they've got work, they no longer care about that camaraderie as they've got it good. I applied and got the job before one of the girls and the guy who moved in that weekend & yet I still didn't get work which to me is incredibly unfair. I also came the earliest out of everyone and showed initiative for taking any shift, anywhere that I could and feel punished for it.These girls are getting 7 days a week, 8 hour shifts while I'm struggling to cross the 20hr barrier. To me it would seem fair to rotate who takes a day off, that way 3 of us get 5 days a week and one 6 days and we'd all have enough to live on. I no longer want to remain friends as I feel really rejected and not cared about in this situation.",

He is a cash buyer, paying for the house in full using parents money, with no mortgage obligation. In a conversation we were having this weekend, he said that we wanted me to feel as though it was my house too, something that we were doing together, and feel as though I was able to contribute; I replied that of course I was very happy to contribute to the fair share of the bills, and that it would be great to start our life together.At this point, he said he was worried that I had misunderstood, and felt that he should be clear. He then suggested that he wants me to cover his share of the bills, and not just contribute my portion, in place of a 'rent' for living there, and so that he has to incur close-to-zero outgoings himself. I questioned why we couldn't just enter the house as equals, paying an equal share of the costs incurred as a result of living there: asking why I should 'pay his way,' and stated that I was uncomfortable in the power imbalance this would create, and that I would feel like I was 'renting off my boyfriend' and that he was trying to 'make money from me.'He questioned why his parents money should cover the cost of my \"rent,\" and claimed that I would be saving a great deal more money than if I was living in private rented accommodation (as I am now), which although is true, doesn't feel like a particularly nice position to be in, because as far as I see it, there isn't any \"rent\" to pay?

As far as I’m aware, this is from a hookup that she no longer has access to and was from a consensual encounter.She came to me on Sunday, cried about the results and while I responded with sympathy, my reaction wasn’t severe. I asked if she still had valid insurance and she said yes, so I said she’d be fine and that the worst of it is over then.She called me heartless and said I had no idea how ruined her life is. I kind of shrugged at her and said she just needed to adhere to treatment and she’d be fine. Again, this set her off and she called me an evil bitch because I didn’t see how awful her life was about to be. And I admit, I may have been crass and said “I don’t see how a mildly steep copay is going to kill you?”. She was very angry with me and left me to sit on the interaction. My mom and dad are upset that I wasn’t as sympathetic with her because she truly does feel as though her life is over and at the end of the day, it’s still a big deal. AITA for how I responded?Edit: I don’t blame my sister AT ALL, for her diagnosis. No one should expect to get a disease from a single encounter and I don’t think it’s earned or justified by any means.I LOVE my sister. She is my only sibling and I helped raise her, and while this situation isn’t perfect or ideal I still love her very much.And my response was based in logic, it didn’t come from a place of hatred or resentment. I just thought logic would help.Please stop asking if I am autistic, that’s really not relevant.200 comments and 2 hours later, I already see where things are going.I love my sister to death, and I’d do anything for her. And she needed me to be her rock and I was a little too solid and literal with her.I called her and explained my side and even linked the post to her, we cried over FaceTime and I told her I was so very sorry for making her feel like she didn’t have any support.I’ll be accompanying her to her  follow up next week. She needs to know she’s loved and cared for right now so that’s what I’ll do for her.And for the strange amount of you who are asking if I am on the spectrum or assumed it and to the one person who sent me a test, yes I am.Post mortem - My final thoughtsMy sister has read your comments, and she appreciates the kindness. She is feeling better, we have been helping her figure out her next steps. In this case and in our state, the state health department is going to help her press charges because after contacting the person she was involved with, they were aware of the situation and proceeded anyhow.To the comments that asked about symptoms or how she knew; fatigue, long lasting flu symptoms and swollen lymph nodes. But you should always get checked, know your status. Not only to protect yourself but to protect others. And if possible, start PREP.To those of you who feel as if HIV is a deserved punishment, I honestly hope you can be perfect all of the time and never have any lapses in judgement. I hope you can tell when people are lying or being dishonest and be that much better than the rest of us.I have a weird amount of Vulcan and robot comments and I’d like to laugh?

My toys are the pride of my childhood.My family house (owned by father) was rented out by my uncle which is okay for me as I live overseas and I am sincerely happy someone is residing currently and looking after the property. Issue being he did not provide notice and moved my belongings without my input. EDIT To clarify the living situation, the house is partitioned into 3 spaces within the one building, my grandma living in one, my uncle in another, and myself and mum living in the last before we moved out, and the whole house including the 3 spaces is owned by my dad. My uncle had no authority to rent out my place and if he did so at least he should have done a proper job respecting my items. Mind you I am not getting a single penny for my house being rented out. The rental happened in secret and I could no longer return to gather my stuff as I was waiting for citizenship. Property belongs to my father and he did not consent to the rental at all. We all considered our family home as our safe place left unattended we would eventually return to.Issue being.. my uncle left my childhood toys in the rented out family house with strangers. As a result my toys were lost overtime. His excuse ? Not enough room. I told him if one wants to make room they can. My family are hoarders they have so much trash. I said if it was your stuff you would go above and beyond to keep them safe.People who transferred my stuff  are my mother and uncle. At that time I was overseas and was not allowed to go back home for bureaucratic reasons. My mother assured me she did not throw anything out and could not enter our family house as strangers were residing at that time and did not want to disturb them. My uncle admitted he left my stuff under my old bed and asked the tenants if the stuff bother them. They said no. But since then many tenants have changed.I was heartbroken and kept crying hysterically looking through storage rooms, under some stairs and a seperate room. It did hurt me that my stuff were not in a single place but rather scattered here and there. I felt like I was tirelessly collecting my pieces trying to reclaim control and keep my cool at the same time.I was relieving past trauma as years ago my step mother tore apart childhood photos which included my mom. I wasn’t present at that time. I found out when I last visited my family house. All my photos and even baptism pictures were placed in a little hole at the back of the house. It’s not an attic. (It’s legit just a hole at the back of the house that’s far far up. I had to climb there like a cat). That’s really bad as the moisture can severely damage my belongings. That happened years ago and again I was tirelessly collecting my pieces together. The hole where the pictures were placed is not safe at all to reach as one can easily fall and break their bones. I felt excluded from my own family. My dad did nothing to stop this. He has poor boundaries and wants to please the new wife.This happened ages ago with my pictures  and now my toys..It is not easy to travel to my family house as I literally have to travel 20 hours. Last time I visited the house was not rented out yet and my childhood toys were still under my bed. I wish I made room to take them with me at that time.So AITA for trying to negotiate with my uncle to pay for my lost toys?",

He has a good voice, but he is very self conscious about it. Apparently, in high school he was singing during youth group one day and a girl leaned over to him and said, \"If you aren't going to try to sing then don't sing at all.\" He says since then he doesn't like letting most people hear him sing as he feels he doesn't have a good voice.I've tried convincing him to come with us for months now and that his singing voice is good and that what that girl said was cruel but he has to try to move on. I promised he didn't have to sing and he could instead just watch and enjoy our company. Saturday he agreed to come.We were all taking turns and singing and having fun. Friends would ask him what he was going to sing and he kept saying that \"Karaoke isn't his thing.\" As the night went on and drinks were flowing I guess people kept asking him to try and he was starting to consider it. He gave me a look like he wanted my opinion on it and I said, \"I won't make you sing but it may good for you to try.\" The whole group agreed so he went and selected his song.I don't know if it was the nerves, song, or the alcohol but he admittedly wasn't very good. Was off key even for Karaoke and he wasn't great with the timing. He's usually better. However, when it ended I still gave him a big cheer and my friends cheered too. The rest of the place was pretty silent minus a few claps here and there. He sits down and is friendly with everyone for a minute then he tells me he wants to go home. I asked if we could stay just a bit longer. He said that I could and went and ordered an Uber for himself. He left telling everyone he was feeling tired.When I got home he went ballistic on me saying that I pressured him to sing and that it was extremely embarrassing for him seeing my friends pity clap him and the rest of the place just silent and awkward. I don't believe I pressured him but he said that not shutting down my friends requesting him to sing was endorsing it, which I understand but feel my friends weren't that insistent and that he was good. We cheered him afterwards and we gave a bunch of compliments. I can't control how he is feeling about others and while they maybe shouldn't have kept asking, he is fully capable of refusing their requests. He slept on the couch that night and the past few days hasn't wanted to hang out or really talk.I feel he's overreacting and making a bigger deal than it needs to be. My friends agree that he shouldn't be acting like this. They feel if he is this self conscious about this then he should take singing lessons instead of taking his insecurities out on me who was only trying to help and share a hobby of mine.  Maybe I should have said something or just shouldn't have invited him to Karaoke? AITA?",

	"body" : "I, (AFAB, 23) have repeatedly been asking my mother (F60) to clean her house, which I live in as well. There are piles and piles of clothes on our dining room table, the king sized bed, and our very large basement, attic and two car garage which you can barely walk through for all the stuff piled almost to the ceiling.We have no kitchen counter space due to all the clutter.  She is aware that she has hoarding tendencies, and has expressed a desire to go to therapy about it, but never followed through. My father (M65) has also expressed frustration with the living situation. Moving out is not an option due to my financial situation.I have offered a list of accommodations/modifications my mother could do for cleaning the house and she has not used any of them. I have tried to schedule days where we go through the piles of stuff, but she always has other things pop up or she “doesn’t feel well enough to do that today” due to her disabilities.  I am also disabled and work 45 hours a week.y father is also disabled and does what he can.The house is becoming unsustainable and unsafe to live in, which my mother has acknowledged verbally. There is mold and mice, as well as the tripping hazard from walking past and over the boxes of clothes and the loose clothes on the floor. I worry one of them is going to fall and break something and paramedics would be unable to get to them.No one is willing to assist us with cleaning the house unless we pay them, because it always ends up being covered in stuff again. Our relatives dislike visiting due to the clutter in the house.Am I the asshole for telling my mother to clean the house or I will throw away the things that are too soiled to wash and keep (or the clothes I had when I was 8) because she says she “needs to go through them before they get taken to goodwill because someone could use them or I might give away a family heirloom.”?",

She was being controlling and toxic. There was alot of mental and verbal abuse as time passed and she kept getting worse. She would constantly kick us out over small arguments. (who cleans more, taking jokes too seriously, amazon being charged to the wrong card.)We started looking into our own place because it was just starting to be too much for us. She brought up that she wasn’t going to have the surgery in November like she originally planned, so we kept looking for places. During Christmas, she brought up that she was going to go through with the surgery in February and is going to need our help. This wouldn’t have been a problem if she didn’t say during arguments that “she doesn’t need us” “she could take care of the bills on her own”.In the beginning of January we were given the opportunity to apply for an apartment thats move in ready and in our price range. After approval they can’t hold the apartment for long so we decided that if we get approved then we will be moving. We would have to move by March 1st. The best part about it is its in the same complex so we can still be near them to help out.My boyfriend told her about the opportunity and she went BALLISTIC. Keep in mind we haven’t gotten approved. She was saying things like “If you guys move don’t ever talk to me again” “You guys are just using me” “You're ungrateful”. She even threatened to kick us out that very same night after we told her. She had the nerve to throw and break her phone and call us childish.We don’t want to pass up this opportunity but we don’t know if we should stay or not.

We manege to get her to her appointments by using the medical transport that fits a wheelchair and to get her down I usually manage cause I’m pretty strong (stuff easy go down) but I can’t pull her up the stairs (stuff pull up hard) I always need someone’s help.The people that usually help me with that at weren’t there so I asked my bf.My bf (23) is the best, I’ve complained about how the family don’t wanna help with my nana’s care cause they’re busy and he always offered to come and help me.This time I took his words and a day before ask him if he could, he said yes and seemed happy about it. Today, it’s raining bad, I didn’t really know how bad until a couple hours before to which I was debating canceling the appointment but it seemed so near i went with it, bf said no comment about the rain until I said it was pretty bad (texting) he agreed and said how bad it was to go to the gym. I said I’ll see if there was maybe something I could do,  cause I really didn’t want him to drive.I cant cancel the transportation is here, I don’t text him for a while and he goes “figure something out?” I just didn’t reply cause I was stressing with getting my nana not frustrated and then I see a text of him just saying “baby I don’t think I’ll be able to go… it’s flooded and closed off… and a lot of stuff of how he didn’t want to drive” and I went “it’s fine (it’s not idk what to do) I’ll figure something out” he says he feels like he’s disappointing me and asks if I’m mad, I say it’s fine.My problem is he’s done this to me before, cancel on me, it stopped once we became official or still felt like that same way.

EDIT: I’m still in pain and discomfort at this point, and I didn’t think I had to specify that I’d like a partner who can be sensitive to that. So obviously part of the recovery process is not being able to eat or chew for a couple days and only eating foods like soups, smoothies, applesauce etc. I also can’t eat anything extremely hard/things that will get stuck in my teeth like popcorn for over 6 weeks. A little background about me: I’m a popcorn girly. It’s literally my favorite snack to eat and I practically eat it every night as a treat to myself and to decompress from the day. Anyway, my boyfriend (20 m) has been coming over to keep me company during the recovery, and today he showed up saying he was really hungry, and brought a steak to cook at his friend’s house that he was planning to go to after. Now mind you, I woke up today starting to get really hungry and feel the effects of not having eaten a real meal since Thursday. However, I know how important it is for my bf to eat and he doesn’t always do the best job of feeding himself, so I gave him the okay to make the steak at my house since I could tell he was hungry and hadn’t eaten anything all day. I tried to distract myself from the smell with eating ice cream and lighting a candle as well as opening the window. Anyway, it was fine and he ended up leaving to his friend’s house and coming back a few hours later. Now, when he came back he complained about being hungry again even after having eaten the steak from earlier, and apparently some chicken nuggets at his friends house. He began to look around in the kitchen for anything he could eat and found some popcorn and I could tell he wanted to make it. I said “nooo” begrudgingly as I obviously didn’t want him to make the popcorn and eat it in front of me when it’s something he knows I won’t be able to have for over six weeks. I offered to order him food instead, but he didn’t seem to like that option. He then got upset at the fact that I was upset and later made the popcorn anyway. I know it’s silly, and that the steak was probably worse in principle , but the popcorn just drove me over the edge. The smell was so strong and my stomach was rumbling horribly. I then became silent as I knew explaining to him wouldn’t do any good and he clearly had his mind set on making the popcorn, which is how he is in another situations when he already has his mind set on an outcome. When we talked about it after, he argued with me by saying he was hungry and the popcorn was all he wanted to eat. AITA??? I’m almost certain I’m not.",

And it became this whole argument and him saying that if I press him then it doesn’t help, but I’ve also tried a avenue where I’m not pressing him, and it doesn’t help so it’s a lose/lose situation for me I feel like. We got into this huge argument, and I just want to know if I’m the asshole because I clean up 90% of the house, I clean the kitchen, I clean the living room, and I clean his own bedroom, so why whenever I ask him to do little things on his own it’s an issue.? am I the asshole?Sorry if hard to read, used Siri .",

About a month and a half into the split I decided I needed to get rid of everything he gave me or that reminded me of him which included loads of pictures (however he has copies of most of not all of them), some clothes (hoodies and t-shirts mostly) and heartbreakingly my stuffed whale. I didn’t want to just throw it out so I took it to a local kids group home.I had a really bad health scare a few months ago and my mom reached out to him. He visited me in the hospital and reconciled and got back together and are currently in couples therapy.A week ago he asked where she was and when I explained I donated her he got really upset. She meant a lot to both of us, and it really hurt me to give her up. But he’s been a bit distant and cold ever since. And I can’t help feeling like I really messed up our second chance and should have just hid her away in my closet.So AITA?TLDR: I donated my stuffed whale after my BF and I broke up, now that we’re back together I feel terrible.",

I give my presents before they go.Last year my BIL got married very quickly to a much older woman (40). I’m not someone who meddles in others relationships but I am very protective over him. He is a very vulnerable and very easily manipulated person. He has never been in a relationship before. He has been rejected and bullied severely throughout school and even though uni.My husband and I don’t like his wife at all. When they were dating (6 months) he wasn’t allowed to go anywhere without her. We thought this was very concerning so we had a talk with him.After they got married it got really bad. She quit her job making him the sole provider makes him do all the housework and cooking will throw things at him if he doesn’t do anything to her liking.We saw him at new years and it was honestly so scary because the amount of weight and hair he had lost is insane.My MIL birthday hike is coming up so she very begrudgingly invited her as well.

My MIL called me and asked if she should just comply so BIL would still come and feel connected.

My grandma died when I was 15 and we have had family issues since. Five years ago,we used to yell and scream and argue with each other a lot and had to her family counselling,one of those points being to talk more. I am a bit known as an introvert and antisocial and yet for four years now,I’ve been the only one putting in effort to talk to him. Everytime I talk with him I get a generic “oh right” response everytime. I’ve expressed how when he only responds with that,it sounds like he doesn’t care and he still says it so I feel like it’s on purpose. He is also a bit narcissistic where if he does something wrong,he never owns up to it and seems to blame me or someone else. Even around his friend’s cat,he talks more to them than me. I know I sound whiny but when a grandfather is making his granddaughter feel inferior to a cat, it’s a bad sign. I just feel frustrated and hurt and don’t feel the effort to talk anymore when I’m clearly the only one trying..it’s like he doesn’t know he’s hurting me,even know he knows how exactly he’s hurting me.

M was previously a DM for the first few months during the year, and wasnt very good at it. She played favorites, changed rules constantly, her campaign was a Carbon copy of a dnd podcast, and didnt let us do much if it didnt have anything to do with what she wanted. For example, the dr1nking age at the beginning was 16. Then it was raised to 22 just two sessions later, and my character is the oldest, at 21. Another instance, we were in the forest, about to go on a quest because one of the party members wanted a pet dragon, and we all agreed to do it, but M decided she wanted to do a beach day instead, even though she promised we would do the dragon quest. Anyway, one day she wasn't here, and I was allowed the opportunity to DM, since by the time we were all informed that she wasn't coming, our busses had already left, and those who got rides home every day wouldn't be able to leave until 3. Everyone in the party decided that they enjoyed mine more. So, we've been doing mine. The next week, M tells me we're going to be alternating weeks. She doesn't ask, or suggest it, she states it as if it's a fact. I begin the session, and she immediately starts trying to take control of it, adding rules, changing things, interrupting while I or a party member was speaking, and refusing to follow any rules. I told her over message that we weren't going to be alternating, and she seemed fine with it, but she texts me weekly that she wants to run a session, and I tell her in the nicest way possible that I don't want to alternate, and that none of the party members want that either. Yet she continues to push. I eventually told her exactly why I wasn't alternating(because I didn't want to and the party members don't even LIKE her) and now she's being very rude towards me and called me Miss-Know-it-all for 'putting words in everyone's mouths' and that if everyone has a problem with her, then they can tell her themselves. Everyone in the party is on my side, but M is calling me the asshole. So, am I the asshole?",

Important to notate that I also speak with the 12 year old. We get along well.Lately since they 12 year old has been having bits of mood changes and  his relationship with his parents has been rocky specially with my husband so I thought that seeing my husband do something nice for the 12 year mom would lighten up the 12 year old mood. Well to my surprise the mom casually mentioned at the table how my husband tells her “love you ” sometimes time when they speak. I had no idea this was going on because it has never been done in front of me. My husband immediately said oh I said that to my best friend, my boss bla bla trying to brush it away.

Many sexual jokes were said after that. Mind you she is single and has been single for the last year.Here is the dilema. My husband was served yesterday with a child support and custody battle for the 8 year old. He was feeling anxious about it because he is afraid that he is going to get to see his son less. He loves his kids. That happened in the morning. We prayed, we call a lawyer, I did research online I feel like I did everything I could about that.Last night we spoke I told him how uncomfortable that made me feel. How I feel like is unacceptable for Him to tell her “love you” , that I had no idea this was going on he said that he understood and that he was not going to continue to say it but he never said in any romantic way. . I said ok but that I still was upset about it. I woke up still feeling upset about it and told him I needed some time and space.Now he is upset at me because I brought it up last night and this morning.

A few things - my partner and I both work in healthcare with roles that are paid similarly so no sugar daddy situation here. He is also extremely stoic in his every day life so my reaction is even worse when taking into account that he doesn't often express his joy/excitement. I left out a lot of other information/background because it really doesn't matter. Ultimately, I should have shared in his joy and then waited to see if my help was needed/wanted. I reached out to my stepdaughter and in full transparency told her about my initial reaction and we had a great conversation about it. She has forgiven me. I have also apologized to my partner who has also forgiven me. I will take what I have learned and apply it to not be such an asshole in the future. Thanks for all of the replies!",

Anna had a few gap years before starting a Bachelor of Science majoring in Physics. She has just finished her second year.Whilst we were drinking at her boyfriend (Marks) NYE party, she mentioned how lucky I am to be studying a DVM because I get to hang out with kittens and puppies. I told her I'm very grateful to be studying this but it is a lot of work and the academic workload is a lot on top of placement as well.She jokingly said, \"well at least its not quantum physics!\" I laughed and told her I'd like to see her elbow deep in a cow's ass.She almost immediately changed tone and said \"I wish my studies were that easy, I've got books upon books of equations to complete.\" She then went on to say how she'd wanted to be a vet when she was a child and how she should have chosen it since its a lot easier than her current degree. She raved for a bit about how hard she studies and how easy it must be for me to slack off and spend time prancing around on a farm for credits.I told her I was just joking around and that vet school is actually quite intense, in fact its very difficult to get into. I explained its why I completed an undergrad degree first, and that I think a lot of people really underestimate how difficult it is, despite being a medical doctorate.Anna snapped back and said \"well I got into physics school, so it shouldn't be that difficult.\"I told her to get f*cked and got up and left. Spent new years with my family instead. Vet school has been really hard for me and hearing her be so dismissive set me off, especially because I've never heard anyone say \"physics school\" before. She just seemed really intent on saying how much worse she has it. I ended up forgetting about it but 3 or 4 days later, Mark (Anna's bf, party host) sent me a message asking me to apologize to Anna.

I have a group of 6 close friends (all 14/15 year old girls) who all range from regular middle class to very wealthy. We occasionally have sleepovers at each other's houses, and I'm the only one who's yet to host one. Here's the thing: I live in a council house (basically a house we don't have to pay for) in a very lower class neighbourhood full of crime, burglaries, robberies, fights, etc. My friends know that I'm poor but they'd never treated me differently for it until now.We planned to stay at my place for the weekend, and we went straight to my home after school. On the way, one of my friends kept making remarks about how \"intimidating\" the people were in my area and the others just agreed, including calling this homeless man who came up to us asking for money \"creepy\" and \"perverted\". This group of teenagers started randomly harassing and yelling stuff at us, trying to start an argument, and when they left my friends called them \"trashy\" and \"chavs\" (a derogatory term for lower class people). Previously I'd opened up to them about how hard it was to live here and how our house had been vandalised before and how we had to hide valuables incase of a break-in. I live in a small two bedroom flat on the first floor. My bedroom is only a box room that's small enough for my bed to fit exactly at one end, I sleep on a mattress on the floor, and the only other furniture I had was a box for storage and when my friends saw this they kept giving fake, sarcastic compliments about how \"cozy\" and \"tiny\" it was.After about an hour, one of my friends called her parents to pick her up and made some excuse about how she suddenly remembered that she had a family thing planned, which I initially believed. Then, soon after, another friend also said she had to leave as she was feeling sick. At this point I got suspicious and they eventually revealed that they felt \"unsafe\" staying over in my neighbourhood and wanted to leave. One friend said my house felt dangerous since my mum was working a shift that afternoon and wouldn't come home until midnight, and my friend was scared someone might break in, which was so irrational because I'd lived here my whole life and I was fine. She was the richest of us and lived in a huge house and had no idea what it's like to not be privileged. She had an awful experience in a poor neighbourhood a few years ago so I get what she was feeling, but we were literally staying inside so there's no reason for her to overreact.I told her she was being overdramatic, yet the rest and my friends all agreed with her saying she was justified in feeling unsafe. I couldn't stand how they made me feel alienated for being poor and how they couldn't even walk in my shoes for one weekend. In the heat of the moment I said my friends were all spoiled brats, and we ended up in a huge argument and they ended up cancelling the sleepover. AITA?",

In our divorce I didn’t fight for anything as I just wanted our daughter to see how a healthy relationship should be between her father and I not once argued Infront of her.We divorce when she was just 2 years old since the day we both separated she understood as I always told her she appropriate information for her to understand. My ex husband and I had agreed that when she was 8 we will speak about the reason why our divorced happed which obviously that didn’t happen. Our daughter understands what it is to have two homes. And have our significant other in her life and what they represent which she has great relationships with them. I have done everything in my power for this not to affect our child. She understands it was not due to her and that we both love her so much what she is wondering as to why I don’t speak about the conversation is due to my ex saying that he tried to fix our marriage but I didn’t want to and that I left and took her with me. And blamed my current partner as to why mommy and daddy can’t no longer get back together as we have a child. Which I have the right to restart my life but in his eyes I do not have that right. Everything was calm in our divorce until I got married and had another child and which triggered him and started to tell our daughter information that we both discuss as of when it should of been said to her.My partner and I have both agreed that if he doesn’t want to take counseling we will be putting our daughter through it as I do want her to her that it has never been because of her but life took us in different path. She doesn’t hold any hate towards our newborn in the other hand she loves her and is a great big sister. She just feels that I need to be more open to her in certain conversations which I agree but to a certain limit. He father will always be her father but I just want him to understand certain things should involved our child as she is too young. Will be contacting my lawyer in regards to the proper steps I have to take to not allow this to happen once again. As I have done everything in my end to make him understand but doesn’t seem to be enough. I can’t dwell in what if he decides not to do anything until he is ready as this is not about him our I but about our child and what benefits her the most.But once again thank you for all the comments and advice that everyone has given me I do appreciate it.",

For example, she yelled at me for licking excess pizza grease off my finger tips at a bar, and is always complaining that I have eye snot in my eyes in the morning and to remove it immediately. As we were getting ready to go for dinner on night one, I noticed she had a long singular black hair coming out of her nose. I asked if she wanted me to pluck it for her and she started screaming at me to mind my own business. Everytime I look at her now, I cannot focus on anything but the nose hair. It might sound childish but I can’t help but to focus on it. Because she’s been so judgy of me lately and my appearance, I don’t know why she wouldn’t want to quickly fix her own. I’d note that other than this weird nuance I’ve been a very supportive and helpful husband during the pregnancy which she acknowledges. So AITA or should she pluck the hair?",

	"body" : "Throwaway account, typed on mobile, etc. etc.My(33M) girlfriend's (32F) Uncle has 2 cats and 1 dog. TLDR, their care has always been marginal at best. Unclean conditions, not seeing a vet, unsocialized (even kept apart from each other) etc. Due to health issues the Uncle has moved into an apartment for his care and the animals remained in his house with neighbors/family friends checking in on them occasionally. This has not worked out.We live  an hour away and while  in the area she checked on the pets and was taken aback by the conditions. We're both huge animal lovers (4 cats and 3 dogs ourselves) and she didn't feel like she could leave them like that. Adding to this, the cold our area is experiencing caused the temp in the house to be far too low. I was at work when she called to get my thoughts on what she should do. I recommended she contact local rescue and humane society type organizations. She alluded to maybe bringing them to our place and I said I didn't think that was a good idea, as we barely have space for the animals we have, setting up 3 other spots for these to have their own space just isn't feasible. I could tell this wasn't the response she was hoping for, she got very snippy with me and hung up without even saying goodbye.About 4 hours later she is texting me about something else and slips in \"sorry in advance, but I went ahead and brought the 2 cats to our house, one is in the office, one is in the downstairs bathroom. FYI the office cat may scratch\" (paraphrased). I was pretty annoyed at this point, having 2 rooms of the house now mostly inaccessible and extra litter boxes around etc., but what I was most upset about was how she went about doing it. Hanging up on me when she didn't like my answer and doing it anyway, not telling me until after it was done.Now the part where I might be the AH. After being told there were +2  cats in the house (hopefully temporarily, she said she would try to find them new homes ASAP) I was annoyed  and my replies for the rest of the night were very terse. I finished my shift, came home and basically went straight to bed. She tried to talk to me about it, but I was tired, had a headache and didn't feel up to having an argument. This morning she left 3 hours before I did and as I was getting ready for work she texted me asking me if I would mind feeding the cat in the bathroom. In this same convo she was asking me to reach out to an acquaintance who trains working dogs (think police k9) to see if he wants her uncle's  pitt-bull. I told her I didnt think that would be a good fit and I wasn't comfortable asking him, considering I haven't spoken to him in 8 months. I replied that I would mind and did not want to feed the cat. She replied with a very sarcastic \"thanks for the help.\" I feel like she took on this responsibility against my advice and wishes and I am justified in not helping with their care. I replied \"thanks for the sarcasm\". This was 3 hours ago and we haven't spoken since. AITA?",

My partner and I are quite opposites with a lot of things, he’s a night owl and I prefer an early night/morning, for example. He likes to cook and eat late, I prefer earlier. Because of some core differences, we’ve both compromised on several things each way.One small thing I’ve noticed is that he comments I am ‘messy’ on several things. One thing is that I prefer to cook a meal, eat it and then wash up after. He prefers to wash up as he goes along and thinks it’s ‘silly’ to do what I do. In the same vein, he always unpacks his clothes into hotel wardrobes, whereas I don’t. I find it a bit pointless unless it’s a long stay, and I worry I’ll lose stuff if I go putting it in unfamiliar places. Instead I just use my suitcase as a base and keep everything within that refined space. Depending on what the item is, I might fold it and I might not. During both of these things he always comments I am ‘messy’ and suggests his way of doing things, to which I often decline.Moving onto this weekend, we’re staying at his parents. He has an armchair in his bedroom which I use as my ‘clothes chair’. I lay items onto it, one over the back and both arms. He calls this ‘messy’ in jokey tone. He also then comments on my use of the bathroom. Conversely, I like to lay my products out of my washbag on a shelf, because I reach for them regularly. He also audibly comments that this is messy.It starts to grate on me because I’m not a messy person, but instead just have fundamentally different habits to him. It frustrates me because he can’t see that jsut because it’s different to him, doesn’t make his way ‘right’ and mine ‘wrong’.We didn’t argue, but we do have a bit of a heated debate. He says why didn’t I just use the chest of drawers - I say there’s no point because we’re here for 48 hours, also he never offered me the drawers, I assumed they’d be full of his things.Ultimately, getting called ‘messy’ several times makes me feel judged, and it also reminds me of my ex who was abusive and very criticalAITA the asshole for putting up a fight about such a small thing, should I just have conceded and done what he asked me to do?",

	"body" : "My wife(31) and I(33) have been part of an all women gym for a few years now, it features classes like Circuit, Aerobics, Yoga Pilates, Zumba, Spin Cycle and yes Pole Dancing. There’s child care provided at certain hours but some classes are after the care center closes.My (32f) gym buddy “Kat” wanted to take a pole dancing class but was too bashful to take it alone. She asked me to take a beginners class with her starting after the new year even though I’ve had some experience in the past. It is 6 weeks of 12 classes for $130 meeting at specific times. Our first two weeks of classes(2 classes a week) were mostly fine but Kat is really competitive and doesn’t like being the one that needs extra help at the gym however she was tolerating the investment.Classes are paid for on top of gym fees up front with no refunds even after missing a class.The incident happened in our fifth class. I had to bring my baby (7 months). Over the years I’ve seen women bring babies after hours at times so it wasn’t entirely abnormal, mine was in his carrier asleep along the wall for the beginning of class but he woke up toward the end and earned himself a lot of attention.One of the younger gals(Early 20s) was “uncomfortable being so dressed down in front of a boy” wearing cheeky spanks and a sports bra. I told her she could wear more if she wanted. She argued back “or you could take him home so he’s not over here oogling us” I laughed as I told her with sarcasm “you’re more likely to get ogled by me than my baby.”That shut her up.Later Kat said she was embarrassed by the scene and wished I hadn’t come with my son in the first place sliding in a jab “it’s not like you need the class anyway.” This hurt me because when I was 18 my dad cut me off financially ‘for being gay’ and I put my gymnast/dance background to use dancing exotically. She knows it.So it actually hurt me and fairly deeply.I asked why she would say that and she said she was “so embarrassed” she no longer wants to go to class with me. I asked her again, why she was so embarrassed and she stated I ‘came out’. I didn’t. Yes she already knew I was married to a woman and no she never had a problem with it.I told her I’m not going to stop going when it’s already been paid for.

I thought I could sell it online for more money however my close friend from back home is always complaining about how some tops don't go down to her size in stores and everything is usually too big so I called her and asked her if she wanted it and I would post it to her and she could send me the money since it was such a nice dress. She said yes and said thank you!!This brings me to the issue, when I stayed at her house while I was home for the holidays just passed, I left some workout clothes at her house by accident. She told me and I asked her to post them to me as I don't have many pairs of gym clothes (and they also double as pjs) and she said she would but it's been 3 weeks and finally this week she told me it was \"a lot of effort haha\" which kinda annoyed me since I would have done it for her.I decided to put the dress up online instead of waiting for her to send me money which she saw and asked if I was selling the dress. I said yes and told her she could buy it from me for the new price ($50). She asked why $50 instead of $15 and I said I'll get more money out of it and then immediately asked her if she had sent me my clothes yet.She didn't reply to my message for a few days, (we usually talk here and there every day over text) and still hasn't sent me my clothes. I heard from my boyfriend who is friends with her boyfriend that I had been \"kinda rude\" to her? My bf told me that her bf had called me an asshole for trying to sell the dress without telling her.

I have been pretty badly disabled for almost 2 years, but the doctors are finally figuring me out and I’m getting much better.When she got engaged, I waited and waited for her to make me a bridesmaid, but she never did. Then I got a Save the Date card in the mail.When I asked if I was in the wedding (which is July 2024) she said no, because I couldn’t really walk. I’d told her multiple times that physical therapy was going extremely well and my walking was steadily improving.We'd always talked about helping each other with wedding stuff and being bridesmaids or MOH's to each other since we've known each other basically, but she never involved me whatsoever.When I explained I still really wanted to be there for her on her day, she said I could be a bride's assistant, and basically run all of her errands on the day of the wedding. It didn't make sense to me that she thought I couldn't handle being a bridesmaid, but wanted to pencil me in as an assistant, which is about the same amount of work.I said I was okay with it and ruminated on it for a day before realizing it actually hurt a lot that she would even suggest that.When I told her it hurt me that she didn’t talk to me about not being in the wedding before sending me an invite with next to zero communication, she claimed it’s because we barely talked and never hung out anymore.We live about 1.5 hours away from each other and I can’t drive, but my boyfriend of 3 years has always been more than willing to drive me to her so we could spend time together, and she always had some excuse why we couldn’t and the conversation dropped. I’ve never even met her fiancé because of this, and the last time I saw her (like 2mos pre-engagement) he was sick, and I couldn’t risk seeing him.We’re both adults with lives and it’s normal for us not to talk like we did all the time when we were younger. She told me she picked her college roommate (who she’s complained about more than once to me) to be a bridesmaid instead of me.I’m not as hurt that she didn’t choose me as I am that she didn’t even talk to me about it or ask if I’d be able to do it. I’ve always had such open and honest communication with everyone around, and I thought she’d at least say “hey do you think you’ll be able to be in my wedding” or something to that effect.I guess I wanna know if I’m the AH for being upset that she didn’t even think of me in her plans or talk to me about my involvement after years of us talking about being in each others weddings.Edit: Many are thinking I’ve barely talked to her in six months, never see her, etc. but it’s not the truth. It’s simply the excuse she used. Obviously when we were closer in distance, we saw each other more often because duh. But she never gave any indication the last several times we’ve talked, or seen each other, that she was pulling away. We’re both adults, and it is extremely unrealistic for her to expect us to talk and hang out all the time. When I went to my last appointment in her city, she dropped everything to come see me and give me a hug after it was over. She texts me when she needs someone to talk to and she’s bored at work, etc. I could not have known she was pulling away because the last several times we’ve connected, everything was fine until a couple days ago.",

The residence of the seller was only a 15 min walk from my apartment so she agreed I could meet her there later that afternoon. When I arrived at the door she brought me the chair, she seemed really nice, we made the exchange and I was on my merry way.Like I said, my place was not far so I decided to walk the whole way with the chair upside down with the seat resting atop my head. Upon arrival, I put the chair down in front of my desk and sat in it. Something was off. The wheels wouldn’t move; the chair wouldn’t roll. I turned the chair over and examined it. There were no locks, like some chairs and tables with wheels have. I wiped each wheel down, greased them up but were still all jammed. It was obvious after a good look that not just one but three of the four wheels were busted.I do realize that I’m a fucking ninny nob for not checking the wheels on the damn chair before leaving her house and giving her the money. She was just a nice, little university student, I didn’t expect her to be a double-crosser. Nonetheless, I messaged her right away and was polite about it at first, basically saying that I’m sure it’s an honest mistake and I’ll be happy to come over again right now with the chair and get my money back. She flat out refused and assumed that I had broken the chair somehow on the walk over. Of course I tried to argue my side and explain to her everything in a civil manner, but she proceeded to refuse, saying that she’s moving to a new apartment and she can’t take the chair back, nor return the money.At this point it was no longer about the money, it was about the principle. This is when I took on a more obviously frustrated tone, but without being menacing. I asked her if she knew the chair was broken and accused her of intentionally ripping me off. She only replied with more accusations that I must have been the one to break the chair.The next thing I said was the only mean thing I said throughout the entire conversation, which was, “your parents must be proud of you.” (Not that bad if you ask me). Ok, I might have said, “This is bullshit” once, but for the most part I was being a cordial cupcake.She immediately blocked me and about 20 min later I received a message from one of her friends. They told me not to make any more attempts to contact her and to stop threatening her or else they would call the authorities and give them all my FB information. But where was the threat?

He’s diagnosed with insomnia and used to take some pretty heavy prescription pills. He now works 120 hours a pay period in a few different jobs and is gearing up to start his first semester of school to become an ambulance driver.I work nightshift and in order to not be exhausted at work I maintain a sleep schedule on days off where I sleep around 6:00am and wake up around 2:00pm. This has been fine so far. I usually keep myself up and entertained with my ps4; wearing my headphones to cause the least amount of noise.Carl has several little quirks that are a bit strange but usually not disruptive, such as leaving the door to his room wide open almost all the time, showing me or other roommates a bunch of memes on his phone whenever we are at home (even if we are busy) or choosing to sleep on the couch instead of in his room. Lately the latter has been disruptive to my routine.

We chose to move to separate places as we had differences with how we wanted to live. For example, he wanted me to babysit the kids for every night he worked.At first, he helped me move my things out with no problem and I would eventually come back to help with some of his stuff. Though coincidentally, a large WWE event took place the very next day and more moving was to be done. For context, me and a group of friends online usually always watch these wrestling events in a watch party online, in which I'm usually the one who hosts it as I pay the subscription.A few days before the move I made sure to tell him about this and he seemed a little annoyed but agreed to me using a laptop upstairs. We also agreed that I would help with moving anything super heavy if they needed it.But just as the show was close to finishing the main event match, my brother and some other family members who were there to help, came up and told me to come with them to help move the stuff off the trailer at the other house.I told them the show would be done in 10 minutes at most which was when my brother blew a fuse. He constantly yelled at me and threw my headphones across the room before eventually leaving without me.Since then we haven't really talked since but I'm not sure if I should apologise or notI can see where he's coming from, but am I the asshole for doing what I did to begin with?Edit/Update: For a little more context, my friends and I are super die hard wrestling fans and any of the results from the night would more than likely appear on our social media feed immediately after the show.

Along with our senior project, we also must create a postcard for one of our promotional items. So I had the great idea of drawing my batsona character I use as my online avatar in the baphomet pose. I titled the postcard as The Devil tarot card so it could tie into my senior project. I originally had the illustration drawn nude.For me as an art student, I didn’t see this as a problem. I had been in nude and life drawing classes for more than half of my time here at college so I was pretty much desensitized to this kind of art. So I thought this was okay with my kind of work. However just to be cautious in case, I had made a variation of the original piece. My variation had my batsona in a nun outfit. She still had a good amount of skin exposed, however some more sensitive areas were censored in this version.Before I continue, I am well aware that my mom is a religious person so I had an idea that she wouldn’t be too positive about it. Yet my mind couldn’t have prepared me for what she said next. I was courageous enough to show her the first clothed version of the art piece and she sorta liked it. But when I showed her the original one, she said that it was horrendous. I asked her what was wrong with it and she said just to look at it. Now I was sure she wasn’t going to be too much of a fan of the art but I think what made me really upset was that she never specified why she didn’t like it.She just called it horrendous and that was that. The real kicker is that I showed her some of my nude life drawing art pieces before and she was perfectly fine with them. I didn’t even have my character in a suggestive pose or anything like that. Then again I have been so desensitized to nude art, I just think of it as a way of expressing one’s own talent with art. This started my strike of not to show her any of my art until the senior show. I mean most of my tarot cards I have made have a lot of skin showing, so I wasn’t going to risk showing mom this work for a while.Now in present day, I had updated my postcard idea to having my batsona covering her breasts. I understand that even this pose could be provocative, but from looking at it so much I just don’t see it. I gathered some more courage and I showed it to her, hoping for her to maybe have a more positive attitude on it. She still responded with: oh…that…uh lovely… And then for her to stare at me. What’s the kicker is that I am also really proud of this work too. I spent a while on it and I have made sure it wasn’t pornographic or anything. I even checked with one of my professors and they said it is provocative but not pornographic. Which is good in my opinion.

Early on in the relationship we suffered a few blips. He is neurodivergent, this was a new thing to navigate as he hadn’t been in a super serious relationship before. He has seasonal depression, adhd and believes he has high functioning autism. He loves to debate and consequently argue. Last night we were watching a recommended show of his. I had just had a new iphone delivered and was finishing setting it up- organising my new homepage, whilst watching the programme. He doesn’t like when I’m on my phone when we’re watching one of his recommendations. I regularly  avoid doing this. He believes it takes away from the experience of watching movies and that I can’t do both. I somewhat agree, if I were to be scrolling on social media but in this instance I wasn’t. I was setting up my new homepage. He pauses the TV and says ‘are we watching this or what?’. I say ‘yes, I’m just organising my phone screen’. (Not super happy at his tone and abrasiveness though). After the show is done, I say ‘hey, I don’t want to argue but I don’t appreciate the way you spoke to me then’. He starts to tell me that it was ‘rude, distracting him from the show, and that if it was important we could just pause the show. He asks can I not watch something without being on my phone for an hour?’ I say, ‘I don’t want to argue about this, I gave you the opportunity not to be a dick and you’ve just became defensive with me.’ I walk away, not wanting to argue. He attempts to explain that what I was doing is rude, it takes away from what I’m showing him, I wouldn’t do the same in the cinema so why here?, if it’s important we can pause, if it’s not then I should stay off my phone. I tell him that I was enjoying the show, that it was a mindless task of organising my Home Screen and I was still watching it and enjoying it. He disagrees. I tell him that I don’t want to be policed in my own home watching tv after work, sometimes I’ll want to go on my phone. I could maybe understand his frustration if it was an organised date night- where he shows something he loves, we make an evening out of it. But it was just, ‘what do you want to watch?’ And ‘idk, you pick’ kind of situation. I really don’t want to feel like I can’t be on my phone when we watch tv, it makes me feel like I have to give it all my attention, which becomes more of a chore than a nice thing to do together. I do enjoy his recommendations, but I’m not willing to not go on my phone (the little times that I do) just to prevent a blown up argument. Am I being rude and disregarding his feelings?",

	"body" : "I (F21) am currently a senior in college. My parents have covered my full tuition and part of room and board (through a set allowance where I pay part of my room and board and they pay part of it) throughout college, which I am very grateful for because they have three children and they don’t want us to start out our lives with student debt. They did have the stipulation that I had to completely pay for a semester of college, including tuition, room, and board, which I completely understood because I knew it would teach me more about the value of education and money and I wanted to chip in to help cover my tuition.I have worked extremely hard to earn scholarships based on my leadership and academic achievements. I am an engineer involved in several leadership roles in several extracurricular organizations. This semester, which is my last semester, I am only taking 6 hours, so I am not a full-time student. Tuition costs thousands less for part-time students than it does for full-time students, and as a result, $700 worth of my scholarships got rebated to my bank account. My parents and I were previously not aware I would get this money back, and that tuition would be less as a part-time student, and so my parents already had thousands set aside for my tuition that they now get to spend elsewhere.My dad has access to my bank account and noticed I had a large amount added to it this morning. However, my parents have since demanded that I give them this money to “go back into the pot” to help pay for my siblings’ educations. I feel as though I have worked hard to earn this money, as scholarships aren’t free— you have to put in the work to get them, and I have put forward a lot of work in rounding myself out and applying for these scholarships. I am about to start out my next chapter of life and my parents are cutting me off as soon as I graduate in May. Having this extra money can help pay for phone bills, insurance, and other costs I will incur when I start becoming completely financially independent. I am also living with my parents post-grad for 6 months and they are charging me for utilities and groceries. I offered to put the rebated money towards that, but that was shut down.They then brought up my upcoming wedding in January 2025, and threatened to cut back how much money they have agreed to give my fiancé and I for that wedding by at least $5k if I do not give them this $700 because I need to make sacrifices, as they are doing right now to save money.In the midst of this, I have been told I am selfish and do not think outside of myself for wanting this money and that I am clearly not mature enough for this next phase of my life. I do not think it is right for my parents to make it seem as if I owe them this money, even though they have helped me greatly throughout my life. I’m conflicted, however, because they are making me out to be so selfish for having these thoughts. AITA?",

	"body" : "I went skiing on Saturday, along with a million of my closest friends. By mid day the mountain was crowded and there were lines at some of the lifts.There was a rope drop that day on a whole new bowl that day. The way it works at this resort/this bowl, it’s the back side. You can ski down, but you have to take the lift back up. There is no other option. Single lift, single line to get out.A friend and I take the run, get down to the bottom, and there is a good 20+ minute lift line extending up onto the run. Booooooo. But what are you gonna do? It’s a “the line is so long, may as well take off my snowboard completely” kind of line. The line was so long that people were throwing snowballs at every chair that wasn’t full.This lift ALSO has Hike Back terrain, that is CLEARLY not open, under the lift You can basically ski past the lift, and then hike back to the lift, but there are no lifts lower, it’s all hike back. And it is more then obvious that none of that terrain is open (it’s some of the last terrain they get open, it won’t be open for a while).I watch a guy and his 2 kids ski down past the line, to where the rope is up for the hike back terrain. Which is down towards the front of the line. Then I watch him proceed to side step up to the line and try to slide in. I told my friends “excuse me, I’ll be right back”.I walked over and asked him, relatively nicely, if he had noticed the giant line that we were all standing in. He completely ignores me like he can’t hear me talking directly in front of him. This is where I may have been the asshole: I then yelled at him “Hey asshole, you see the big fucking line we’ve been all standing in for the last 20 minutes, get back to the end of the fucking line”. There is some back and forth that ends with him telling me “just be cool man, Ive got my kids with me” at which time I told him “Then set a better fucking example for your kids and walk your stupid fucking ass back to the top of the fucking line NOW you fucking asshole”.The kids appear to be like 10/12 ish. They heard everything we said for sure, the rest of the line really did not (I asked if they had heard me when I got back in line).Dude picked up his shit and went to the back of the line, because I physically stood in front of him and prevented any forward progress/blocked him from integrating into the line.",

My sister has hated my mother since the age of 11, and always brings up how my mother is an alcoholic and is a smoker during arguments. This all started when my mom and my sister just got done bickering about how my mom was horrible at parenting us (which she really wasn’t, I had a wonderful childhood.) and she always chose alcohol over us. (Also not true) my mom began crying, which any mother would after being called a horrible parent, and my sister called her names, such as a lazy pig. Soon after this dinner was ready and I came to my sisters room and knocked on her door when I then said “sisters name, dinner is ready!” And she then replied with “I’m not hungry, leave me the f*** alone.” I went back into the kitchen and told my mother that she wasn’t hungry. She replied with “it’s not a debate, she is going to eat dinner. I’m not letting her starve.” I then knocked on the door again to which my sister opened her door, screamed in my face, and looked at me with the eyes of a deer in front of headlights. She collapsed to the floor and began to say over and over again “I can’t do it, I can’t do it, I can’t do it” it was obvious she was faking it. As someone who has had multiple panic attacks I knew she was faking it because she has faked other things before such as Tourette’s, Autism, and more serious illnesses. She was there, laying down on the floor of our hallway like a damn toddler. I was so done with the constant fighting that I straight up walked into my room, put on my headphones, and watched YouTube. Yes, you’re probably thinking I’m sick for leaving my sister in the hallway alone while she’s having a “panic attack” but by the way, she has had this behavior since the 1st grade.

I suggested that we should just pay the bill and leave. So we go back to our apartment and we haven't really talk since yesterday when this all occurred.

	"body" : "Hi!I have just found this group and can’t wait for responses as honestly, I cannot tell if I am in the wrong and know I am seeing it through my own lens.So, I am completely out of money right now. After rent, I have budgeted money for transport to job interviews and transport for if I get a job (praying it will be any day) and then I have £2 per day for food and no family for support at all and no money at all for anything other than food, like seriously, nada. I live with three other people and one of them has just gone away, but we have an agreement where if we leave, we still pay for the cleaner (I actually also don’t agree with this rule, but adding for extra context).We have all been away a lot so haven’t had the cleaner since before Christmas and now they mentioned starting it back up at the beginning of February and I asked if we could skip this one clean until mid February and do a cleaning rota and split the shared spaces (literally takes 15 mins each) and they have said no and that they want the cleaner. I then said how about I clean the house entirely (for free of course) instead of getting the cleaner, then two of the flatmates together suggested that they cover my section of the cleaning money for February but then I pay them back in March, but pay for the entire payment for the house, so I am essentially paying interest. So, it is £36 per clean, and they (the two flatmates) have said they will consecutively cover my £18 contribution for February, but then I pay £36 in March. So by the time I would pay my portion for that clean and repay the £18, then I would pay an extra £9.Honestly, I think it is ridiculous that I should have to pay interest for something when I actually have never wanted the cleaner anyway and have always paid to not make things awkward or difficult. I would get it if I said that I wasn’t going to deep clean the house, but I don’t understand why they won’t let me do that and instead are making me pay more for a luxury that I don’t want and physically cannot pay for. I will have got a job and been paid by then, but I am honestly so ridiculously deprived of like other ‘luxuries’ like not-reduced vegetables, or a haircut, dentist, new clothes to replace all my faded and unfit for interview/work clothes that I don’t think I’ll be able to afford to pay the ‘interest’ even in March as I have such a huge financial deficit right now :( £9 seems like so little but it is actually a lot to me right now.At a loss, as I have said no to the ‘interest’ but now feel like a dick. I have always been a pushover and recently have started to create boundaries but I think I honestly have trauma from so much previous and very genuine exploitation that it makes it impossible for me to get perspective in these situations as I think I have like a trauma response and think I’m under attack when I’m not lol.

	"title" : "AITA for not wanting to share my business’ info?",
	"body" : "I had a conversation with an old college associate of mine who is also an entrepreneur. For some background information - we were on a student group together in college, and he was running an event that I helped him with. I saw firsthand how he is an idea person, but that he struggles with his implementation. For example, he would text me almost every time he had to make a major decision.I was his “boss” in the student organization, so I worked with him to get him to execute his ideas  effectively. All in all, he never publicly thanked me for my contributions to helping him (he took the credit for the entire event), although I was a very critical part of the implementation. Anyway, I just brushed it off given that it was my job to help him at the time and that the success of the initiative made the entire group look good.Fast forward a couple of years, and I’m now an entrepreneur with three businesses. He sees my posts on LinkedIn, and frequents my profile as well (I see who has viewed my profile). He sends a message saying he’s a “fan” of my LinkedIn posts and wants to catch up. Before he reached out, I sent out a post about recruitment and openings for my ventures, which had a great response. I am a bit wary of people reaching out now that I have seen a bit of success, but I obliged.We finally sit on Zoom (we don’t live near each other), and he’s going off about his revenue (sharing the exact dollar amounts he made), success, and how he struggled to balance building two businesses. He does stop to ask me about what I am working on, but no direct compliments - just the vague “I see you doing your thing.” Then he starts asking me very direct questions about what revenue streams I have for each business, how I have been able to raise funds for my business (tries to inquire about the amount of funds) and he even asks me what value my business provides to my customers and says he wants to “challenge me” to state my value proposition for him on the spot.The whole conversation seemed a bit intrusive, especially since we haven’t spoken in almost 3 years. I gave him vague answers and refused to go into specifics, which he was taken aback by.Furthermore, he assumed that I didn’t know how to coordinate a community building mechanism digitally. When I told him I did and that we use Mighty Networks, he told me that the one he uses is “better” and then sends me a link to the community mechanism he uses. Then he said that there are “synergies” between our work, but didn’t mention any explicit type of intended collaboration. Additionally, he doesn’t support any of my ventures so I’m wondering why he wants to locate synergies all of a sudden.I am a female founder and I am wondering if this line of conversation is normal for someone who hasn’t spoken to you in about three years. Am I overthinking this or is he a bit competitive? I’m wondering if I should continue to keep in touch with him. Am I the asshole for not wanting to share those details about my business with him?",

	"body" : "I recently quit this band I was in because of a few reasons. One of the main reasons was one of the two co owners is a person I really dislike on a personal level and that he always devalued my input and work by ignoring me whenever I said anything in band practice or he'd start counting in while I was opening a chart or the like. He did a lot of things that were rubbish including not paying me to bring my car to an island and then taking a nap in his air conditioned car for 4 hours while I scorched in the afternoon sun before the gig.Another reason I quit was because I was physically injured by the band on the 3rd to last gig of the season and it was a huge struggle to play the last 2. I couldn't justify the good pay for being harmed by them.Anyway, after about 3 months of me leaving I get a message from this dude asking me to sell the sounds I made on my synths so that their new keyboard player would have an easier time. I checked and there are 220 unique sounds I made for their giant songbook that they'd call on the fly rather than writing a setlist.It probably took me something like 90 hours I. Total to make all of them because sometimes there are up to 8 different parts I was playing at different times in the tune or the sound itself needed a really specific envelope filter that took me over half an hour to get perfect.This guy offered me 200 dollars for all of the sounds including all the samples I made and I'm just left sitting there thinking \"fuck you.\" To myself. Devaluing my work again at the rate of 80 cents per track even though I could get 30 bucks each on a lot of them. 200 dollars is like one night out for me and it's insulting. I thought of not answering at all which is what I've done so far but I also want to do a bunch of other things like tell him what they are actually worth, cut a deal at around 1200 and then also puty whole keyboard with sounds up for sale on Facebook Marketplace because the industry my band played in is very competitive and I know someone in one of the other bands would love to have the sounds as an advantage over my old band.Am I the asshole or is he?",

Many people made fun of this due to the lead singer being “cringey”. However, this band used to be my passion. I used to talk about it a lot but found not a lot of my friends really listened. I feel I may have been a little annoying but my passion is music and I love how their songs are put together. My friend at the time used to make fun of me for this, along with other things they used to make fun of. Every time I would mention this band, or any band, they would immediately be horrible even if they enjoyed the music before I expressed that I liked them. As if everything I said they always had to disagree to create conflict.

My brother often gets expensive clothes from stores like Nike and Calvin Klein while I usually thrift or buy from stores that offer cheaper.He likes to brag about this infront of my friends.The one thing I have over him is the fact that I go to a better school than him which is his fault. I got into a private high school because I was a top student. They also have a middle school program however my brother didn’t get in due to his low grades and bad recommendations. He created a fuss and I almost lost my spot in the school because my dad said we should be loyal(basically what he said was if they don’t want all of us they don’t want any of us)he got into a similar school but his doesn’t offer IB.Moving on to what happened a few days ago, I asked my dad for a new phone because mine was getting slow, but my dad told me to wait a bit so he could afford to buy me the best one, I was fine with that. I was taking a nap and my brother kept turning on the lights in my room, I asked him nicely to please stop but he didn’t stop so we got into an argument. One thing led to another and he flung my phone across the room, causing it to break. That’s when my dad got angry so he gave me enough money to buy any phone I wanted and that he wanted to wait to buy 2 phones but after this he said that he didn’t need to anymore. I bought the iphone 15 plus because I did research and found that it was the best for me.Here’s where I might be the asshole, after a day my brother started sucking up to my dad and afterwards he told me “Your brother is my kid too so I’ll buy him whatever phone he wants as well” I reminded him of what my brother did to my previous phone and about the constant torment, after some back and forth I told him I would be fine if he buys my brother the same phone as me but he said my brother wants the Pro Max and that he also gave me the option to buy it, but I chose the Plus model instead. I said that my brother doesn’t even deserve the regular model and my father said that’s not my call to make as it’s not my money. I stormed off into my room and we haven’t talked since but my brother came into my room about an hour ago because now my dad is considering not buying him the Pro Max and I’m starting to think I might be the asshole so AITA?",

I have always honoured and respected my mother as a woman and obeyed her rules.I am not someone who cares much for makeup anyway so it did not come off as a big issue to me, as of recently, I had seen some posts online of people trying out makeup to resemble celebrities they like and I thought I would try to do a look similar to that of Gerard way from the band MCR.In my head this was not a huge deal as I was only at home and was careful with her makeup products, it was overall harmless and I used minimal amounts to avoid a struggle with removing it.Unfortunately for me I had been caught in the act and my mother was fuming with rage, I was grounded for 4 months and was shamed relentlessly for behaving in such an unholy way.As if this was not enough she proceeded to tell my father I was worshipping the DEVIL and straying from God by mimicking Satan loving men after I had shown her the MCR band members (she forced me to tell her what made me do this otherwise punishment would be worse).As of now I am constantly being monitored by my parents and I am writing this on a friend's device.Am I in the wrong?",

	"body" : "I (15m) have a semiformal dance coming up in February where we can 'invite' other people to it. I have a friend who we can call Venus (14nb) who is my absolute best friend. We've been through some drama together and known each other for two years now, and practically all the said drama has been about romantic relationships.Anyways, a new girl came to our school this year who we can call Emma (14f) and she instantly became close with Venus, and I also enjoy talking to her as a pretty close friend. They text every night and I get small glimpses of just how long their conversations are, so I could tell that they were pretty good friends.Yesterday, I'd just finished asking two other close friends to the dance and they said yes. Just as those two were walking away, Venus came up to me and whispered that they wanted to ask Emma to the dance.Here's the part I think I'm the AH. Emma was walking by right at that second, so I simply went up to her and asked if she was coming to the dance. Venus joined us fast. Emma said yes and I was satisfied, so I left them to go to our lunch period. A minute or so later, Venus joined me quietly and whispered that they got friendzoned.I’ve never had a romantic relationship. I don’t know if I’ve ever actually felt romantic love yet, if at all. Remember when I talked about the drama we went through with romantic relationships? They were all because of yet another friendzone with Venus and a different girl, who left school last year.After school, Venus attempted to reconcile with Emma, who would storm off whenever Venus approached. They really did try to get my advice, but as I said, I’m pretty useless when it comes to romance compared to other friends, but Venus is my best friend and I want to help them.Here’s another concerning thing.Venus texted me last night, they sent Emma an 826-word text apologising and saying that they didn’t want drama, and still wanted to be friends (the exact word count). I feel so bad. It was totally me that ruined that chance, by just going up to Emma and asking so nonchalantly.This morning, Venus instantly covered up the 800-word text with their hand when they opened it and requested us not to read it, but told us that Emma hadn’t read it yet either. I stayed silent during a conversation that Venus and the other two had discussing it, where the apology text was deleted.Emma's been whispering with other girls and they've been shooting Venus looks, I’m really worried because the previous time that romance drama came into my life, my last friend group fell apart. I'm typing this from home after school on Friday.I know I'm the AH, I’m also looking for advice. I want to make my best friend happy and stay friends with Emma. Venus isn’t even looking for anything other than platonic friends, now.tl;dr: I accidentally asked a girl to a dance without realising my best friend had a crush on her. she’s been avoiding the two of us and I need advice on what to do, or say to my friend.",

We met Molly first, but Thaiel really got into the group and I consider him as a close friend. He doesn't feel like \"my friend's boyfriend. It was just different, he's an alright dude) at one point, and me and my other friends decided to give them some space.  As we gave them space, we decided to go on outings by ourselves, where Kate's boyfriend was invited.I was starting to talk to my boyfriend at that point, and I was so excited to tell my friends about it! But Kate and his boyfriend Richard (24M), were kind of rude about it, and Richard started making comments like \"be careful, because men suck. and maybe he only wants you for you know what\" and I felt really bad because I never asked for advice, I just want to share how excited I was about Todd. He also said stuf like \"the love only lasts 4 months, don't get too comfortable\", which I replied with \"so you and Kate don't feel love anymore\" and explained it was diffrent.In another gathering, Kate started making comments about how much money her bf made, which made me feel uncomfortable (she said this because I told her that my bf bought a game on Steam, which i only thought it was kind of silly and fun, and she said \"how is he gonna spend money on that? blablablabla. my bf makes more money and doesn't spend it on dumb stuff\").Eventually we all had problems with Richard, and caused the group to fall apart because we told her that we were uncomfortable. We haven't seen him since we told her this.Now, some days before my graduation I invited my friends, including Kate. But she was ofended my boyfriend was coming and started saying like \"if you can bring your boyfriend why can't I?\", and I explained to her how I just wanted close friends to come, which she took as an offense, and she decided to not come.I want to keep in mind that I have known Kate for YEARS. We were friends long before she met this guy.Kate is also losing her whole personality because this guy literally told her that he is embarassed of the way she acted. She was always the kind of crazy friend who never gave a shit about what people thought of her, but she stopped acting like this when she started dating this dude. And even said to me that the reason why she couldn't come is \"she has a responsability because they share a bed and a relationship\".She left a groupchat we had to talk about this, without Molly and Thaiel, because she's pissed at us that \"we don't accept her boyfriend\". We are super sad to see her go, and I don't know if it's my fault.",

Dad left us 16 years ago, and Patricia was the second adult providing for the family.When I was born I was suffocated or something, and was labeled as developmentally disabled. No one in the family ever looked past that label. Felicia and Arianna always treated me like a joke and excluded me from everything.Whenever I was alone with either Felicia or Arianna, she'd basically bully me. Past 2009, whenever I told Mom what those two did to me, she would do the same thing to me.Mom only saw me as disabled and incapable of anything, and wouldn't even bother to raise me. I never had a chance to grow.My school closed down and Mom put me in an ABA institution afterwards. The staff there made me completely regress, but Mom assumed the disorder was why. I suffered a mental health crisis when I was 10, which got me in a hospital. Mom only blames the disorder, so the staff who abused me were allowed to continue. Mom also grounded me for making her miss a day of work because of my \"little attitude\".The big rule at the institution was to  Just Follow Directions™. If no one told me to do a thing, I should never do it until I'm told. If someone makes me uncomfortable, I still needed to just follow their directions. At home, I stopped asking Mom for basic necessities like soap and underwear. I quit showering and doing laundry as that was being a good kid, being out of the way. I eventually smelled horrible, which was blamed on the disorder. Also, when I finally had the courage to ask for new necessities again, Felicia and Arianna would find it so funny that some R Word scum would want something so mature that even they would use. Mom and Patricia found it funny as well, asking why I suddenly want to be so \"fancy\". I finally got back on track with hygiene when I was allowed to shop alone, as I was able to buy anything without judgment, and hide it after I bought it.From late 2018 to mid 2020, Mom treated me much worse than the usual. Much much worse. To this day it's really hard to talk about.In 2021, Mom crossed yet another line, one that I also refuse to write about. I was so offended by how the family treated me that I impulsively changed my whole name without publishing, but a slip-up revealed my name to Felicia and Arianna. They of course found it funny and were belittling towards me. They've treated me this way about my name basically forever.Now, Patricia has terminal cancer and is dying. If a new house is bought, it will be in Felicia's name. Felicia is extremely petty and will force me to comply with her as she owns the house. That's just how she is.

There’s child care provided at certain hours but some classes are after the care center closes.My (32f) gym buddy “Kat” wanted to take a pole dancing class but was too bashful to take it alone. She asked me to take a beginners class with her starting after the new year even though I’ve had some experience in the past. It is 6 weeks of 12 classes for $130 meeting at specific times. Our first two weeks of classes(2 classes a week) were mostly fine but Kat is really competitive and doesn’t like being the one that needs extra help at the gym however she was tolerating the investment.Classes are paid for on top of gym fees up front with no refunds even after missing a class.The incident happened in our fifth class. I had to bring my baby (7 months). Over the years I’ve seen women bring babies after hours at times so it wasn’t entirely abnormal, mine was in his carrier asleep along the wall for the beginning of class but he woke up toward the end and earned himself a lot of attention.One of the younger gals(Early 20s) was “uncomfortable being so dressed down in front of a boy” wearing cheeky spanks and a sports bra. I told her she could wear more if she wanted. She argued back “or you could take him home so he’s not over here oogling us” I laughed as I told her with sarcasm “you’re more likely to get ogled by me than my baby.”That shut her up.Later Kat said she was embarrassed by the scene and wished I hadn’t come with my son in the first place sliding in a jab “it’s not like you need the class anyway.” This hurt me because when I was 18 my dad cut me off financially ‘for being gay’ and I put my gymnast/dance background to use dancing exotically. She knows it.So it actually hurt me and fairly deeply.I asked why she would say that and she said she was “so embarrassed” she no longer wants to go to class with me. I asked her again, why she was so embarrassed and she stated I ‘came out’. I didn’t. Yes she already knew I was married to a woman and no she never had a problem with it.I told her I’m not going to stop going when it’s already been paid for.

I asked if anyone could spot me this one time and Rebecca paid for my coffee. I thanked her, it was like 2 dollars. We just walked around and did some window shopping and all seemed to be fine.As we were wrapping up and walking back to campus, Rebecca said \"Oh yeah, OP, you owe me for that coffee earlier.\" I laughed because I genuinely thought she was joking and a few other girls laughed too. Rebecca immediately got defensive and it became clear she was serious. I said, \"Oh, sorry, I thought you were kidding because it was like $2.50...\" Rebecca went on this weird rant about how I don't know her status and how I was making her feel bad about her income and how I was being really classist and weird about something that wasn't that big of a deal. This made me see red because Rebecca is RICH. Like generational wealth rich. She didn't even need to go to college, but she went because her parents thought it would be good for her and she wanted to have the \"college experience\". Yes, this girl is basically at university for fun. She also makes a lot of ignorant comments about other people's money and income.I pointed this out to her and said that while two dollars isn't that big of a deal at all, it was ridiculous for her to ask for it paid back when she has millions of dollars in a trust fund since she was born. She got really upset at this and stormed off, then sent me a series of pissed texts and hasn't replied to me.

He dies suddenly without warning. My FIL died in January of 22 from broken heart syndrome. I've always been close to my husband's family. They love me. The death of my husband didn't change anything between us, it united us. My MIL and I speak every day. We are close.Info: After losing 2 family members in such a short time, after the funerals, solving the estates, etc, we talked about taking a family trip. A week in a cabin in the woods by the lake, or going to Disney, or somewhere in Europe. Do something for us, to feel better.The plan was always to go me, my two BILs, SIL, and MIL.Last year BIL and SIL went to London for their honeymoon. They had been together for 25 years and after having kids that are now adults, decided to go on that trip. When they returned, they mentioned wanting to go to Italy in 2024. BIL (P) mentioned wanting to go, and I too said I wanted to go. MIL too. We decided that this would be our family trip after dealing with two deaths.I mentioned how important that trip was, as I've been dealing with grief and really needed it. Every time the occasion came and we talked about Italy the conversation was the same. We can't wait! It'll be fun! We need it! It'll bring us closer as a family!Not once did I hear, or felt like I wasn't part of that conversation. Not once. Always included, and no one ever mentioned that I wouldn't be welcomed.Tonight MIL messaged me and we talked about her day. Then, she mentioned that BIL, SIL, and BIL2 are going to Rome in May. She said she couldn't afford it so she's not going and is sad. This was news to me. I replied that I was hurt and heartbroken that I wasn't asked. Especially after talking about a trip and Italy for so long. I was honest with my feelings and told her it would change things for me and the family and how much part of it I feel.She mentioned how for Christmas they bought me my car carpets, and they were expensive and how I shouldn't feel sad or less part of the family or less loved by them. They assumed I wouldn't be able to afford it (I can). They thought I wouldn't like it because I prefer to plan ahead while they don't (It doesn't matter to me).I told her that the carpet and the trip were two different conversation for me. That it didn't change anything, they didn't ask. Or even consider me once. All the trip was discussed, planned, and paid without asking me once. I apologized for making her feel like I sounded like I wasn't thankful, but as a widow who is lonely, I was really looking for that trip.I want to call BIL tomorrow and ask what happened. If I did something to make them feel like I couldn't be part of the trip. I genuinely wanna know.WIBTA?",

I live about 20 minutes from my moms(66) house and have let her dog out many times last minute unplanned. She asked me what I was doing today and I explained that I would be having friends over for dinner this evening, she asked if she stayed out “too late” for lunch if I would let her dog out. I assumed because she was leaving at 11:30 for lunch at 12:30 that her version of late was 3:30-4. At 5 o’clock she texted me and asked if I would go over and walk her dog to pee. I explained that my guests were already here and that I had assumed she was already home. At this point my exclusive BF baby was also hungry but I didn’t say that. She blew up on me saying that I was supposed to be responsible for her dog and that she was depending on me. I explained to her that I couldn’t just leave my guests and that I figured she was already home when she didn’t text me earlier. She hung up on me then texted me a few minutes later saying “ You know, I always thought that you would have my back if I needed you because nobody else does so” and I said “I’m sorry that you feel that way, I’ve come to let her out quite a few times when it was last minute. Like I said when you didn’t text me by 3:30-4 I figured you were home.” she responded with “ Do you ever take responsibility ? I depended on you to take care of my dog. And yes, I may have asked you to come over and walk her a couple of times it takes 30 minutes to do that so I’m sorry that I’ve taken up that much of your time. Don’t worry it will not happen again I promise you that.” I haven’t responded and I really don’t know how because I don’t feel like what I did was wrong. She knew I was having people over and waited until 5 to text me after she had been gone for almost 6 hours. Now she is blaming me for not dropping everything to make a 50 minute trip not 30, because she didn’t feel like coming home. AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for threatening to pull my kid out of a basketball tournament?",
	"body" : "Edit: I appreciate the constructive criticism from the comments. That is what I was looking for when I posted in the first place. I felt like the situation should have been handled differently but wasn't sure what we were doing wrong. Moving forward my husband and I (who have no experience in school sports) will try to have better and more realistic expectations and make proper changes to our interactions with her coach.Just a little background info: my husband and I have a 6th grade daughter (12yo). This is her first year at a small Christian school and she wanted to be involved in sports with her friends. She made their volleyball team and grew a lot during that experience. She also tried out for basketball and made the team. She's never played contact sports and it was a bit of a learning curve for her (and still is) but she tries. Her team has played a few games and she played minimally which she said she was fine with because it was still so new to her.Recently the school got together with a number of other Christian schools to have a tournament on the weekend. My husband was excited to see our daughter play because his work schedule has caused him to miss most of her games so far. Our daughter's school required the players to be at the school where it was taking place (in another town) at 8:30AM for a game at 8:50AM. She played very little. No big deal. She's no Michael Jordan or LeBron James. We understand that she won't be playing a lot because she's still a beginner. Her second game was at 1PM. Yes, several hours later. We watched the whole game. This team was tough, but our daughter's team pulled ahead by 15 points. There was 2 minutes left in the game and our daughter was finally put in. For less than 30 seconds of playing time. I know 30 seconds is a lot in basketball, but the other team hadn't even scored in that time.My husband was pissed and wanted to go home. Half of his day off was gone and he had seen his daughter play less than 2 minutes total for both games. We approached the coach and told her we wanted to know why our daughter wasn't getting much playing time and said we were going to leave with our daughter if she wasn't going to get a chance to play even when her team is ahead and there is less than 5 minutes left in play. The coach told us she had had a conversation with the team before the start of the first game saying some of the players would be doing a lot of cheering and encouraging and not much playing because it was a tournament and they really wanted to bring home the trophy for the girls. She also essentially said our daughter wouldn't be doing really any playing in the next game either, and made another comment about how she shouldn't be discussing this at this time and she needed to go. The next game wasn't for another hour and a half. Our daughter wanted to stay and cheer on her friends so we let her,  but it left a bad taste in our mouths.Yes, our daughter was no star player and we didnt expect her to play a lot, but the kids are in 6th grade. There were a couple other girls who had little playing time and only in the second half of the game. I think they should be allowed to be more than benchwarmers and to do more than cheer for their teammates for an entire game. Am I completely out of touch? Were we just being overprotective, helicopter parents?",

	"title" : "AITA for telling/ not telling my cousin’s bf the baby might not be his?",
	"body" : "My cousin and I moved in together recently since she broke things off with her boyfriend and was officially ready to move on. She had a tinder and was talking to multiple people, which is fine, however she found out she was pregnant not long after. There are 3 or 4 guys I know she was hooking up with during the time she should have gotten pregnant (I calculated this based on her official due date). She told her ex boyfriend and claims it is his and I don’t think he has any idea she has been hooking up with other people. I asked her if she’s sure it is his and she said yes, but she can’t possibly know that. I don’t think he was even around during that week of conception, but could be wrong. Even if they did, there’s still a chance it’s not his. They also were together for years without getting pregnant and did nothing at all to prevent pregnancy so she said in the past she thought she was infertile. Now I’m wondering if maybe he is the one that can’t have kids. It has been weighing on me as I am the only person that knows this information. I don’t want to go behind her back and tell him and leave her in a bad situation as she currently has no car or job and relies on him to get where she needs to go but it’s still pretty fucked up to me that she wasn’t honest and didn’t think to do a DNA first. Maybe she is scared or clueless I don’t know. I asked my mom what she thinks I should do and she said to mind my own business and hopefully if it’s not his the truth will come to light. I have severe anxiety and confrontation does not come easy to me. I was thinking of sending an anonymous message to him but don’t know what to say or how to do that. His family is also already super invested and she spends most of her time with them. If the baby is not his, it would crush them. Would I be the ahole to say something?

	"body" : "I( 28 F) been with my husband(28 M) for 9 years and married for 2. Over the years I’ve had countless disagreements with my SIL(32 F). She is on drugs and had bpd that she refuses to undergo treatment for.Over the years there has been a repeating pattern of her being super nice to husband and I for a few months and then switching and being extremely hostile and nasty.The last 2 years she has really had it out for me. I work in the adult entertainment industry. My husband and I both discussed this career choice and he is comfortable with the work I do( for reference it’s stripping and online content). I don’t actually have sexual relations with anyone. Well SIL is not happy about this and has called me a slut and whore and had said I bring shame to the family numerous times. I don’t really care about that and still always made an effort to at least be civil. The real kicker is that on Christmas Day we announced we are expecting our first child after 6 years of infertility I got pregnant naturally. Obviously we are so happy and excited but when my husband told her the news she said I’m so sorry! He was like what no congratulations? and she was like I can’t say that all I can say is I’m sorry.She then proceeded to attack me saying I am the reason she doesn’t get to see her brother and that I stop him from talking to the family and that I’m the reason he struggles with his mental health( he recently had a severe mental health crisis but is doing better now) . Which isn’t true at all, if anything I encourage him to see his family more because he is pretty anti social and a house hermit that prefers to stay home. Then husband tells me that she told him he should get a paternity test since I’m such a slut and it’s mighty convenient that I finally got pregnant. He has called her out numerous times on her behaviour but it doesn’t stop her.Husband still tries to be friendly with her as that it’s what his dad wanted and his dad passed away 2 years ago so for the sake of respecting his dads wishes he still tries to have a good relationship with her. I however am done at this point and refuse to speak to her or even acknowledge her presence when we visit his mum. Now his mum is saying I should be more forgiving and let it go that she has said so much nasty things about me because lately( the last month) she has been really good and stable and it’s not her fault she treats people like this because she has a mental illness. I disagree because like I said she can be really nice for a period of time but it never lasts and in the next couple of weeks or months I know she will be back to her usual antics and I honestly just hate her at this point.Husband respects my views and understands why I feel the way I do but I get the impression he also thinks I should just let it go and forgive her.

We split bills 50/50. They told me when I came back from vacation over new years on the 8th (over text) that they didn’t get hired on full time and no longer had a job and doesn’t have rent for January.. I ended up paying my part of rent and begging my landlord to give them more time. They gave an additional 2 weeks to get rent together. I asked my roommate just a few days ago if they almost had rent and they said no, that they will not be paying and supposedly will be moving out next week. They have completely ignored and avoided me all month, so much so that they won’t even have an in person talk with me. I just got the electric bill in and asked them if they are going to pay their part and they have not responded yet. I have already switched the WiFi pw so they can’t use it because it’s not free so I feel it’s only necessary for the power to go next. I have the breaker box in my room behind a locked door. So will I be the asshole of if I cut the power to their room when they inevitably say they will not be paying their part of electric?Ps. It wouldn’t be a big deal but I have a 3 year old and I am already barely making ends meet, electric is 260 this month due to needing the heater and with her not paying rent this puts me in a bind this next month trying to catch up on what she didn’t pay.Edit for clarity: this person has been working door dash since I came back (so they have money) and agreed to pay rent within the additional 2 weeks given. It’s coming down to the wire and now is saying they won’t. I opened my door to them in the beginning and they didn’t pay rent, buy food or any other living necessities for several months, all out of my pocket. At this point I just feel used and all the help I gave is just in the wind because now they are doing me dirty by just bailing.

She spent a lot of time with her great grandma as a child and they grew apart for a while but became close again when my daughter reached adulthood, its a beautiful relationship.My daughter hasn't been able to visit for a while because shes away for school, so last week while I visited my grandma I mentioned to her that my daughter changed her name. When she realised it was about her name she just lit up and seemed so happy! It was a great moment, especially as there have been points where she cant even remember my daughters existence - not to mention shes always been a very serious and less-emotional person, so these moments feel extra precious. I know my daughter spent a long while planning how she would incorporate grandma's name into her own and so I was really happy to see that my grandma liked it and felt honoured by it. I thought my daughter would be thrilled to find that out. Recently she has been declining a lot and we're all worried about her and trying to arrange a visit, including my daughter, but I just wanted to make sure someone told grandma about the name change before things got bad and she forgot.Later, I told my daughter about this but she got quiet and upset without telling me why. I only told my grandma about the name change because my daughter has been out of state for a few months and didn't have enough money to come back and visit but my daughter seems really upset over this. AITA?EDIT to clarify: In a text she told me I 'crossed a line' but wont say anything more when I ask. She was excited to see her grandma again until I said this so I do think she wanted to do it herself. grandma is still somewhat lucid maybe half the time but she might forget about the name too.",

Nothing crazy, but I'm 5'11, and 170 lbs, up from ~145 in college. I used to have abs, but I haven't really cared as much about working out anymore, since I just feel comfortable in our relationship, and I know she doesn't care what my body looks like.We recently went out on a double date with some friends that I haven't seen in a while, Jack and Erica (fake names). We're all having a good time at dinner, joking around. Jack and I have known each other for a long time, and always tease each other, so he makes fun of me and says that it looks like I've gotten a bit chubby since we last saw each other. I laugh it off since that's how we've always been, and since it's not really true, I just have a slight gut now. His girlfriend Erica joins in and says that Jack has been working on his beer belly too, which Jack definitely has put on a few pounds recently like me. Jack says that we've both put on some happy relationship weight gain and grown guts. I say that I got the Boyfriend 20, joking that I've gained 20 pounds while dating my girlfriend. The conversation changed from there, but we were all laughing about it.Once we get home, my girlfriend says that I embarrassed her in front of my friends by saying that I said she made me fat. I get upset because she just inadvertently called me fat when I never said that at all, just that I had gained weight. I told her that I was just joking and that she shouldn't have taken it so seriously, especially because Erica was making the same type of jokes about Jack. I was also frustrated because she was making me feel bad about my weight gain, which I had never really cared about before. I told her that I know I'm responsible for myself getting a little chubby, but I didn't really care because I felt less pressure to look perfect while dating her. I guess this was the wrong thing to say because she got more upset.Am I the asshole?Edit: I weighed myself after making this post, and I'm actually 178 lbs right now, so a little heavier than I originally thought. I also have made jokes in the past about getting chunkier, but I've never used the word \"fat\" to describe myself, since I don't think it's true.A few of you were asking in the comments about my girlfriend's weight, and she's very healthy and has always been.

	"body" : "Typically, I'm quite busy as a grad student, so I only get about an hour to myself at the end of the day sometimes before I have to prep for the next day and go to bed. During said hour, I often play video games. I'm very introverted, so my alone time is very valuable to me. Sometimes, I call my girlfriend (let's call her Jane) while I'm playing and talk with her while I play. She doesn't live with me, so it's how we catch up at the end of the day. Additionally, we are both aware that we sometimes will multitask while we are on the phone together and we are both ok with this.Last night around midnight, after Jane initially called me and we talked, she wanted to call again. She was depressed yesterday as well. Admittedly, I wanted to go ahead and go to sleep. I have to get up fairly early, my sleep is very important to me, and my social battery was pretty drained by the time she first called me last night. Further, her mood improved by that point and we had already talked about her depression in the earlier call.  It was our nine-month anniversary yesterday as well, but with both our busy schedules, we didn't get much chance to celebrate. This also influenced my decision. I felt bad telling her no, so I told her she could call me again.Twenty minutes later, she FaceTimed me back. I'll be honest: the twenty-minute time period frustrated me, but I tried not to let it show.  At one point on the call, I asked if she was ok. She said she was sleepy, so I told her she should go to sleep. She said no, because she wanted to talk to me. I told her I was going to go sleep soon anyways, which she seemed to be a bit upset about. I realized this, so I told her I'd stay on the call for ten more minutes. I figured \"ok, ten minutes gives her the extra time she wants, and gives me enough time to wind down to sleep at a decent hour\".Two minutes later, she suddenly wanted to hang up. I was already feeling guilty, because I felt like I wasn't being as patient as I could have, but I was also tired. I basically asked her if she wanted to hang up because of me. Long story short, through that exchange, she got confused and thought I said that I wanted her to hang up. She asked me if I wanted her to hang up, in a tone of voice that sounded hurt. Admittedly, I did not react the best to this. I got frustrated, and thoughtlessly rolled my eyes and sighed (I had forgotten she could see me) . In a tight, but not raised, tone of voice, I said \"no sweetie, I don't want to hang up, I want to know if you want to hang up\".This made her sad and this is the offense I'm asking about. My frustration in that moment was stemming from desperation and my own guilt. I felt bad because I was tired and wanted to sleep. I felt trapped because it seemed like no matter what I did, short of staying on the phone with her all night, I wasn't going to win. I wanted to know what she wanted. So, Reddit, AITA?",

The first week went fine, but then he began drinking again. We went to our cabin along with my little sister and it was all going fine until we had to go back home. The issue started with my sister begging me to sit in the front seat. I could tell my father was borderline drunk so I told her no, because if we possibly crashed due to him not being fully sober, she would be out of harms way. Because of this, she was very angry with me for the rest of the day. Meanwhile, I knew I had made the right choice as my father decided it would be a great idea to drink more as we drove. (and I say this with heavy sarcasm) He began saying ridiculous things, like he would die very soon and that the phone works both ways and if I loved him I would move to Europe with him. I began full on crying because I was stressed and I didn’t want to hear about him dying or about the other crap he was spouting. We finally got home and a couple of hours, and a six pack later, he barged into my room with a new mattress. Saying that the last thing he wanted to do for me before he left was to get me a proper mattress to sleep on, even though I was already happy with what I had. I was angry because he was drunk and stressed because I earlier and began pushing him away and telling him to get out.

After my partner asked if we could have a joint one instead which was totally fine except now the two exes would have to see each other (also fine I had thought).Unbeknownst to us my BIL had started to see someone else closer to the time of the baby shower (it had been about 2 weeks at the time of my baby shower) which is where the problem for comes. He had asked my MIL(64f) and SIL if he could bring her and they mentioned it to my husband and I and we both said no, it's not the appropriate or right time. He seemed to accept that and then said he would bring her the next weekend when we were moving house and again we said no, not the right time.Come to the morning of the shower and I am getting my makeup done by my friends as gift and my husband gets a phone call and I could tell by him going into another room and his tone what it was about. His brother had shown up to the venue before anybody else with the NEW gf (also 42f). I was so livid and close to tears and it made me feel like not going to my own baby shower. My MIL had told SIL to not say anything and just keep quiet. When I arrived I was still in shock and it was awkward meeting them to say the least. I avoided them as much as possible.My MIL had also invited a cousin (m) and his wife because they had helped my FIL during the pandemic with advice and such which I was also against but she pleaded with my husband so we just said yes to them.I just felt completely disrespected and that me saying no didn't count for anything at all.It had eventually come out the problems they caused but they don't see that they did anything wrong and I was told only recently that she didn't actually want to come but it was BIL who said that he wanted her there.Side note: He also at my birthday dinner a few months later chose that time to ask his brothers to be his groomsmen because \"it's hard getting everyone all together at the same time\" which also had me fuming.Sorry this post was waay longer than I expected",

	"body" : "MIL grew up very poor in a rural village in my country.Even when her economic situation improved, her mentality always remained the same as at least 20 years before.She and I could never have gotten along (we literally don't understand each other when we speak, because she only use their very strict dialect), but for the love of my husband (who ran away from there very young and now settled in the city where we have lived for more than twenty years), I have always tried to find some common ground and make compromises.She, however, never did the same, always and only waited for things to go the way she wanted (she stopped asking when we would return to live in the village very recently, for example). The relationship has never been established, conflicts have been frequent and also tensions with my husband, who is more accommodating and rightly feels love towards her.Two years ago, we have had the opportunity to purchase a beach house, and we decided to take it in their region, it made it easy for her to come and spend some time with her grandson (my BIL doesn't drive).First year, everything was beautiful and she was very happy.Second year, she was tight on money (BIL has a loss-making shop and she pays off his debts with her pension), and she didn't want to come.Since we don't ask for money, we insisted, and in the end she agreed to come for ten days.For ten days she didn't say a word. Literally. She sat on the terrace looking outside, she didn't speak to her nephew, the only words she uttered was to complain that we didn't let her make houseworks. She blatantly tried to eat as little as possible. My son often asked why granma ignored him even when they were alone.Now. She's 80 and she doesn't know better, but she probably suffers from anxiety, and one can totally understands her difficulty and discomfort.But those ten days were very long. Once accepted, you have to overcome the first impact, you cannot behave like this. I know, because I suffer from anxiety and not even in my worst crises did I treat the people around me this way.My husband keeps insisting that that was not directed at us, it was her shame not to have money with her. I insist that it was the alibi she gave herself to justify a behavior that she herself would have stigmatized if she had heard it done by someone else.Unfortunately, after twenty years of efforts and attempts to meet her (I agreed to organize a second wedding reception in the village, so that she could invite whoever she wanted and have the traditional wedding of the son she so desired), I reached the point of breaking up, and six months after, I can't get over it, I limit any interaction, I don't have no  intention to invite her to participate in our life again.We wanted to be a family, but I think  that no good deed goes unpunished.AITA?",

	"body" : "This one is for my vape users, if you are bothered by this kind of stuff I recommend not reading this and please don’t comment any rude things about vaping, I know it’s bad for me lol.I use a vape that requires juice, I get a new bottle of juice every Monday and in the bottle is just enough to last me a week, that is if no one else uses it. However, I’m not that kind of person to be selfish and I let my mates use it when they want. That is until it gets too much, sure I’m sharing it but I do have rules over it. I am as much as a nicotine addict as them so it’s only fair if I have rules over my own vape.My mate does not buy vapes of their own often, instead they use other peoples, that is okay, however, they take a lot of puffs. Since mine takes juice and is not disposable, taking a lot of puffs drains the juice, this has somewhat annoyed me but I have brushed it off until now.I let my friend use my vape as usual, unfortunately, it’s Friday and the juice bottle is running low, i take a puff and realise the vape is out so I use what’s left in the bottle (barely anything) I then conclude this will not last me until I get a new bottle so I decide to put my vape away for the rest of the day. My friend, however, is not happy with my decision and begged for it back, I told them no yet they still asked so I folded and told them only to have a bit. They do not, they use it untill there is a tiny dribble left despite me saying to only use it once. I then put it away again. My friend goes to leave my house after I say goodbye until they ask for one more puff before they leave, I refuse but then feel bad so I give it to them (one puff couldn’t hurt right?). Annoyingly they do not take one puff and continues to take around 10 long pulls without even taking a breath in between as if it was about to run away, they just kept going completely oblivious to the fact I said to only take one. I stop them and take MY OWN vape back as they ask for one more, I say no sternly checking the juice inside to see none left at all, the coil had burnt due to them taking long puffs and draining the juice. I feel bad for saying no but at the end of the day it’s my vape and I now have to wait a few days until I can use it again. Am I the asshole ",

Well, our friends came over and stayed for about 3-4 days, and revealed some information to us about alcohol causing relationship issues and some other things. We were respectful enough to not order alcohol if we ate out and we were careful to not mention alcohol around them as we know it can be triggering. Our friends flew home after a couple of days and we thought that everything was fine. I noticed that the one friend that usually speaks to me at least on an every few days basis was not responding to messages. I thought this was strange but let it go. After about 3 weeks of not talking I receive a message from this friend about how they will no longer be speaking to us and she didn’t specify why. It was a very vague message and to be quite honest it had me going through the entirety of their stay wondering what happened. These are friends that we have experienced a lot with and ending a long friendship so abruptly seemed weird. I let it go, and sent the friend a message two weeks later to ask if we could discuss this issue, as it bothered both of us quite a bit. The friend refused to speak about it with me. So, we figured that it was just over and we’d go our separate ways. A week later, I receive a series of messages explaining how upset and appalled they were with us for having alcohol in our house after the recent issues it had caused. For reference, we have a bottle of beer in the very back of the fridge and a liquor bottle in the freezer. During the visit, late a night one night the husband in the relationship drank half of the liquor and the entire beer. We didn’t notice due to not consuming alcohol often enough. This caused a fight between the two them and subsequently caused them to blame us for making it available. I understand that this can cause issues having it available, but for us to drink so infrequently it was an afterthought. I understand alcoholism is a serious thing, but should it be completely our fault if he chose to drink it?ETA: they stalled on telling us the issue, but the majority of our mutual friends seemed to know as soon as they got home. Our mutual friends live near us and these friends moved for work. It took these friends nearly a month to tell us the issue.",

He doesn't really have a job since he resigned from being a computer programmer nearly a decade ago so I have been relying mostly on my brother's monthly allowance to get by since my mother resigned from her job as well. Alex and my mother, Eden, are separated and don't really talk with each other due to some personal issues regarding their marriage.Before, Eden used to hold the bank card that my brother, David, would send money into and it would be her who then sends the money here. This had caused a bit of a struggle because money is usually short and we would barely be able to cover all of our daily expenses for the month. When I met up with her during Christmas however, she then gave me the card and said that I can keep it as long as I promised her that Alex doesn't know and that he won't be involved in our finances. She doesn't really trust my father with anything and since him and David had a recent falling out, he agreed as well. I said yes and accepted it because it would be much less of a hassle once I can control the money directly.When I got back however, I knew that I couldn't really keep it a secret from my father since most of our household expenses are intertwined and he doesn't have much of a source of income. I haven't been holding the money back and I have been paying what was needed but I haven't been eager to hand the money out either. This is because Alex doesn't really have the best track record of keeping money and I knew that my mother and brother would be disappointed in me if they found out how fast the money from the account went. They aren't really fond of him.Recently, Alex has compared me to our family members and is talking about how I am just like them. He says that he isn't out to steal my money and that he's hurt I think otherwise. He tried to start a conversation about how excited he was to hear that I won most of the New Year's games and how much I earned but I brushed him off because I was studying for my exams and I was worried about the brownout that wouldn't stop. I don't really think he's out to get me, I'm just worried since I know that Eden and David would scold me if they see that the money has been running away quickly when I am only one person. David has said before that he was willing to stop sending money when he and my father got into an argument so I don't really want to get on his bad side. I've been extra cautious to only use the money and let others know when necessary but perhaps I have been too cautious. AITA?",

Certain sounds can make me irrationally upset or angry but I can deal with it most of the time, especially when it comes to kids we foster.

He seemed shocked when I said I didn’t think it was the right fit. I explained that I couldn’t deal with the constant vocal stims. I can get very irritated when noises are bothering me and snap at whoever is causing them which would also be unfair on Ted. I don’t want him to feel like he has mask.My husband has hardly spoken to me since and I got a very angry phone call from his sister calling me an ableist.

But  I would say we have drifted apart and now she only messages me when she wants something. The last year has been really hard on me. My grandfather died of cancer, my best friend of twenty years ended our friendship abruptly and I have had multiple seizures sometimes back to back to back. Earlier this year her dogs [multiple] died suddenly and when it happened in August I was there for her.I sent her a sympathy card, stayed up late with her on skype just listening to her vent and even got her an ornament of her dogs to give her some comfort. I did this several times and even would randomly call her just to remind her that I love her and that I am here for her. I listened every time she recited the horrible story of how her dogs died; no matter how upset it made me. I now know where she was, when and how it happened and could easily recite it by heart. I understand she was traumatized which is why I feel awful.But  here's the thing, A has never been the best pet owner, she never fixes her pets or takes them to the vet but has money for things like plushies and comic books, and her dog had been sick for months. I begged her to take the dog to the vet but she sighted she can't afford it. And then back in November around thanksgiving I got a skype call from my grandfather. He was 90 years old and dying of cancer and although I only got 10 yrs with him [he lived in a third-world country] I was so close to him. I had the worst thanksgiving ever and when he said goodbye he even asked me to tell him it was ok to go.Last week, A called me and wished me a happy new year; she was late but whatever. She asked me how I was and I told her that I will be ok but it's my first year without him in the last decade. She asked me if I was okay and I said \"not really,\"  and that I am struggling. Here's where I might be the asshole, she said, \"Yeah I know how you feel my dog left a hole too.\" and proceeded to recount the way her dogs died *yet again.*I told her, \"Yes I know but can we not talk about this again? I really need to vent and it's not the same as losing a pet.\" I know she misses them but I am grieving and really just needed someone to listen to me; I know she isn't my therapist but come on.And she told me that the pain of losing my grandfather was *equal* to the pain of losing my grandfather because she was just as traumatized as I am. I lost it, I just lost it.  I snapped at her, \"I don't CARE that your dog's died! I get it! THEY DIED! Can we focus on me for Once?! My grandfather is dead!\" and I broke down crying while she called me an asshole and hung up leading to a barrage of texts calling me a heartless asshole.  Was I though?

We were trying to be there for both of them, as she was particularly distraught, moving out and struggling with mental health not being in a stable family unit anymore (wasn't like that at all prior to the break up).My husband was routinely going to the gym with Mike and hanging out afterwards. Hubby was coming back from these meetings not wanting to talk to me which was creating tension in our relationship, then would eventually blurt out stories of his buddy's new multiple exploits from Tinder, including details of hook ups that were occurring while I was socialising with his ex Jessica who thought Mike was out with another mutual friend (Jake). Mike and Jessica were still working out childcare arrangements for their kids at this point and Jessica was looking after the kids while Mike was going out for these dates/hook ups.Jake the mutual friend was also calling up my husband and for lack of a better description was gossiping about the situation, glorying in Mike's exploits somewhat (which included one of his friends)  Jake was calling my husband occasionally in my presence not knowing I was there (while driving and phone was on speaker) and at the end of one call said not to tell me to my husband which made me feel pretty uncomfortable. I was feeling really anxious trying to be there for my friend but knowing that her ex was doing what they were doing, sometimes while we were catching up. I couldn't tell her for fear of her mental health, and it wasn't my place, but it was placing a burden on me I felt really uncomfortable with, and anxious that if Jessica found out that I knew it would make matters worse, for our friendship and her mental health.Anyway things came to a head about a month ago when Mike confronted my husband at our house while I was cooking dinner after I ignored him at the gym earlier that day (by this point I couldn't even stand looking at him). I told him I was finding it really difficult knowing about all his new partners while trying to be there for Jessica and it was a burden on my conscience. He didn't get it at all and was flummoxed by my concerns. I said I felt guilty about it, like I was lying to Jessica knowing about it and wished he would tell her. That I felt annoyed it was expected my husband keep secrets from me and that it was causing problems for our communication. He said it was none of her business, which I kind of understand, but my problem was that we were getting caught in the middle. I asked him if he felt any guilt, to which he took great offense and left.Moving forward a month they've both ghosted us. We both still feel sick about the whole thing, but honestly are glad to be out of the whole shit show. Am I the Asshole?EDIT/ADD- Couple of people asking for more details- there is a 3000 character limit on the initial post so was a lot I couldn't include.They had been going to counselling for a while but if there was any trigger for the separation it is that he is about to get a big lump sum from a relative. He'll be able to live mortgage free while she won't be able to afford a house with her leftover capital after financial separation.He had been badmouthing her to anyone that listened. A friend mentioned at a dinner party where neither were present that he'd been making comments that their kids were happier without her around (not true by the way and ignores the fact their youngest was routinely crying whenever they were doing child handover), that she was stalking him (while he had an app on his phone tracking her, she did not) and that she was entirely responsible for the break up.Her mental health has been bad enough for her to mention it to me and my husband (no S word allowed here...) He said she was playing the victim card.Happy to embrace the asshole tag, but it should be worth noting that he came over to my house to complain to my husband that I wasn't interested in having anything to do with him anymore. So I might be an asshole in this situation sure, but I think personally he's an asshole that I don't want around me or my teenage sons or daughter, and I'm glad he's spending less time with my husband while he's hooking up with free abandon and relaying his exploits with glee while his ex and co parent is in pieces trying to build their new life.",

	"title" : "AITA My 6 year old son received no Xmas presents from our family, AITA for being upset?",
	"body" : "One year ago I relocated to Florida with my wife and two boys. This Christmas we traveled back home  to spend the holiday with family, like every Christmas. Our family has a tradition of literally gathering around the tree on Christmas  and handing out presents to each other. Over the years the family has grown, and my cousins had their own children. A few years back we stopped giving presents to the cousins and their kids (who are now in college) because it was too much and everyone agreed as such. Fast forward to this Christmas, we are gathered around the tree. My sister's son who is the same age as my older son, 12, gets bombarded with presents from the family. Both of my kids ages 12 and 6, got nothing from anyone. Now, here's what irks me. My wife and I always made it a point to give presents to my cousins and their kids until their kids were in high school. Every year my sister and her son get a gift from us. She gave us nothing. My younger son, 6, is very aware of his surroundings. He said to me \"Dad, I thought this was my family, how come they didn't give me anything?\" Im a grown man, but when he said that it felt like a Tommy Morrison left hook. I thought we were closer to the family so as not to be completely overlooked. He picked up on this on his own without my wife and me saying anything. After he said that, I got pissed considering the presents rule was overwhelmingly broke for my sister's kid but followed for ours. Not to mention we always gave gifts to the cousin's kids from the time they were born through high school, never missed a beat. We also made sure this year, as every year, to give my sister, her husband and her son a gift as well, they gave us nothing. There are no social issues or strains with that side of the family but their oversight really annoyed me since THEIR kids were never overlooked. I also don't get the focus on my sister's kid since he's an unremarkable couch potato while both my kids are very active in the community and school, and are far from loafers. It was very disappointing and I'm looking at the family through a different lense after this Christmas,  AITA?",

They just announced they are expecting their third, and my first reaction was an exasperated sigh, which understandably angered them. I explained myself as best as I could but they are still insisting I’m an AH who “hates their kids.”Here’s the thing. I love my nephew and niece, and I am going to love the third. But Lucas and Lily require so much help already that having a PLANNED third right now seems… unwise.Since my niece was born (the 3-year-old) Lucas has lost three jobs. He left the first job willingly for another one that me, my fiancée, and our parents all tried to tell him was a scam, and it was. His first job wouldn’t hire him back. He recently lost his third job because he got into a shouting match with coworkers over something minor.He’s now trying to launch his own business. Our dad gave him a hefty loan, but Lucas has spent it poorly and his business is not going to take off anytime soon. Additionally, they moved from their 2-bedroom apartment into a 3-bedroom, which I get, but they can’t afford it. Every couple of months me or our mother will put money out for their rent.Lily works very part time. Lucas is trying to do DoorDash as much as he can. I watch the kids in some capacity 3 days a week, and they stay the night with me once per week. I do this because I love them and their home environment isn’t the best because Lucas and Lily are always stressed and arguing. On top of working myself, this is tiring.Now that the third is on the way, I know they will need more money and more help, and I get more tired thinking about it. I apologized for my initial reaction but they’re saying I’m an AH and don’t like them or their kids.I also noticed they didn’t cancel me watching them this week so I’m not sure if they actually feel that way.AITA?ETA Lily REALLY struggled with her second pregnancy and needed more frequent help with my niece so I’m also anticipating that.",

It always felt weird to call them 'mum' and 'dad' but I did do it.Lennon and Dawn both work creative jobs, Dawn's an art teacher and Lennon's an art illustrator which I thought was cool and led me to spend more time with them, as I did GCSE art and they helped me with that. I've even started spending nights over at their house, which I absolutely love, the decor of the place, and the fact that it's a cottage with chickens in the back. As well as going on days out with them, to get piercings or to museums or anything that seems remotely interesting. It's really brought me closer to them and it led to me seeing them as Mum and Dad, and calling them that.I slipped up at dinner with my adoptive parents the other day though, and whilst talking about what we did on Saturday and I referred to Dawn and Lennon as mum and dad. It's really upset my adoptive parents, they said that they were the ones that had raised me for the last 17 years and not them. They said that Lennon and Dawn having me was irresponsible back then and that it was a good thing they were mature enough to choose adoption, but shouldn't be trying to force their way back in now.I told them that I'm grateful for them raising me, but Dawn and Lennon are also my parents, just because they weren't ready doesn't diminish any connection we have right now.I have been feeling bad about it recently though, as it has upset June.",

Joy is a criminal lawyer so naturally she knows an amount of shady people.I talked to her about it because it seemed like she was bragging to intimidate a person she was talking to.

To explain:Both my partner and I have jobs that wouldn’t allow us to book time off specifically around the date they’ve proposed. We would need to catch red-eye flights and arrive on the day of with little to no sleep involved. This is a non-negotiable conflict, neither of us can take a few days off beforehand given our professions.My partner’s parents have a pre-existing scheduling conflict that would allow them to attend. However, they would essentially arrive a few days before, attend, and then leave.The engaged couple do have an urgency to their wedding and I can understand that. However, I do not understand why they cannot get court room married and then plan a destination ceremony allowing everyone to attend comfortably without the stress. To me, given the urgency, these events can be separate and do not have to be done simultaneously.I feel like we are being forced into a rock and a hard place - we want to attend, but will not be able to present our best selves. My partner is willing to endure because it’s their sibling, but, I am of the opinion we will likely be so stressed out and burnt out that we will fight and not have a good time whatsoever.Naturally I do not have any info from my partner’s fiancés side on why they’ve chosen the proposed date. So perhaps there is a more significant driving force on their end.So WITBA if I put my foot down and say “I’m sorry, but your proposed wedding date does not work with my schedule”.",

I ended up trying my best to get motivated and clean but it felt like nothing was good enough for her and my depression wasn’t an excuse I could use since she apparently also suffered from it and could still “stay motivated”.We managed to work past it and resolve the issue but because she obviously was telling her parents about the issues they came to dislike me. She left to see them for a while and came back very hostile towards me. I left one day for my mothers birthday and came back to an empty fridge. I left for a total of 2 days and the food she claimed was bad I had used the day I left. I confronted her about it and she lost it telling me that she’s sick of the smell of the apartment (I bought as many air fresheners as possible when she was originally having issues to help with that problem despite the apartment being relatively clean and I left almost no food mess). The next day she gave me a two weeks notice and now I’m fighting to get my bond of $880 back which she is refusing.In my frustration I went on my private Instagram account to complain through a post (she is blocked so I’m guessing someone close to her told her). Now she is claiming I’m cyber bullying her and I need to take down the post or she will report me for cyber bullying. I didn’t call her any names or anything I just mainly complained about the situation and how confusing it is and how I needed to understand her bipolar but she refused to understand my depression.AITA?",

	"body" : "Yesterday, I (25M) came home and wanted to take a shower. We can only do that once every two days, to save money. I can wash myself at the sink in the bathroom at all times though. However, yesterday I asked for an exception since I had done physical activity that day and I preferred to shower. She (55F) didn't seem too happy about it, but she allowed it and told me to take a quick shower. I did what we always do when we shower: I turned on the heating, took a quick shower.She got angry when she found out I had turned on the heating. She told me a quick shower didn't require that, waste of energy. I told her I'd leave it off next time I'd take a short shower. She stayed angry and kept complaining about the heating. She called it absurd behavior, excessive use of the heat, and that an adult like me should know better. This went on for a while, to the point that she was still talking to herself about it while I was trying to sleep. She does this more often where she rants about me to herself out loud when I'm in another room.I sat down with her to express how it made me feel. I started out by acknowledging that she didn't like that I showered for two days in a row. I also told her I understand that turning on the heat wasn't a good idea. I then said that it's not fair to express her frustration for so long after. I asked her to share her expectations with me, or express her anger or frustration once in the moment so I'm aware what I'm doing wrong in her eyes and can change my behavior. This didn't click with her, and she went into the same rant as yesterday.I kept trying to push my point until she understood my feelings. The ranting just continued. She also added new things. My towel was ''too wet'' (she asked me to place it under the shower since it leaks sometimes) and she also said I shouldn't turn up the shower heat (I didn't turn up the shower heat). I kept trying to explain to her that she doesn't communicate her expectations clearly, and that she always blames me after the fact and then rants about it for too long. I wanted her to acknowledge this and at least apologize for that.Things got heated, and she got to the verge of tears. Even to the point where she grabbed my shoulders, looked me in the eyes, and told me I shouldn't take it personal and that she loves me. She still never acknowledged or apologized for her behavior. This made me very confused. It made me feel loved, but it completely missed the point. I feel like she just doesn't really understand how to communicate boundaries or expectations. The mixed feelings make me doubt if she means well and that I might just be an asshole for demanding an apology where I should just let things go. AITA?",

She wants to be in lake tahoe, san fran, la, or montana.I usually make a ski trip out to Montana around this time. So i thought itd be cool to combine everything.I planned a ski trip that ends a day after her birthday. So i bought everything plane tickets, sleeping arrangements, food, etc. Mind you my friends would be gone for her actual birthday. I planned for it to be just us.So we wake up on her birthday i gave her a big hug offered to make breakfast and told her the day is yours baby, what do you want to do? Being that we are in montana and its snowing there is not alot to do. So i thought id have her pick so it we could do what she wanted to.Now she has been crying all morning. Im pretty sure its cus i didn’t give her the extravagant birthday morning with breakfast and balloons. Now she will barely talk to me. Would rather “be alone”. Idk what to do.

She can come down while I’m baking in the kitchen, for example, and immediately shout at me to get out and clear the space for her. If I ask her to clean up after her, for example clean the makeup she always leaves in the bathroom, she gets really aggressive and shouts. Even if I don’t ask her to do anything, she gets really aggressive. For example, if I knock on her door, just to tell her I cleaned in the shower and to tell her where I put her stuff, she immediately gets aggressive, and shouts “What do you want?”.If I ask her to not be so angry and aggressive, or to not shout at me like that, she gets even  more angry and shouts that “I’m not aggressive” or “I’m not angry” or “I’m not shouting” or something similar.She’s always like that, no matter how much I try to avoid angering her.So, AITA for calling her for what she is?Edit: Yes, my parents do tell her to not shout and not be so angry and aggressive all the time, and to clean up after her, but it’s not working.

She helped me when I had to say goodbye to my older brother who was going out of the country for school, I was there when her pet bunny passed away, and so on. We'd always had each other to lean on. But things suddenly changed in our last year of highschool. My best friend knew practically everything about me, but I still knew very little about her. I didn't want to pressure her but I of course asked how she was doing or what sort of activities she liked to do, and I would never get an answer. I wanted to respect her privacy so I never pushed. Eventually she told me that she liked to draw. Great! I do too! So we started drawing together and it was so fun, until her drawings got dark. She'd draw graves with our other friends' names on them, or show up to school and show me a page that was covered in her own blood, telling me it was my fault there was blood there. One of the pages about me was a scribbling in sharpie saying things like 'broken and can't be fixed' and then a list of all the mental illnesses she thought I had. I was in a good place mentally until this started. She would bring up things I told her about to make me sad so she could comfort me. She said it made her feel needed so I let her. It wasn't until she told me that she'd rather see me cry than laugh that I knew something wasn't right. I talked to my bf at the time and he told me to stop talking to her. (She didn't like him and made him uncomfortable too) So I did. Eventually, I felt bad and decides to tell her how I felt and why I wasn't hanging out with her anymore. She apologized and said she wouldn't do it again, so I invited her to my birthday sleepover at which she stayed sitting next to my bed to watch me sleep the whole night. I asked her if she needed anything to make her more comfortable but she said she wanted to see if I had nightmares about (insert my past traumatic events). Now that's all I could think of and I didn't sleep that night which I'm sure she knows since she watched me.After another month of avoiding her after that, she angrily texted me saying she was going through the hardest time of her life and that I wasn't there for her. I had no idea what had been going on as she never told me, but she went on about how I was never there for her when she was always there for me.  Which was true, I found out through her mom that her bunny passed not through her, but I tried my best with whatever she told me. I do feel bad that I wasn't the friend she clearly needed during a time when she was hurting. So AITA for not sticking by my ex-best friend's side?",

That way she gets constant writing practice and feedback.Each session I  have her read a short story from The Return of Sherlock Holmes(would need another collection next week) and give her definitions to words she didn’t know, to help her expand her vocabulary.She has a good memory and also works hard at retaining the new words. I also give her some questions. She answers quite well. My uncle isn’t happy though.

How I deal with abandonment issues and how people always seem to stab me in my back. Flash forward to last Friday (January 12), I over reacted about me wanting to sit where I normally sit in math ( I was also nearing my period). I got really pissed off. I ended up leaving early because of a stomach ache. Through text I gave this long ass paragraph on how I was sorry, tell her why I act this way sometimes, and to please be patient with me.

I wore that promise ring our entire 2 year \"engagement\" if you want to call it that. (The time before we got married) 1 weeks before our wedding him and I went to a Jewlery store to pick out my engagement ring and wedding band. Since it was 1 week before the wedding I had to make a decision on what was in stock and at our one local Jewler. I admit I wasn't thinking logically or practically I just loved how big and shiny it was. and I had only had it on for maybe 2 minutes before buying. So didn't realize how heavy it was.  We BOTH decided that day on a ring. This ring is STUNNING. It's a real earth grown ring, 125 diamonds total, it has a double halo, top and bottom bands, it was almost $13,000. It's beautiful. But it's SO heavy and SO uncomfortable. I seriously never wear my ring. If I leave the house I put it on and within seconds of getting home I take it off. In the beginning this bothered my husband but now it's our norm. It's heavy and just not practical at all. Over the years friends have gotten engaged and I've tried other rings on and they feel so comfortable almost like I can't tell it's on! All my friends also tell me my ring is so unbelievably heavy. And over all my style is just totally changed. I like gold- I like dainty- and just from \"live and learn\" if you will I clearly think a smaller ring suits my lifestyle better. Our jerwler store has said they will buy my ring back. So I'm not asking for an additional ring/ in fact we will probably get money back as the rings I've looked at are only $3000-$4000. I mentioned this to my husband and I think he was so hurt. Needless to say he said no. AITA? I just feel like I will have this for the rest of my life I should like it & feel comfortable with it on and WANT it on.

Unfortunately, her family couldn't make it because they live abroad and plane tickets were just not something they could afford, and her other friends either lived in another state or country; she only had me. She was pretty down about not having her parents and siblings.Fast forward to the day of her graduation dinner, which was just the two of us. She is having a photoshoot around campus, and I wake up to a sick dog in the middle of the night. There was no 24-hour vet, so I had to wait till morning. When my dog was checked out because he had been vomiting and feeling ill, the doctor gave me options and medication for my dog and basically told me to keep an eye on my dog, so I had to monitor him. I called my friend; she didn't answer initially because of the photoshoot she was having, and when she finally answered, I explained what was going on and told her I would make up for it on another day. This is not her graduation day (it was a random day we decided), and she had already picked up her diploma days before. She tells me not to worry, and I tell her it's ok, we can reschedule, and I will get another reservation, but she keeps saying that it's ok, I should take care of my dog, and she seemed to be really empathetic at the time.Weeks pass, and I call and text, but she doesn't return my calls and gives me dry messages. Then yesterday, she texted me that she believes she owes me an explanation and basically says that we have outgrown each other and that she didn't feel like I valued her as a friend because I prioritized my dog (just that one time) when she didn't have anyone else. and basically says that we shouldn't be friends anymore.

	"body" : "Hi all, I have an issue with my MIL when it comes to myself and my daughter. I 25f have a daughter 3f who I have taught from as long as I can remember about her boundaries about her body. This includes who she wants to hold her, cuddle her kiss her etc. I have shown her this boundary for so long that she also feels comfortable saying to me if she doesn't want to be touched and I respect it. Now here is where I may be the AH. My MIL had my daughter for the first time this weekend so my partner (her son) and I could go on a date and have some romance, everything went great and my daughter had an amazing time with the in-laws. Fast forward to collecting my daughter and us leaving MIL's house and she picked my daughter up and was smothering her with kisses, this would usually be okay but my daughter was saying no and asking to be put down, however MIL wasn't listening to her so I raised my voice to MIL to tell her to put my daughter down as she's not very comfortable with being kissed.This has now caused tension with me and my MIL as although I apologised for the tone I used, I was then blamed for ruining my MIL's day with my daughter and her saying...\" you did upset me, and spolit my day really.... and i had a lovely day with daughter. And yes you do need  to work on your tone and how you speak to people. I would never do anything to hurt daughter and I'm upset you think I did . But let's move  on\"AITA for raising my voice at her when she overstepped my daughters boundary about being touched and raising my voice with MIL when she wasn't listening to my daughters wishes?EDIT:I've had questions in the comments about sending an apology for my tone just in case I was out of line so I thought I'd post it here too. After leaving her house I spoke to my partner about my tone and he agreed that I was harsh so I texted her an apology straight away;Hey just wanted to apologise for my tone earlier when DAUGHTER said no to kisses. I've taught her the boundary from a young age if she doesn't want to be touched to say no. If I see her saying no and being uncomfortable then I will advocate for her. I do the same with my parents when they do the same. I'm sorry for the way it came across  xxxTo which I got a response of;***Morning OP yes you did upset me, and spolit my day really.... and i had a lovely day with DAUGHTER And yes you do need  to work on your tone and how you speak to people. I would never do anything to hurt DAUGHTER and I'm upset you think I did . But let's move  on xx",

They took a few days to get here, and planned to stay with us (so we are talking 8 extra people at our house) for two nights after they arrive.Between us we made arrangements for all the meals in advance, but I bought a basket of snacks and fruit to have for people to eat in between, and invited everyone to help themselves.In the morning, I am making breakfast as planned, and Kathy comes in the kitchen an asks for an orange peeler. To be fair the oranges aren't like the easy-peel ones, it takes a bit of effort, but I don't have an orange peeler. I looked in the drawers, just in case I had one and forgot, but I really didn't.

My boyfriend and I had also just gotten back from a trip abroad, and had a bunch of stories and photos we wanted to share.I love my sister to bits, but she isn't the most self-aware person in the world, and tends to dominate conversations. Tonight was no exception, and she spent the majority of the time talking about herself, her job, the dates she has been on etc. If me or my boyfriend tried to bring up something about ourselves or the trip, my sister would nod along politely then change the subject back to her. This continued for the rest of dinner.I'm used to my sister being like this, but to be honest I was a bit peeved because I don't see my parents much and I was really excited to talk about the trip. I had also had a few drinks which I think added to the mood.Once my sister had left and my boyfriend and I were in my room (we were staying with my parents), I had a rant to him about how annoying my sister can be, how she always talks about herself and won't let anyone get a word in.It might have been the drink, but apparently I was talking louder than I realised, because my Mum heard what I said. When I went to brush my teeth she confronted me and told me that she didn't like all the mean things I was saying about my sister and how she was disappointed. Fair enough, I was probably harsher than I should have been.I assumed that would be the end of it, except the next day I received a message from my sister saying that Mum had told her what I was saying about her, and how hurt she was. After messaging for a bit I realised she was really upset, and apologised straight away, but she is still mad at me.I feel really awful that I've hurt my sister, but on the other hand I'm pissed at my Mum for telling her what I said. Now, something that was effectively a semi-drunken whine to my boyfriend in private has become a big deal.

I only met him in the first place because my cousin decided to bring her bestie and the bestie decided to bring her brother (guy 18 male) anyways. So me and him started talking we had a great connection not only that it was like love at first sight. A few weeks later me and him started dating everything was going great. I was happy he was happy everything was good until I met his girl best friend. He told me he had a girl best friend and I had a bad feeling about her but I ignored it I just put it as jealousy or having trust issues. So we were dating for about 3 months I finally met the girl best friend because I was otp with him while he was at work. He’s coworkers were gathered around his phone looking at me and calling me all types of names and being disrespectful they didn’t even know me but they was talking about me. I didn’t really say anything back I just ignored them but his girl best friend caught my attention when she decided to threaten me. After that I just hung up and told I’ll call him back but after I met his best friend a month later he changed and didn’t want to be otp with me anymore. The usual stuff guys do to their gfs when they talking to another girl. Anyways another month past we get into a small argument and he breaks up with me. I cried for everyday for two months then I reached out to him asking why did he break up with me he told me i wasn’t good enough and that I was the problem and I always play the victim and that I hurt him. After that I cried more and blamed myself. Soon the truth came out that I wasn’t the problem and he just left me for another girl (the girl best friend). Far forward to last year and now he has apologized more than once. He said he made a mistake and wants us to get back together and work things out. He told me he only wants to be with me ( if that was true why would he or anybody else hurt the person they only and really want to be with). We tried working things out but I had so much sadness and anger in me for him I keep on lashing out and I didn’t trust him at all. So we cut each other off. (That was last year). This year we started back talking and he wants to be friends and be on good terms. But I kinda still have feelings for him and I’m kinda still hurt from what he did. We talked about it and he knows I’m still hurting. He’s response to me letting him know I’m still hurting is that I need to move on from it and that he made a mistake and that I need to stop being stuck in the past. So am I the ahole for being stuck in the past and am I the ahole for not really wanting to be friends with him or be on good terms?By the way him and the girl are not friends anymore. He finally understood that he destroyed our relationship all because his ex girl best friend didn’t want to see him happy with anyone else. She never really wanted him.",

On Dec 30th I told my mom I was going to stay the with my bio dad's family with my dog for new years and she let me go. I spent the 30th with my bio dad's family, and then went hunting for 3 days. My stepdad and everyone on my bio dad's side knew where I was during my hunt.The problem is, someone on my bio dad's side posted a picture online saying \"good luck OP on your and [dog]'s first hunt!\" and my mom saw it.

It was very unpleasant, but I wasn't going to mention it. When my parents held my baby, he'd smell for the rest of the day until I washed his clothes and bathed him. I just put up with it without comment.Then my sister Ruth moved back in with my parents. She uses marijuana medically for a chronic pain condition. She has been helping my parents to renovate their house and is doing a lot of improvements, as the house was falling into disrepair. Meanwhile the smell was growing. There were holidays and they gave us gifts. The wrapping had the smell. Then the gifts. I had another baby and moved into a new house. The clothes and toys they gave the baby reeked. Gifts left on the porch were so pungent that we always knew who they were from. I've visited a few times. It's looking nice, but I can smell the house from the street. When I return, I have to wash before my family will come near me.On Christmas Ruth made cookies. My brother Ron (m 38) immediately asked me if they were \"special\" cookies. No one wanted to eat them. Ruth then spent countless hours making macarons for my dad's retirement party. Ron and his wife both tasted the macarons and didn't want any more because of the herbal aftertaste. I felt terrible because my husband and I didn't want them either. \"We just don't really like macarons,\" Ron told her, sending her home with dozens of uneaten cookies.Ruth wants to bring the house back to its former glory. I asked her if she was going to fix the odor. She said there isn't one. I admitted that her cookies tasted like the house smells and she became infuriated, insulted me, and gave me a chance to take it back and admit I was lying. I told her that I can't stand to see all the hard work she's doing go to waste because of the smoke damage. She works so hard, is so thoughtful, and spends so much money on baking, gifts, and home renovations. Endless smoking indoors every single day for years on end is taking its toll on the house, and no matter how well she seems to clean it, the smell never leaves.She has stopped talking to me. It's been a week and I've also told my mother about the smell. She doesn't believe me and doesn't care, but is demanding that I apologize to Ruth and that I lie about the smell, saying that I must be wrong. Even if I do that, I'll still have to continue washing and/or throwing out anything they give me, and I still can't bring my young kids there until it's dealt with, so this \"argument\" is just going to keep happening. It's a huge growing elephant that no one wants to accept or acknowledge, and I'm not really sure how to proceed. As the middle child, I've always been a huge people pleaser, but with the help of recent therapy, I've been trying to be honest and establish boundaries for myself and my family.So Reddit, AITA?

IF it wasn’t for me she would have no clothes, shoes, food. My dad allows her to stay in the house and if it wasn’t for him we would be homeless. I help out with bills, I buy all groceries and toiletries and give my dad money when he needs some help.Her working would help us tremendously. She contributes nothing. We have been here for 13 yrs and she has done nothing. She told me god said he would get her out of this house ( idk how?). She also told me that before I was born god told her that she would be a millionaire ( again idk how)She has no friends. She sits in the house all day everyday watching videos on YouTube and tv. She does arts and crafts sometimes. She can and feed herself do the  normal ADLs. She says she don’t trust people she has no family on her side (cut off from them for good reasons mother mentally abusive and father sexually abusive). She told me she used to hear god talk to her when she was a child. As I’ve gotten older I realize this may have been from abusive she endured and this voice is probably a coping mechanism.I think my depression and anxiety came from being a trauma dump for my mom as a child and even now . She would tell me about how her parents abused her she complains to me everyday. Everything that comes out of her mouth is negative and is from stuff that happens to her 10+ yrs ago. It’s hard to  listen to constantly when I’m dealing with my own shit and being told it’s demons.Anyways, my bf lives in Chicago. We met at college and he got a job there he told me I could live with him when I’m done with school. I have come to the realization is that I’m not going to have a life of my own.My sister told me that if I cut her off she might get help. Idk if I can…I don’t  want to do that though. I lost out on my teenage years  being stuck in the house and not having fun and experiences because of her coddling. Know I feel like I’m going to miss out on my 20s because I have to care for her. I know I sound like an asshole but what else am I supposed to do? I can’t let her be homeless.",

To me, it was just normal, my parents were fat and it wasn't a big deal because they were gross middle-aged people and nobody wanted to have sex with them anyway.

I realized my parents had poisoned him with their fat cultural vibes. I don't want the same thing to happen to my youngest brother.[10] He's of normal weight but is surrounded by fat people and I'm afraid he's going to turn fat when he stops growing. I told my Mom about my concerns and how he never eats any vegetables. She said he \"doesn't like\" vegetables as if it was a character flaw of his rather than a reflection of her and Dad's terrible parenting. It's not like any kid is born liking vegetables; the parents have to force it onto them. She said I'm not a parent and have no right to criticize them because they have more life experience than me and then started guilt-tripping me about how painful childbirth was. I pointed out that they are fat and I am not, proving that I have more expertise in this area and that they need to listen to me. She called me \"arrogant\" and \"immature.\"",

Note that she had no plans of revealing this to her parents because they're kinda conservative and it would take a lot of time to convince them. One of her friends(from the girls group) went behind her back and told her parents about this, leading to a huge fight. Things escalated to the point that she hasn't spoken to her parents since.Now recently a girl from that group texted me accusing me of \"taking their friend away from them\". Apparently after that event she stopped hanging out with them and slowly reduced contact.

	"body" : "My partner and I have been dating for about 5 years, and living together for 4. They have been absolutely wonderful; they helped me move cross country to live with them and get out of an abusive household, they drive me everywhere (I am unable to drive due to health issues), and are just generally easy to be with. That was until this last November.For some more context: my partner and I are in a Polyamorous relationship, and things have gotten quite complicated between me and one of their partners (TLDR, they were dating me along with my partner, but then broke up with me about a few years ago). We  have been living at their parents place since 2020, and in November three more people have moved in, and all hell as been breaking loose.Since November, the parents and the other family have been forcing us to do a bunch of tasks. A lot of this my partner has skipped helping, instead choosing to go to my ex’s/their current partners. They have done this several times. When I brought it up, they became snippy and one day yelled at me when I asked if we could leave the house  because I was overwhelmed “you wanted me here to do chores, so that’s what I’m doing”.Things have been rocky between us, and we have had more than one conversation about the future of our relationship.To get to the real meat and bones of this post: we had shared a bank account for a few years, and I trusted them with everything, as they wanted to do all the budget stuff. I never asked about the money, or what percentage was going where. That is until a month or so ago.My partner is in a somewhat expensive hobby. Most of it is cheap, but sometimes it can be…a lot. My partner would tell me about these HUGE orders they would make, and I didn’t think anything of it. Until the parents brought up that we were behind in bills.So, I panicked. I took control of my own bank account and money, and have an app on my phone telling me when there’s activity on my account. I’ll be honest, I thought (and still often wonder if) my partner was using my money on their hobby without asking me.My partner owes the parents a huge chunk of money, and has several lines of credit that need to be paid off due to their hobby. We both have jobs and are in college, so money comes and goes quite a bit.I am only able to work 3 days a week due to my health, so I get a significant less amount of money compared to my partner.This year for taxes and school, I am getting an insane amount of money back. There are many things I want, and this money would cover so much of that.My partner was very quick to shoot down my ideas. They -with the saddest of puppy eyes- said “it would be nice if you could help me pay the parents back…you don’t have to…but….”.I was under the impression that we paying the parents when we were supposed to. My partner has been withholding a lot of information from me, no matter the importance of what it is.Would I be the asshole for not helping my partner out with this huge problem that they caused?",

And don’t get me wrong, my stepmom is a wonderful women who always has made sure I’m safe and healthy. However throughout the years, I’ve felt second best to the step kids. Growing up my dad wasn’t very present in my life, I would go over to his house every so often and hang out, but even then, we would go to his step kids events. Their football games, their marching band performances, their track meets. Sure I didn’t have to many after school activities to attend, but even on the rare occasions I did, he still went to their events. Even at my highschool graduation dinner, I was spoken to twice. They continuously asked my stepbrother what his plans for college were(we are in the same grade, he already had his graduation dinner), got my other stepbrothers favorite dessert(I got what was left when he was done), and played with my stepsisters baby. I tried not to think about it to much and wrote it off as me being to self centered. Then I went to college, and even still, their focus was on my the younger brothers football games, the grandkids, and the other brothers marching bands. They travel hours for them. I asked him at the end of my freshman year to come to a showing of my department where they would show off everything I had been working on this year(bear in mind, I hadn’t asked him for anything this year and this was my first school event where we invite our families). However, he told me that he wouldn’t be able to make it because he was going to my stepbrothers marching band performance that’s 6 hours away(my school is less then 20 minutes from them). Then came my birthday, the last straw. My dad texted me 2 days before and asked if I wanted to go out to eat for my birthday, I said yes and 2 days later, I meet them at the restaurant with my actual brother. When we get there, we put our names on the list and wait for our table to be ready. While we’re waiting, my dad and stepmom put on a football game on their phones because, my stepbrother is at a real game and they might show them on the TV screen. This goes on throughout the entire dinner, where, just like my graduation dinner, I’m spoken to twice(I didn’t even get to finish speaking the second time because my stepbrother showed up on the screen and they flipped out in front of the waiter, claiming, “sorry, we just saw our son on TV” then proceeded to talk about him for the next 45 minutes. Afterwards we gave hugs and left. My brother asked how I enjoyed the dinner and I said I didn’t. Two days later my dad texts me saying I need to communicate that I’m upset and that it’s hard to make everyone happy and that he’s trying his best. I have a fake “it’s ok” speech, but it’s still eating me up hat no matter what, I’m always second best to his new family. AITA",

We only live near my in-laws, who i genuinely love, so I didnt think it be hard to set boundaries. Now with that's said we've come to a disagreement with the new baby on the way.Well last night my MIL sends me a video about the new RSV shot that's being given to pregnant women to help combat RSV for infants. I said on top of getting the shot we had decided that we didn't want anyone kissing our daughter for the first couple months as just another precaution. Now I'll admit my husband had not officially sided with me on this topic yet and I know I was wrong for making it an us thing but at the time I felt it best to try to seem united on it. My MIL then messaged me saying that people are going to kiss her, especially family and there's no way she's going to not kiss her. If she had just said she doesn't understand why I would hold them to that or would like to talk about it and maybe ease my concerns I wouldn't have been so mad off the bat but she told me that I had no choice in how this was going down with my child and it's not the first time she's done this since I got pregnant.My MIL called my husband after I didn't respond to her texts and was then getting into us about how she's raised three boys and that my concerns as a first time mom are just overdramatic and I can't put her in a bubble for about 45 minutes. She said how I'm going to have to just learn to be more comfortable with things that make me uncomfortable and that she was put in her place many of times when she had my husband,her first child. I said this was not something I was willing to budge on and that right now were just going to disagree because I had given my family the same rules about their trip when they come to visit and they all agreed and understood. She did not care.Once off the phone my husband and I ended up in an argument because I was extremely hurt by how she had claimed what I was trying to do was hurtful to her and that if I tried to play games and keep the baby from them I was wrong. He was annoyed because he doesn't see why it's that big of a deal to let them kiss her since they both work from home. I told him if it was just them in the house I would honestly be fine with it but they have his brothers16 and 21 who are both in and out of the house for various reasons. He feels like I'm making an issue with hsi family for no reason. Later we both apologized for getting so mad at each other before I explained my feelings of being disrespected, and said that was where my main issue came in and he just kind of nodded it off.

He usually brushes this off, pretending it doesn’t bother him and joking back, but I know deep down it hurts him.

They then accused me of “turning Jake against them” and ruining a decade long friendship. I tried to ignore this, but after a while I finally retorted back, saying it’s not my fault they treat him so badly. I then got into a heated argument on the phone with them.

All the money will be distributed between our grandkids in our will to hopefully help them get their education paid.My son doesn't have contact with his ex wife or his biological kids, he cut them off and didn't even want to pay child support. My wife and I helped our daughter in law and our grandchildren.To make it clear. What my son is getting from us is some photos and items from his childhood that we keep. It's essentially \"trash\" but we like to look at them every once in a while to remember our kid's childhoods. He isn't getting money or jewelleryI'm getting a lot of comments, sorry if I can't answer all the questions.For those who wonder if the girl could actually be biologically my son's daughter, i don't know and it doesn't make a difference to me or my wife.For those who say that love should be unconditional, I disagree. Love is always conditional to the bare minimum to maintain a bond, that's my opinion.Yes, my son's two biological kids (the kids he had with his first wife) are in the will along with our two other kids' children.Our grandchildren are getting some heirlooms too, the things we're giving to our son aren't things that our other two kids would want.For those who are saying that I would neglect a child adopted by my children under different circumstances, no. This is all about the circumstances in which this girl and my son's new wife came into the family. I don't care if she's adopted or biological, it'll be the same for me. The circumstances in which my son cheated (which is bad enough) and proceeded to kick his family out and abandon them are the reason why neither my wife, me or the rest of our family has a good relationship with the three of them.My two other kids agree with us and aren't close to their brother either.",

Not only does it keep us from making several grocery trips throughout the week, but it helps us stay within our budget.Today I hit up three stores: Sam’s Club, Walmart, and Aldi. I came home and unpacked everything myself. Towards the end of the day, my wife hits me with, “We’re out of dog food.”She asks me to run out and grab some. Thoroughly exhausted, I tell her that I can get some tomorrow. She says that we need some now, but she doesn’t want to go out either. I suggest borrowing some from our neighbors, but she doesn’t like their type of food.Again, I told her that I really don’t want to go out to the store, seeing as I spent almost 3 hours today shopping. She flips out and stomps off, asking aloud why it’s such a big deal for me to go out and get one thing. It’s looking like I’m sleeping alone tonight.For the record, I do 99% of our grocery shopping because going to all of those stores stresses her out. I personally think that the LEAST she can do is go to ONE store and buy ONE item. AITA?",

On one od our aniversaries she made me watch at her dancing class. I was forced to sit next to her ex and since the relationship wasn’t that long and she was constantly talking about it I felt pretty down at the moment. She saw me and came to comfort me, but left after a minute, becouse she had to go to her friends Bday party. Later, when we were in dancing class together, there was this event when our parents were welcomed to watch us. She made me super hyped about it and 2 weeks before said, that this singer was around having a concert, and she gave a promise to her friend to go there with her. I broke down in her eyes saying she is stealing a special moment for me, becouse I was really exited to go (It was basically a ball, where I was hoping to show my parents what I have learned). She saw me brake down and cry. Yet she said that it is more important to her and called me manipulativeNow in my country students organise a ball when they are about to undergo the gradiation exams. She promised to go with me at ball of my former classmates. Yesterday she called me to cancel plans again becouse her friend was again more important than me. We got into heared argument.She stated that she just simply don’t wanna go anymore and I promised to go the with her. When I told her she didn’t give me a date and I could’n have possibly know those 2 event clash with each other, she said that she is sorry, but unfortunately she doesn’t care. I said that I am still going with my friends (male and female) and don’t really care if it makes her uncomfortable, since most of the time I will be at the table with the girlI reminded her of the fact, that when she called the other day that she can’t go, becouse she got sick, i sold the tickets to the ball I helped to organise and came over to her place and stayed with her.I feel like I can’t relly on her promises and feel like everytime she has to choose between me and one of her friends, I am gonna be the last resort. We are currently planning holiday, but I am unsure that she won’t cancel again.Truly i don’t know who is the asshole here and I am genualy afraid it is me.So Am I the asshole?",

Dena has two best friends, Shana and Samantha who live in different states.Last month Shana asked my wife if she wanted to run a half marathon in Vegas. When Dena brought up going to Vegas I said half-jokingly that I had never been to Vegas and she can't go twice before I had gone once. She asked if I meant it. I said yes. So she was like ok I guess we can work it out. Samantha and Dena's sister ended up going too.I later backed out not wanting to be third wheel to a girl's trip. A few days after I backed out my wife found out Samantha's husband Jim is going and asked if I still want to go. I excitedly agreed.A week later my wife asks me \"Hey you're ok with sharing a room with my sister right?\" I said \"No I'm not ok with sharing a room. Why would we share a room?\" She explained that we would share a room with her sister to help save her and us some money. Apparently Shana was going to share a room with Samantha and Jim. I said \"Every single person going on this trip makes six figures other than your sister. Why would we share a room to save money? Why doesn't Shana share a room with your sister? Why would we give up our privacy to save money?\" My wife was not having it and we faught over it but didn't resolve anything.The more I thought about it the more it upset me. We don't go on enough dates. We've never been away from our kids for more than one night. Why would she feel ok with removing any chance at intimacy during a 4 day trip away from the kids?A week later I asked her thoughts on our Vegas trip. She explained that we wouldn't be spending any time in our room together anyway. Her last girls trip they never spent any time in their rooms. They only used their rooms to crash. This is a girl's trip and Jim coming along meant I would have someone for me but it didn't change that this was a girl's trip. I argued that having our own room and privacy doesn't change the trip at all.  Not sharing a room wouldn't change the dynamics of the trip but it would at least create the opportunity for there to be intimacy between us and that that was important to me. Again she wasn't having any of it. During the argument my wife admitted that she had agreed to share a room before she had even asked me. She said someone had suggested it in their text thread and she replied \"I don't care\".We didn't talk for a couple days after that fight. When we warmed back up to each other she told me that she had told the group we wouldn't be sharing a room any longer.She thinks I am the AH because I forced my will on her. I think she is the AH because she agreed to share a room without consulting me, tried to sell me on why that was ok, and ignored the importance of intimacy in our relationship.AITA",

Her biological parents split up when she was 1 year old and since then she has been between two dysfunctional households until she was 18. She has somehow turned out an amazing human however her parents lack some emotional maturity.Without going over the many ups and downs over the course of their life, ill focus on our wedding where this started.- He said he  'didn't feel welcome' at the wedding despite us hand delivering a wedding invitation over a homemade meal. We didn't speak for 2 months over this. Finally he booked his flights to come- He decided to fly into our wedding 6pm the night before. Being too busy doing final wedding organization, we asked him to take a 30minute taxi from the airport but later we could catch up for a beer - he never replied to my calls/text for that beer- The next morning I see my wife-to-be crying before our pre-wedding breakfast because the father-in-law was complaining about not being collected from the airport. I intervened and settled the situation down, but warned him to behave at his daughters wedding.- After the wedding I expected a sign from him that we could talk about these disagreements, however after 6 months passed with no sign of him reaching out, I decide to call him and express my disappointment with his behavior. This started an argument blaming me for being upset that did not conclude to any resolution. I reached out 2 more times, each time the conversations had the same outcome- He has not tried to contact me once in year, and the few times he has contacted my wife it was a similar disagreement ending in a fight.- Hurtful comments he stated were \"you're not welcome in the family', 'its my (husbands) problem that I'm upset', 'i close the book on the relationship with you (husband)'.We are now expecting our first kid in under a month and we want our son to have a grandpa. I feel like introducing him to the grandchild gives into his behaviour where he feels he won this argument (he is an ex-marine everything is about war)We are in this weird stalemate where we cant come to any sort of agreement/functional relationship. He continues to ignore us. The fact this issue escalated over a taxi ride bewilders me.AITA?TLDR: Father-in-law was acting poorly at our wedding over a year ago, he didn't take responsibility for his actions now we are having a kid and I don't have the urge to introduce our son to him.",

Flash forward to a bridesmaid dress appointment with just his sister, she told me that they were planning on having another baby soon. I was so excited for her but then I asked when they were planning on trying. She told me that they were going to shoot for november (9 months from my wedding). I had asked if they do what was there plan if they are due relatively around our wedding. She replied with well I went into labor early last time so it will be fine.  I had brought it up to my fiance because to me that was not only a weird place to bring it up but also weird to plan to try 9 months from your brothers wedding. Side note his sister got married about 4 years ago on his birthday. So when I brought it up all he said to me was I just want 1 day. We had a really long talk on the what ifs. We went and talked to then about how we would really love to have both of them in the wedding and how we arnt telling them not to have children but if you could not be due around our wedding so we don't have to ask one to step out. After a long talk we were all in agreement. Now it's November and we get a text baby #2 is on the way. And she is due 3 weeks before our wedding. We both just feel like we are stuck between a rock and a hard place. They told us that there is family there they can watch the kids during the ceremony, but we didn't invite them to be their personal baby sitters.

My dad has lived with me before I ever even had kids and decided to move into our house when my fiancé and I moved 6 years ago. Now, preface to say, I know it’s not my dad’s responsibility to take care of my kids but this incident last night, I just feel like he could have done something to help out.I was in the living room with my 1 year old changing her diaper, my dad was in the kitchen standing next to my 5 year old. My son knocked over a whole cup of water all over the counter. I’m talking the entire counter was covered in water. Instead of doing literally anything, my dad’s just standing there. I ask him if he’s going to clean it up and he tells me he doesn’t know where any of the towels are and was going to have my son clean it up. Again, my dad has lived in the house as long as we have and the towels have never moved. They’ve always been in the same place. There’s also a brand new roll of paper towels sitting on the counter to the left of him. And my son is 5. I don’t trust him to clean up the entire thing.So I tell him to forget it and I’ll clean it up once I’m done changing hineys. I’m sooooo irritated at this point.

	"body" : "To be clear this happened over a year ago, but my aunt and my grandma are still not talking to me, which makes me think maybe I am the asshole here.My aunt was turning 60 and asked to have her birthday dinner at an expensive steakhouse. Nobody in my family is rich besides my dad and grandpa, neither of which were able to make it, but I still went, as well as my grandma, my cousin, my brother, and our significant others. My grandma was the only person who brought a present as joining my aunt for this expensive dinner was all we budgeted for her birthday.Throughout the meal, my grandma was checking out all the prices and ordered the cheapest options, meanwhile my aunt ordered the most expensive steak, asked for an added lobster tail ($50 itself) and ordered a dessert and a second meal to go. Essentially, she was set to eat for the week when it came to box up leftovers. She also ordered an alcoholic beverage even though she can’t medically drink alcohol, but took a few sips.When the check came, my grandma was in the bathroom. The server asked how to divide it and my aunt said to put her food on my grandma’s tab. She snickered and I guess the rest of us thought she was just playing a prank. But when my grandma got back and got her bill, she just about had a heart attack before she realized what happened, and told my aunt that she couldn’t afford it (for context, my grandma recently had to sell her house and get a job out of retirement because she is literally broke). My aunt argued, saying things like “Well don’t you have a credit card”, “If I was one of your dogs you would”, and “Well Dad would pay for it if he was here” (again, my grandpa is rich and definitely could afford it). My grandma just kept insisting she couldn’t afford it, getting more and more sad and ashamed.Finally I just put my credit card on the table and said “I’ll pay for it. Just shut up.” She then argued that I am her nephew and shouldn’t have to pay for her meal, but that her mom should because it’s her birthday. This also got my grandma to offer to put all the cash she had ($100) for the bill and my aunt payed the rest (over $150). My aunt further made comments that “She paid for her own birthday dinner” and how sad that was. My grandma’s food was $30 max. So she still paid for a significant portion.After that, my husband and I got the heck out of there. We hugged everyone except my aunt, and just left. I let my cousin know that we were no longer talking to her mom for now and didn’t invite her to either of our birthday celebrations. When my grandma found out she was pissed, as was my aunt who found out from my grandma.Since it has been almost two years, I have texted my grandma and aunt on their birthdays and holidays to no response.

	"title" : "AITA for Asking FIL to Tell Us When He is Coming Over",
	"body" : "Alright Reddit, so I (32m) just had this argument with my wife (31f), the relevant backstory is that my FIL just got back from over 6 months out of town. Before he left he parked his van at our house, and now that he’s back he is wanting to come get it. He NEVER tells us when he’s coming over, always just pops by. It’s frustrating because he often interrupts our plans for the day and now that we have a baby (0m), its rare that we are just chilling at home with nothing to do, we are pretty much always doing something.So FIL calls my wife, she misses the call and goes “he’s probably calling to figure out when he can pick the van up” so we discuss and decide that we will walk the dog then go pick him up to get his van. Literally 5 minutes after calling (he lives 20 minutes away) he is knocking on the door. I was annoyed because we were trying to do other stuff. When he comes in I say hi, then go “man it’s a good thing we were here, you gotta give us more of a heads up when you’re coming over” he says “well I tried calling but she didn’t answer” and I said “yea you were already on your way though right? What about letting us know before you’re on your way” the whole exchange it was pretty clear he didn’t think he did anything wrong and he didn’t seem offended by my comment. We got the van sorted and (I thought) everything was fine.Now wife is PISSED at me because she says my “jab” was too direct. She says it was her first time seeing her dad in 6 months and I basically said “why tf are you here.” I just know my wife isn’t ever going to say anything, so even though I don’t think he will ever respect boundaries, I think someone still needs to communicate the boundaries with him. I told her that her lack of communication with her dad is going to blow up in our faces eventually, and I’m just trying to protect us from that. He loves just stopping by and my wife doesn’t wanna tell him that his ex wife (messy divorce) is our babysitter for the time being and says if he comes over while she’s here then oh well. But that’s still going to be my wife’s problem when it happens, and she isn’t going to be thinking “oh well” when it does. Shouldn’t she at least try to communicate with him before the shit show occurs? You gotta participate in your own rescue right? I realize my comment was direct, but anything less than a direct statement will be ignored, actually even my direct statement was ignored.I know parent relationships are complex, and generally I let her make the calls with her parents and I take lead with mine, but this is going to be a true issue going forward and I really think I’m just trying to nip it in the bud. FWIW, no other parent just comes by without telling us ahead of time.AITA?Edit: I’ll accept I’m TA here. For the record though, yea he’s been gone 6 months but for the other 4.5 years we’ve been living here it is a weekly occurrence. It bothers my wife but she doesn’t say anything, that’s why I thought I should. I’m not on some power trip lol",

My sister enjoys GS and has made multiple friends after being an anti-social, shy kid.I am proud of my sister but have no personal interest in Girl Scouts. My mom on the other hand, for the past year my sister has been doing it, has been distinctly hinting towards me to join GS. I have expressed numerous times that I have zero interest in joining.Her hinting and asking went on for numerous months until (12/13/23) when I was at a Girl Scout event with my sister and my mother asked me. It was like the straw that broke the camels back because I got tired of her hinting and asking. I finally joined Girl Scouts.I found out since I joined GS at my sister's troop's event I got put into her troop. I'm in an elementary school troop with kids that are over 4 years younger than me when I'm about to be in high school. My mom was so excited and wouldn't stop talking about it and would brag to family members that I joined it.A month later I went to my first GS meeting and I wasn't having a very good day already so I was overwhelmed with my school day + finding out I'm in a troop with little kids. I ended up having a mental breakdown at the meeting and my mom told me to sit out and eventually come back into the meeting because it was \"too important to miss\". The entire meeting was the troop leader telling the parents how cookie season was going to go while the kids ran around the room playing for an hour.A couple days ago my mom was cutting out door hangers about cookie season. She kept asking me to make an account on a girl scout website and kept talking and talking about GS and how my sister and I would have to go put the door hangers on around our neighborhood (in winter? be so fr) and I didn't care.When I first joined GS I expressed interest but when she was consistently bugging me I finally told her that I have no interest in GS and only joined because she wouldn't stop bugging me even after I expressed how I felt about it. She began to say how we never bond and since she was doing it with my sister she thought we could bond that way.My sister and mom don't bond over much but GS and my mom and I have tons of shows we watch together. That made me feel like I was taking my sisters thing. So I expressed that to my mom and she got mad at me. Saying I never want to watch those shows anymore and never want anything to do with her and my \"angsty teen shit\" was getting old but anytime I bring up something other than GS we could bond on she says she tired or that's boring or she brushes it off and continues to talk about GS.She's making me stay in GS until the end of the school year and I have to go to meetings and sell cookies.

We go to school a couple hours away from each other now but usually we meet up every week at a restaurant in between us.Dean has been seeing some dude from his college for four months now, Jay (20M) and decided that it was time to introduce us at brunch (both of our schools got canceled). Jay seemed awkward but was holding his own and seemed to be an okay dude. At some point, though, Dean was telling a story about some local arcade he spent way too much money at and I went “This is the start of a gambling addiction, Dove.”Didn’t think anything of it since it’s what I’ve called him for almost a decade, however when Dean left to use the bathroom Jay immediately stared at me telling me not to “hit on his man” while he was sitting right there. I told him that I am very much straight to which he claimed that ‘Dove’ must be to make fun of Dean being gay and I must be homophobic. I told him he was being absurd and asked why I would be here if I was homophobic.Dean then came back to the table and Jay claimed that they should be heading out to get back before the roads got icier. We paid and said goodbye and I was honestly too shell shocked to say anything about it. I was going to wait until Dean got back to campus before telling him any of this but when I texted my brother about this he said that Dove was kinda a weird name and he understood Jay’s pov. AITA?",

	"body" : "For some context I've been apart of the ensemble for almost four years now. This is my senior year of highschool and I'm technically still new to the whole process of being a musician. I started reading music my sophomore year and started off on bells (glockenspiel). My second year I was promoted to center marimba after auditioning for the spot. I've had that spot since then.When getting my music for this competition season I've accumulated 9 1/2 pages of sheet music. I have the most music out of the entire ensemble, including wind players. Also to add, I started playing 4 mallets my junior year with a small feature of permiantations. Compared to last year I have 3 times the amount of 4 mallet playing. Around 60% of my sheet music requires me to play 4 mallets.Our ensemble includes a section of marching winds, percussion section, and mallet section. Our old mallet/percussion tech left us last year and we now have a new percussion tech. He specializes in drumset and drum related activities (bass, snare, tenors etc.). He can't really read treble clef let alone teach 4 mallets. That's left the mallet line with a strong disadvantage when learning music. We don't have someone to guide us, and my director has left it to me to be responsible for the slack of keeping up with the rest of the ensemble.During rehearsals we are split into \"sectionals\" except that my section doesn't have a director. One mallet player has a learning disability that really sets him behind when learning music, and he is overall around 4-5 years younger than me. I'm not a teacher, I'm a student just like the rest of the mallet line/band.Whenever I try to help said student, they just sit there and watch me try to help them. They never actually try to play the music and \"give up\" but they refuse to quit the ensemble. My efforts to help have frustrated me greatly, I dont understand his disability nor was I notified of it (i figured it out myself).I was also never appointed the position of section leader or any other type of leading psoition. I have 9 1/2 page of music to teach myself, AITA for not wanting to help the others in my line ?",

	"body" : "I 21f, am in college and I live on campus in an apartment. At the beginning of the semester, there were four of us, however one of them moved at shortly after the semester started. Fast forward to the start of this semester and we had a new roommate just show up. I, nor my other two roommates, were made aware of a fourth person moving in. She just showed up.She’s been here for 5 days so far and she’s at the top of my list for worst roommates. She started off with wearing her shoes through the apartment (we’re in the Midwest & it’s covered in snow right now) so she’s tracking in snow and salt all over the apartment and embedding dirt and salt into the carpet. She also keeps shutting the bathroom door after she showers and not leaving the fan on, and our bathroom has already been treated for mold this year (campus housing is fantastic). We have asked her to leave the bathroom door open already. She’s been very loud coming in and out of the apartment at all hours and I have been woken up from her being loud in the middle of the night. The last straw, however, was that I woke up for work Saturday morning to find that there was literal feces on my hand towel in the bathroom from her. I know it was her because she was the only one in the bathroom after I was the previous night. Disgusted, I did not have time to address it before I left for work. When I came home from work, I found that another feces stain was now on the paper towel roll in the kitchen.I made my 2 other roommates aware of this and they agreed that it was disgusting and that we needed to sit her down and discuss with her. Tonight, I got back from classes, only to find that there’s trash on the floor, literally 4 steps away from the trash can. She couldn’t bother to take the extra 4 steps to throw the trash in the correct spot. I’m at my wits end. I made a list of everything that has happened and previous agreements for apartment rules that we had agreed upon prior to her arrival. When presented to her, she stated that I, specifically, am being standoffish towards her and that she does not appreciate it.AITA for addressing these issues and trying to remedy the situation?",

He’s more than 10 years older than me and living in this room for about a year or so. The building I live in have rules like no smoking and no drinking but when I moved in I noticed that Z smokes and drinks as well. He organises parties as well (party might be an overkill, he basically invites his 2-4 friends and drinks till late). I am a non-smoker and a light sleeper. So his late night parties bother me a little as I wake up early for gym. I endured it for few days out of courtesy but after this happening regularly I raised my concerns about smoking and the late night drinking. he was really chill about it and changed those things, he started smoking out in the balcony and reduced the frequency and timings of his party.Somedays he comes late (mostly after I fell asleep). Today he came after I fell asleep and maybe he had a call from home, he was talking loudly and without earplugs. It woke me up, I waited till he ended his call and asked him to wear earplugs next time he’s on a call.He started arguing with me and told me that I should move out and get my own place. That I am always nagging him about things, I don’t compromise etc. I asked him if he wanted me to change something about how I stayed there, he replied he didn’t have problems with me but as I had problems with him, I should move out. He flat out declared he won’t wear earplugs and he doesn’t like that and he won’t change his ways.His friend who was present to witness this all took Z out. After a while he came back and talked politely with me, still telling me not to ask him to wear earplugs. Anyways the argument ended with a disagreement.AITA for asking him to wear earplugs?

	"body" : "TL;DR DOWN BELOW!So I (m21) and my girlfriend (f19) have been together for about 4 months now. At the start I vaped, smoked cigarettes occasionally, mixed weed with tobacco. All just like she does. However, something started snapping in me when I lost my vape I think 2 months ago. I seriously thought it was stolen. I surprisingly said to myself: \"I guess that's that\". Well it turned out I just forgot it at home. But this marked the beginning of my journey towards quitting.As of writing this, i am almost 5 days vape free. And 3 days nicotine free (little tobacco in a joint). It's probably the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.My girlfriend is not considering quitting at all. She tries to support me by vaping less nicotine, and not doing it in my sight. However: she takes her vape whenever she goes to the bathroom. And that triggers something in me whenever I see it. On one hand it kinda makes me upset that she doesn't have the same opinions about it as me. But on the other hand my cravings get worse. Even though I despise nicotine, it's still one of the most addictive chemicals known to exist. And I've been using nicotine for about 6 years.This morning something happened. I had some of the worst cravings ever. My girlfriend knew I was craving and tried to support me. But then she went to the bathroom with her vape. Something snapped in me. Eventually she came back. Turned out the toilet was occupied but she vaped in the kitchen. Then she went to the bathroom again with her vape. I swear I was on the edge of crying that's how bad it was.I eventually did say something about it and she understood that that was dumb of her. Especially when my study is extremely busy at the moment. And I really don't have time for stupid nicotine shit like that.Now here's the dilemma: I have a proper week of heavy schoolwork left. And I want to have full focus on that. And I can't let nicotine cravings take over so I want my environment to be as clean from nicotine as possible. However I can't tell anyone what they can and cannot do. So WIBTA if I ask my girlfriend to not vape AT ALL when I'm at hers or she's at mine. And if she can't commit to that, I won't be around her as much until my schoolwork is done, or until my cravings have properly started to leave my system.TL;DR I fully quit nicotine for 5 days now while being extremely busy with school. My girlfriend still vapes out of my sight/on her bathroom and she smokes occasionally while drinking. which makes me upset and it makes me crave it more. WIBTA if I asked her to not vape/smoke around me at all until I'm done with school this week or until my cravings are gone, or otherwise I won't be able to be around her as much until then?",

	"title" : "AITA for expecting my roommate to help cleanup after a party at our apartment?",
	"body" : "CONTEXT: My roommate (Sam) and I both go to the same University and are doing the same major (Computer Engineering). Ever since Sam moved in with me a few months ago, I have tried to include him with my friend group as much as possible. They got along very well and I would say Sam is now part of the core friend group.EVENT: The other day, I had a party/potluck at our townhome apartment. It was a fairly large function (12 people total), all of whom Sam knows and is friends with. I cooked food for everyone, and some of the friends brought stuff to cook also. Sam was having a good time and definitely engaged in the function. Overall successful function, but because of the cooking the kitchen was pretty dirty.ISSUE: The day afterwards, I woke up and started cleaning up the mess from the party. I saw my roommate Sam and asked him to help clean the apartment. I had already taken care of all of the dishes and cups, i just wanted help cleaning the tables and putting away the cleaned dishes. My roommate said that he would help, but was upset that he felt like I \"expected\" him to help clean. He said, since it was my party, it is my responsibility to clean and I shouldn't \"expect\" him to help clean.That really upset me, but i tried to stay civil and explain my side of it. He engaged with the event, ate food, I even made him a bowl of spaghetti. Sam agreed to clean reluctantly, but didn't feel like I should \"expect\" that out of him. Like how you wouldn't expect one of the guests to help clean. Ultimately, he cleaned for maybe 5 minutes max while we argued, and I did the lions share (95%) of the cleaning.Another thing that he was upset about was that I didn't ask him for permission to have the party/potluck. I assumed he would be okay with it. I didn't feel the need to ask him permission since I invited him to the event (of course) and our friend group is basically the same. We have had events like this in the past and it seems like he enjoys and engages with them.TLDR: Had a party at my place. Invited the friend group (which my roommate Sam is a part of). Sam engaged with the party and had a good time. Asked Sam of help clean afterwards. He doesn't feel like I should \"expect\" him to clean since it was my party.AITA???",

	"title" : "WIBTA for choosing DnD over a birthday party, even after committing to both?",
	"body" : "I’ve been a part of a DnD group that plays through a discord server for the last few years. We had a main campaign that ran roughly two years, took a break for one shots/mini games for ~a year and are now about to return back to our main campaign which is a pretty big deal. All members had agreed on a date for the first session back months ago.My dilemma: A close friend of mine’s birthday is coming up and due to everyone’s work schedule, the only day she can have her birthday party is the same night as the return campaign. I’ve been assigned to drive bday girl, and two other friends B and C, and the reservation for the 8(?) people going to dinner has been set. B and C know that I have the DnD commitment and have told me that I should just tell the DM that I’m missing the session, that a birthday party is more important and the bday girl really wants me there.My DM also knows about the birthday party and while he understands stuff comes up, is pretty upset that I’m considering bailing on the game (he works really hard on the sessions and they usually run pretty long). He says I need to be there for at least 3 hours or it’s not fair to the other players, or not at all for the first session. The game starts at 6pm (would run until 11pm/12am since it’s a long one for the return) and the party dinner is at 7:30pm. With drive time to pick people up, the dinner, and taking people home I would miss 90% of the game anyways meaning it’s all or nothing. I know missing one game isn’t the end of the world but it’s such an important session setting up for the rest our games moving forward, and I don’t want to put a chip on the DMs shoulder (I had to leave our last long running campaign a few years ago due to scheduling conflicts so I think he’s afraid I’m doing it again which I’m not).For additional context: All the birthday party people can drive, so they could still carpool together if I bailed out so it’s not like I’m leaving anyone stranded. Also, the DnD people I haven’t met in person but they’re a state away and friends with someone I’m friends with IRL and we’ve played together for years so I feel like I have a more personal connection than just online friends. I committed to the game session first but an irl bday party seems more detrimental to miss.I’m a homebody and an introvert so my preference is always staying home and playing a game which is why I’m considering DnD and potentially just setting up that I’m getting sick to miss the party so the bday girl doesn’t find out why I wouldn’t be going, but that also seems like setting myself up for failure because I would hate to lie and B and C might be suspicious anyways since they already know I had another commitment. Both are this weekend (so I have one full week), what should I do?TL;DR: WIBTA if I bailed on a recently scheduled birthday party to play DnD instead since I committed to the game months ago?",

Grace and I have been friends for about 3-4 years. We met in university and have been good friends since. Even in university I kinda noticed that she wants to “befriend” all my close friends and make them her best friends. Okay whatever we can all hangout together. But she’ll go above and beyond kinda behind my back to make them her best friend. I have another childhood best friend that I’ve known for about 15 years, every time I talk about her Grace jumps in and says “omg introduce me to her she sounds so fun”. I tried to introduce them together but my childhood friend was not a big fan of Grace so that never happened. I also recently made some friends from my yoga class, and ONCE again Grace mentions one specific friend from my yoga class and talks about her nonstop, how she thinks she’s so stylish. I recently found out that she’s followed her on ig. She also “stole” one of my close guy friend from middle school and now they’re besties, and now flirts with everyone who’s in that guy group.These are just some of the patterns I noticed as far as it goes for my friends. I can overlook most of them because I don’t OWN any friendships- I get that Im not a child. But this one really bothers me a lot. I broke up with my ex about a year ago. I obviously introduced Grace to my ex back when we were dating because we were good friends. So we would hangout together a lot and even have couple people that I’ve mentioned above as a group. Friend group overlaps, its a good thing that we all got along so well. Here’s the thing. We broke up, and now my ex and my best friend hangout all the time. Although my ex and I are in great terms and are planning on being civil with each other since our friend group overlaps a bit. Grace, my ex, my ex’s friends are now a big group who does everything together. For those wondering if they’re seeing each other they’re not. Grace has even dated one of my ex’s friends for a bit. This whole thing is weird, right? Grace now acts like she’s replaced me in every way possible. She even started going to my ex’s volunteering group (an animal society) that I used to also volunteer at back when I was dating my ex, and doesn’t stop talking about how everyone at the society thinks her and my ex are dating and shes tired of correcting people.I know people have their own ideas of “stealing friends” but really AITA for thinking this way?

	"title" : "AITA for Managing a Friend's Game Account Without Clear Communication? Looking for Opinions on Responsibility in Recent Misunderstanding.",
	"body" : "A few months ago in the game, Genshin Impact, before I volunteered to manage my friend Tristy's account, I was already taking care of Ann's, and another friend's. I handle activities like spending resin, daily tasks, and limited-time events. Tristy, busy with school, agreed to me using her resin. Recently, she had more time for the game. We never discussed how I should handle her quests. I also informed her about managing limited-time events, to which she agreed.Here's where the situation arises. To access these limited-time events, you would need to complete your quests. She has played this game for quite a while and I believe she should know this step of the process but am confused as to why she didn't communicate her preferences. When she was active, she confronted me about missing quests to which I stated that it was essential to gain access and complete her events. She then went on to explain how she played the game for the quest and that I had ruined her experience. In hindsight, I shouldn't have apologized right away as I believe it only reaffirmed my guilt from her perspective without at least trying to explain or defend my actions from my position. It only showed my actions without my intentions. I then bought something for her and sent it to her account to try to compensate for the damage I caused. She thanked me but didn't like it, stating that she wished to remain free to play and not to do it next time. She threatened me with two ultimatums of revoking access to her account if I didn't follow her new set of demands, \"Just ask if you can do things on my account Like if you can use resin Or if there's an event then tell me and I'll see if I can do the requirements If not then I'll just take my account back And if someone goes wrong then I'm taking my account back :)\"After profusely apologizing, I invited her to discuss it with a mutual friend, Ann, whom we are on good terms with, \"Hey Tristy, I've been thinking about our recent discussions. To ensure we're on the same page and resolve any concerns, would you be open to a conversation with Ann as a neutral third party? Let me know a time that works for you. Thanks\" She read my message two days later and the next morning, no response. I noticed that my access had been revoked across all devices. At this point, I care not for access to her account but for trying to salvage what remains of friendship through communication. In the game, I sent her a message explaining the lack of communication on both sides. No response. I ended the message with goodbye. Out of fairness, I encouraged Ann to ask for her side as well but Ann refused, worrying she may make Tristy uncomfortable by reminding her.Would I be wrong for assuming she would know quests have to be completed to access the events since she has played the game for quite a while and was aware I am taking care of events?

	"body" : "I (16) had some medical and psychiatric issues around 2 years ago and had to go into inpatient treatment. My dad found this extremely stressful and said that he couldn’t handle work anymore, so he took a leave of absence. Cut to around 6 months later, i had been in and out of inpatient treatment but i was back home at the time. My dad’s job said that if he took anymore leave then they would have to let him go as they could not reserve the position anymore. He continued to stay home, so he was let go. He hasnt gotten a job since then. For some context, he had a REALLY good job so we have not struggled financially since then. however, for years i have noticed that he doesn’t seem very happy at home. He sleeps a lot and spends a lot of time on the computer or doing solitary things. He is always searching for something new to keep him occupied-hes tried wood working, metal working, etc. but gets bored really quick and gets upset because he doesn’t have anything to do. I am very concerned about his mental health. On top of that, i feel as if i cannot count on him to get a job when the time comes that our money runs out and he needs to return to work. Several times in the past hes promised to get a job within the next 6 months or whatever but breaks it every time. I decided for these reasons to send him a text explaining how i feel. I told him that i think hes depressed and that getting a job would benefit him and the family. My dad responded very harshly. He emphasized that we had plenty of money and that he will get a job when he “feels ready”. I told him that while it is true that getting a job isn’t an urgent matter ATM, i don’t feel like i can trust him when he says he will get a job when the time comes. He asked me why and so i told him. Ive felt like i can’t rely on him my whole life. He would leave me when i was very young to be unsupervised and to “fend for myself” (i was 4-6) to make my own food when i wasnt even tall enough to reach the counter. I cant remember a time where he took me to a doctor’s appointment or took me to buy clothes or school supplies. He has promised to stop yelling and insulting over and over throughout the past decade but has never kept it up. The argument escalated from here and he proceeded to call me names and say i was viciously attacking him. He told me all my concerns were wrong and that i was imagining things and that i was being a jerk. He said that i was calling him a shitty father (i never said anything close). Farther into the argument, i settled by saying i would feel much better if he just gave me a plan on when he will get a job (i.e “i will get a job in 2025” or whatever) but he said no, that i was strill attacking him, and that it was none of my business. I tried to tell him it would remove a lot of anxiety and resentment in me if i could feel comfortable that he will get a job when he needs to. He still said no but eventually we both got tired and stopped arguing (it had been like 2 days of this). But since the argument subsided he has repeadedly said that i “hurt him beyond repair” and “destroyed his self esteem”. I never wanted to hurt him, i just want him and the family to be happy and supported. I honestly have accepted that i won’t get that plan i wanted, but my dad keeps bringing up how awful i treated him and how i destroyed him and that apparently “hate him” (i love him so much) i could be the asshole for giving the feedback so so-called harshly (?). Am i the asshole for asking my dad to get a job/give me plan of when and saying he doesnt have a hsitory of being reliable?edit: to clarify, im aware that it may have not been within my bounds to ask for a plan, but i accepted the no he gave me about the plan and the job. i apologized for that aspect. but why i made this post is because im wondering if i was an asshole for doing so. it made me very sad whenever i saw him depressed and he said it himself that he doesnt have enough of a social life and he would be happier with something to do.",

But the worst part is that, this hill, at the end of the winter, offers a great price for a full year pass. It allows you to ski for the rest of the end of the winter, it allows you to visit the hill all through summer, and all through the next winter, all on that one pass. Now this would be great, except that I had never gone on that hill before, so I was worried I wouldn't like it. I told me parents not to buy it before I go there at least once, but I wasn't able to go before it was either we buy one or we don't. My parents ended up getting me one before I knew if I liked the hill, but after I went there once with the pass, I knew I didn't like the hill. I much preferred the hill we use to always go to.

Essentially telling me that if I’d leave he’d have a heart attack because he’d become nervous.I feel really bad because even though I’m angry at him and super cold because I’m outside at 2C degree, I don’t want anything to happen to him. AITA?TL:DR : had an argument with dad, left home. Dad has had a heart attack and he should not be agitated. AITA?",

Over the summer my bf (M19) asked me to spend the night and I agreed, at the time I was pet sitting.I discussed with the owner of the pups and we agreed that I would hang out during the day and leave at night for a lower pay (it was originally $100 for the weekend and we lowered it to $75). The pups owner and my dad are friends, and he said he would tell my dad our new arrangement. That was at the beginning of last summer.After I returned home after the weekend, my dad said he had no idea that I was changing the plans. So him and my stepmom decided it would be a good idea to put a tracker on all 3 of our phones, and at the time I agreed. My college isn't in a very good town, and I'm the only one of my siblings to go to college so I understand their worry for me.But here is my issue, my dad gets notifications for EVERYTHING. Whenever I drive for more than a mile, notification. Whenever I arrive to a set location, notification. If I'm speeding, notification. I get texts from him all the time asking where I'm going, what I'm doing, who I'm with. It's driving me nuts.I take edibles to help me sleep at night, I ran out like 2 months into school and haven't been able to get back to the shop I know will sell to me. I worry that he will question me going up there and I don't want to tell him why, my parents used to smoke when they were still married and made it very clear that they didn't want us kids doing it.I feel I have more than proved myself that I am safe and responsible as a college student, plus if you don't know, Life360 went through a huge scandal for selling personal information to people. I turn 19 in March, and I'm spending this summer with my mom in another state.I want to be able to do college things, I want to go smoke weed, I want to go to parties out of town, I want to do things without someone breathing down my back 24/7. I want to talk to him about it, but I don't know how.How do I bring it up to him? And would I be in the wrong for bringing it up and asking to get rid of it?",

Refused to commit, said he didn’t trust me, so i backed off and told him to go figure his shit out. His behavior was so hot and cold all year. Well i haven’t seen him in 4 months, our last convo, he still wasn’t ready for a commitment. My ex sent 2 candles worth 700$. He’s 39, I’m 33. He said some of the most cruel things to me the last time we spoke, it’s been 3 months. He told me every little thing I’ve done this year is a red flag. Despite him not telling me what his plans are, lying to me, he expected me to be devoted to him, and to be an angel this year, to win him back. He’s called me a narcissist, he’s questioned whether I’m too old to become another at this point in my life, he says things then denies doing them… he’s made me question my reality. Essentially I’m over him, and would never get back together after the things he said. I guess I’m just over his 39yo shenanigans! Who sends 700 dollar candles to somebody they described as a walking talking red flag?!i ended up sending the candles back. I put them in a box with the shit he left at my house over the course of the year. He lives with his mom and dad, in their basement. His family likely has no idea that he was still talking to me. So i put the candles in a box with his clothes, and wrote on the box “here’s everything you left at my house this year as well as the candles you just sent me. Gifts without an intent or emotion behind them, are pointless.” He messaged me and said “i can’t say I’m not shocked that you would send a box like this to my house. What good did you think would come from this.” Idk why he response makes me so mad. The fact that he doesn’t realize how manipulative his behavior has been is mind boggling.They’re Thompson Ferrier Candles, btw. I know everyone’s going to ask. He sent my mom a candle last year too. When i asked why he would send my mom a gift, he said he was just wanting to do something nice. Completely didn’t understand how that would mess with my moms emotions and make my parents feel like he wanted to have more of a relationship with themSo am i the asshole for sending the candles back the way i did? I feel like i might be the asshole because i chose not to let it go.TLDR; i sent my ex his gifts back, am i the assjole for sending it back the way i did?",

He used this jeep for his traveling job AND his new construction business so he traveled a lot and for sure took tolls roads since June 2022 till July 2023 when I took over the Jeep as we broke up and I moved out.he has NEVER paid a toll road bill for this carbecause he never paid one he racked up over $572 worth of charges on the toll roads back in July and never paid it thus leading to more late chargeswe just recently learned anytime I used to a toll road it got sent to him instead of me because he is the main name on the loan. I had no idea how much I owed to them and that it wasn’t getting paid.if you add up what I actually did on the toll roads from July until today it’s only $85 without any late feesbecause he never paid it added another $440 worth of late fees, civil penalties, etc to where it’s now he can’t register any vehiclehe never ever checks his mail so that’s why we are just now finding out about thisBecause of this he wants me to Pay like $350-$400 of this bill but I don’t think thats fair at all. Am in the right to not wanting to pay that much?To add to this this relationship did not end amicably. He was very emotionally abusive to me and said things that I still struggle with today. When we were in a relationship I helped him finically all of the time (I’m talking maxed out credit cards in my name, gave him money when he didn’t have a job at one point, got into serious debt for a while, etc).

Being part of a large family I had 9 siblings involved in the wedding. Her two sisters as the remaining bridesmaids.  I planned her bachelorette party and paid over 2k for it. We went on the trip and I paid for anything she wanted. Once we were back E began ignoring me. I confronted E on three different occasions asking what I had done to upset her and to apologize.  E said if I didn’t know what I had done to upset her then I wasn’t sorry for it and wouldn’t accept my apology. I approached E’s sister and asked her what I had done to upset E.  Her sister said she didn’t know what it was and that she was probably stressed. The treatment continued and I finally told E that I wanted to withdrawal from the wedding and work on our friendship and that if she was willing I wanted to be a bridesmaid but until then I didn’t feel right being a bridesmaid with the current issues. E agreed and told me she would work on our relationship. After that conversation things were better. After that my sister and I were getting our bridesmaid dresses altered. They needed major alterations and extra material was needed. I told E to order an extra bridesmaid dress and that I would pay for it so we could use it as material. E said the dresses were discontinued and that we would use the hem scraps to alter them. My dress was being altered at a shop and my sisters by a family friend. My sister ended up needing a lot of material for her alterations and didn’t have any scraps. I asked E if she could get scraps from the alteration shop for us to use. My brother picked up my dress and was supposed to get the scrap material. He came home and my dress had been unaltered and no scraps had been brought home for my sister. When asked why my dress was unaltered he said there were no leftover hem scraps and that E said to cut up my dress to use the material for my sister and to use the remaining material for a new bridesmaid. I asked E why I was no longer in the wedding since we had an agreement that I would be since our relationship was better. E said she didn’t think I wanted to be in the wedding and told the shop to not alter my dress. My dad told E that if I wasn’t in the wedding our family wouldn’t attend. Once E realized we were serious she asked me to be in the wedding. We scrambled to get my dress altered and to find material for my sisters dress.

She ignored my question, and didn’t hang up until about 10:10pm.Then she turned to me and snarled: “Just so you know, that really pissed me off!”I was totally startled. I asked her what she was mad about. She said she was angry that I interrupted her phone conversation, she said she misses her family and I was being rude to interrupt. I told her I apologize for interrupting, but I didn’t mean to be rude, I just wanted to turn off a light. She didn’t stop being angry with me.I just don’t think what I did was rude, but she was adamant.

We would try and find out what topics she liked so that we could talk about those with her so she could be included too but she would not tell us as she would say that we wouldn’t find the same things interesting despite us insisting we would like to know. I only found out that she liked similar things to me when I had already left for a different school through posts she liked on instagram. I openly talked about these interests within a smaller group setting so she could have been included in the conversation too.In addition, we had a whatsapp group chat with all of us included and when we would make plans, she would never respond until we mentioned her only for her to immediately respond with no. This happened every single time to the point that in the initial invite messages we would mention her. At first we considered that she had strict parents and tried to make accommodations for her such as meeting up with her at her place and accompanying her out or choosing places close to where she lives, but we found out her younger sister is allowed to go out on sleepovers so we just assumed she doesn’t want to go out and therefore stopped including her in plans during our final year.It wasn’t until the end of year 12 (ages 16/17) that the friends that stayed at the school cut her off. Since then, her posts and reposts on tiktok have been about bad friends. We know that it is about us because we are the only friends she has had — her friend of 10+ years says Emily barely spoke to her or teachers.Emily says she has social anxiety and I understand how difficult it is to talk to other people when you have it but not even involving yourself in text conversations? She has made online friends and talks to them as well as talking to her younger sister’s friends, so are we actually the problem and being insensitive to this?My friends and I want to confront her and talk about it because we got annoyed at her for essentially bad-mouthing us yet she would still ask us to support her hobby accounts and be nice when we do have small interactions, essentially being two-faced.WIBTA?",

My older brother (31m) has been battling addiction since I was very young.A few months ago my parents were out of town and I had agreed to water the plants once a week while their neighbor grabbed their mail daily. One of the times I was there to water the plants I found my brother high in the basement. He had broken in knowing they were out of town and not thinking I would go down to the basement at all. The basement locks from the outside so he was not able to get into the rest of the house.I left after asking him  if I could get him some help and him refusing and called my parents. They made the decision to call the cops and I was put in the position of having to let them into my parents house. He left before they got there and I made sure all the doors and windows were locked, but my mom guilted me into continuing to water the plants the next couple weeks as they would die if no one did. The next time I came back all of the stuff my brother had brought into the basement was gone indicating he was still able to enter the building, and I found one of the windows unlocked again. The time after that the washer was on, so I knew he had come back a third time. My brother ended up telling my parents he knew how to open that window from outside. But my parents wouldn't come home or do anything about the window. My partner ended up watering the plants the rest of the time my parents were gone because my anxiety was so high.Flash forward to the other day, my parents were going to be gone for a long weekend and my mom asked me if I could bring in the mail on my way home from work one day and they'd ask the neighbors to do so the rest of the week. I said no because I still have a lot of trauma from the last time and did not feel comfortable.Meanwhile, my city is going through an extreme weather event and a lot of people are losing power, I asked my mom if my power went out if I could crash at their place, as it is nigh impossible to get anywhere with how much ice there is, and I have a senior cat with serious medical issues, and I do not think he would be safe without heat.My mom said yes, then later expressed how upset she was with me that I wouldn't do something she viewed as super simple and easy, the window has now been fixed so he can't get back in that way, and that she thinks it's clear I can control my anxiety when I need to.I feel like bringing in the mail when someone else can easily get it and finding a warm place to stay during a storm are very different things, but maybe I should have just sucked it up and brought their mail in even though even thinking about it was causing me extreme amounts of anxiety. AITA?Editing to add: The idea of sleeping there does give me a ton of anxiety, and I'm very very grateful the power has not gone out and I have not had to do that.",

MIL's house is pretty small and cramped with that many people in it so it leads to feeling like you're in the way no matter where you stand or sit.A little while later my son asks for a drink so we go to get his cup out of the diaper bag which my husband had packed.  I had distinctly asked him to pack a cup for a son on the way out the door and it hadn't made it into the bag.  I had also checked in on the way out the door and asked if we had everything.  I was kinda peeved not going to lie.  I was like \"Why didn't you pack a cup?\" Of course, he didn't know.  I sighed and we resigned to using this water bottle with a straw in it for seltzer.

It's building pressure from the carbon dioxide being released when the straw is down and you need to put it on with the straw up!\"  He doesn't listen and makes a new puddle.I excuse myself to go to the bathroom.  I come back downstairs and there he is a third time screwing the lid onto the water bottle with the straw down.  I kinda lose it at this point and I'm like \"[Husband's name]! You need to take the lid off, raise the straw AND THEN screw the lid on with the straw UP so that the carbon dioxide doesn't build pressure inside of the water bottle!\"  Yes I said it kind of annoyed because it was literally the third time I had said this same thing.  SIL comes flying around the corner from the kitchen and starts yelling at me \"JUST SO YOU KNOW [Husband's name] YOU'RE NOT STUPID FOR NOT KNOWING THAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT EITHER!\" I immediately apologized, to no avail and it was super awkward. After dinner, BIL, SIL and SILF go upstairs and it's kinda obvious they're talking about me.  We leave.Last week, MIL invited my son and Hub over for dinner (which she never does) and proceeded to interrogate him about our relationship.  Essentially it's clear they think I'm an abusive ass.",

	"body" : "Hi all!I 24f moved into a house about a year ago. The house is in a fairly nice neighborhood, lots of nice people and places around. I really like it here.I had no problem until the summer came around. As one does, I was laying out on a towel listening to music and tanning. I have a fence separating my lawn from my neighbors, but apparently it is not enough. After about a week my neighbor knocked on my door not even asking, but demanding I cover up because her husband was staring at me. I told her that respectfully, she should talk with her husband about this and not me since I have no interest in him. This was an ongoing issue all summer.When I have been out, going to my car, taking my dog out to the backyard etc. and the husband is there he always says hi and sometimes strikes a conversation with me. I always answer him and talk if he wants to.She asked me to stop this, I have not because I think I should be able to say hi to a neighbor of mine, especially if they say it to me first.Recently I heard from a friend who is in a group chat with some other from this place about how I supposedly is a bimbo, they should keep their husbands away from me and that I love attention from married men. This is not true, but now I feel like it would have just been best for me to never answer him because I have noticed how some of the people have started being kind of snarky with me.Was I really an asshole for all this.?",

Followed by how it is her choice and I did not have a say in this and apologized again if I pressured her into giving up on the procedure with silent treatment. Then I listed a long paragraph about how much I love the things she wanted to change and I am there for her to talk about with her insecurities if she wanted to etc.She almost immediatly apologized as well and said how she emphasized with me and how she would feel terrible if I tried to change my appearence and said all these time we spent distant(3 hours) made her realize she didn’t even want it in the beginning and would try to love herself as she is.

We have been living together for about six months now, and were debating renewing our lease at our old place, but we both decided that we should find somewhere else rather than continue to deal with our shitty landlord for low-ish rent. A big thing about our new complex is that it is pet friendly. My roommate and I have discussed getting a dog, and now we finally had that opportunity. About five days ago, we went to a shelter to find a dog, and we met Grizzly, a young lab who was recently surrendered. We immediately fell in love with him, and adopted him on the spot. Grizzly has spent the last few days acclimating to our apartment, and he's really fitting in.This is where the trouble starts. My roommate joined the apartment complex's Facebook group, and posted about adopting Grizzly. We then got a knock on our door about an hour after the post goes up, and it is a woman who is maybe in her late 30s. She tells us that Grizzly was actually her families dog, and they had surrendered him to the shelter because \"their daughter was misbehaving\", and now they wanted him back after they decided that she \"deserved him again\", and that they were \"so grateful that a nice girl kept him safe for her daughter\". My first reaction was to tell her no, and she got pretty pissed. About ten minutes after she left when I told her no, her husband and her both came to the door to yell my roommate for \"kidnapping their dog\". Eventually neighbors heard the commotion and things got awkward for everyone involved, but now they are relentlessly spamming the Facebook page about the \"dog thieves that live upstairs\".I don't feel bad at all for the parents. They seem like total assholes, but I do feel bad for their daughter. We haven't had Grizzly long, and I already feel attached, but I don't want for that little girl to see her dog loving someone else. Part of me wants to give him back for her sake, but the other worries for his safety with that family. My roommate is just as conflicted, and we aren't sure if we're the assholes for taking this girls dog away from her, even if her parents are trash bags. What do you guys think? AITA?",

Except he does all night barely sleeping a few hours and ignoring me all evening and my 2 yr old daughter who’s only known him as daddy.It took a while doc appt ultrasound doc again, and I waited for him to come back and pick me up. After an hour I tried calling but he was gaming online and phone line was busy. I couldn’t call his cell phone because basic base phone only allowed call for base phone numbers. I waited another hour. The nurses got worried for me inflet self consciousness and moved down by the exit. Another hour passed.At this point been there five hours. Three of them waiting for him. The nurses near this clinic asked if i was okay. I said I was waiting on huby he had the car ten more minutes then I decided to walk.It was 2 maybe 3 miles home. Outside was 110 degrees, I had trouble walking it was awkward. It took 30 minutes to cross the parking lot. I was out of breath. I crossed the street and stop in the shade of seedling tree barely any shade but i needed it. Ten minutes later I barely made any progress I was dripping in sweat.My dress is almost see through because of the sweat. A few men stopped offered a ride. I was scared said no. 20 minutes later I barely made any progress. I was trying so hard  to not cry. I was in so much pain. Hotter than hell and about to pass out. A women pulled over offered a ride i waved her off she asked how far I had to go and when I told  her dark skin paled.

I knew the dangers off taking a tide with strangers. Hell that lady summer news was a military wife offering another lady who was pregnant a ride and she was kidnapped cut open left to die while her newly premature baby was kidnapped.

And that they spend it stupidly, which they sometimes do, but it’s their money.I don’t really do thatMy dad decided to move six hours away to an isolated location, and purchased my sister a property for hundreds of thousands of dollars to convince her to come. With the impression she would live there. She INSISTED it be put in her name. He offered me the same opportunity, but I knew I would never want to live there in a million years and I didnt want to put anyone in a bad position.Turns out they didn’t have money to build on it and that there’s a crazy neighbour who makes the experience miserable. So she decided not to live there and is attempting to sell it. I don’t believe she ever really intended to live there full time and planned to Airbnb it out.So my dad offered me hundreds of thousands of dollars later in a way to make it fair, since he spent the same on my sisters property. Just straight cash. Fuck it. I used quite a huge chunk as a down payment for my first home. My mortgage payments are low and I’m very very happy with it.I was honest with my sister about this. She was not super thrilled. She now thinks the situation is unfair as I had a choice in how the money was spent and she didn’t. My dad said he feels tricked and that she lied to him about wanting to live up there. She thinks as a way to make it fair my dad should now purchase this property off her for $400,000. Which means he would have bought this property twice.I tried to tell her I thought this was fucking insane but she got very worked up. So I just left it. I think she was under the impression we were on the same “team.”My dad asked what I thought. I told my dad I thought this was fucking ridiculous. That she hasn’t worked in three years and her full time job is begging my parents for money constantly. For things she just wants and doesn’t need. I said she was the most entitled person I’d ever met in my life. Just absolutely went off.Another long story but basically my mom filmed the conversation and sent it to my sister.

They’re always ‘fighting’ (jokingly), steal eachothers shit etc. When they were younger, Riley did used to pick on Adam but my wife and i resolved it.For the past year or so, they’ve really gotten closer. Adam has always been a quiet child and Riley is the textbook extrovert and he’s really helped his younger brother come out of his shell. Adam has a twin sister, Kate, who is equally as extroverted as Riley but i think that gaining that bond with his older brother is what helped him change. Growing up, Adam and Kate fell into the ‘loud twin and quiet twin’ roles so i think his new closeness with Riley is what helped.A few weeks ago, Riley asked me if he could take Adam with him on a weekend trip with his friends who are all 22-26. Now, when i was younger, i used to take my younger brother on trips with my friends but we only have a 3 year age gap, not 8. And my younger brother was not as anti-social as Adam tends to get. Plus, sometimes the boys take it too far when messing with each other and my wife and i have to intervene before they actually get upset with each other.As much as i love Riley, he is also not the type of person you can entrust a person to—i wouldn’t even trust him with a goldfish. He’s the type of person who forgets to eat and take meds and Adam is hypoglycemic and because of his social anxiety, I don’t think he’d take himself to the kitchen in the apartment they’ll be renting for the trip if there are other people there. I’d maybe feel safer if Kate went too, but i don’t want to send my daughter on a trip with a bunch of guys.For these reasons, i said no and i told them why in a watered down way. He accused me of not trusting him and Adam to behave themselves and is currently very upset with me. Adam is also pretty annoyed with me for ‘treating him a child’.

The car was worth less than the amount it would have been to fix it. My parents graciously bought me a new car that I am very thankful for. They were set on this one used car that was a cheaper option and I was okay with that. While we were at the dealership to test drive, they saw a new one that we all really liked that was about $4000 more than they were planning on spending. When we got home I told them I was okay with either and I’m not gonna be picky since they are the ones buying it. They should just do what they think is right. The next week I was told I was getting the cheaper option but they came home with the new car. I was very happy and thankful that I had a car at all since I have to drive an hour everyday for work and I was ubering for the time being. They then told me they bought it in cash and SINCE they got the new car, I should pay them $500 by the end of the summer for it. That’s a bit under what I make in a week but I only work during the summer and a few weeks in the winter since I am a sophomore in college. The car is under my moms name, not mine. I am not sure if/when it will be transferred to mine but I am assuming when I’m done with college. I would be happy to pay any amount for it then since it will actually be mine. I have always paid for my own gas but they pay for my insurance. I If they had told me that the new car would cost me $500 beforehand, I would have made them get the cheaper option. I genuinely would have been fine with any car if it meant I didn’t have to pay and they knew that. I also go to school 8 hours away and as of now there is no point in me having a car on campus so I leave it at home. They also just don’t want me to bring it to school even if I wanted to since it would be a burden on my dad. I feel it is unfair for me to pay for a car when I can really only use it for 5 months out of the year. I wouldn’t mind paying for it when I am able to bring it to school since I will be the primary user. My dad also uses the car sometimes when I am at school since he doesn’t want to put miles on his. I also want to reiterate that my parents did not buy a new car out of the kindness of their hearts. It was obviously very nice of them to lend me a car at all but they got the new one because they want to show off to their friends. I am aware I am very fortunate for getting a car at all but AITA for refusing to pay for the car?Edit: the car is in my mom’s name for insurance reasons but they will switch it to my name once I’m out of school. They know I am very appreciative of the car but they wanted me to show my grate-fullness by paying. I would have been okay with literally any car that worked as I do not really care for materialistic items. They have always been into a flashy lifestyle and wanted to buy me a version of my previous car so it would look good in the driveway. I told them no since that would be ridiculous and I didn’t want to pay for premium gas. Even if I pay the $500 the car will NOT go in my name.Another edit: I know it sounds like I am super ungrateful and I am aware $500 for a new car is a great deal. That’s not the point. No one sat me down beforehand saying this is what was going to happen. I went into the whole car process under the impression I wouldn’t have to pay. That was the deal until they brought the NEW new car home. Then they decided I was gonna pay $500. If someone had told me beforehand, I would happily help out. The money is less of the problem than the fact that they sprung this on me without talking to me first. This makes me not want to pay anything.",

	"body" : "I (18m) live with my father, stepmother, and two youngest half-sisters. The oldest of the sisters is nonverbal autistic. We'll refer to her as Thing 1 and the younger sister as Thing 2. Thing 1 is 4 y/o, and Thing 2 is 2 y/o.Recently, we've been trying to train Thing 1's service dog, so he can be certified to accompany her into places when we have outings. Today, my stepmom, Thing 1, Thing 2, and I decided to head to the shops while Dad was at work. We stopped at the local supermarket to pick up some cat food and other necessities.We arrived, had a lovely shopping experience, and went to the tills to checkout. Thing 1 and her dog were in the basket of the trolley, and Thing 2 was sitting in the children's seat. My stepmom paid for her things, and then I began paying for my stuff. As I did so, I watched as Stepmom took Thing 1 and her dog put of the cart, as they both had become restless for waiting so long.Almost immediately after they were taken out, the dog made a mess in the floor, which Stepmom was happy to clean up with towels and spray given by the cashier. By this time, Thing 2 started in on a crying fit. I quickly finished the transaction, and grabbed the dog, made sure he didn't make any further messes, and placed him back in the trolley. I went to return Thing 1 to the basket as well, only to realize she was nowhere to be seen. We quickly split up to search for her.Five minutes, a missing child announcement, and a couple heart attacks later, we found her next to the cookie display. We called off the search the employees started, and we made our way out of the store. The rest of the outing went off without a hitch, and we all returned home safely.All was fine, and no words were had about the trip until my dad returned from work. My stepmom told him about the scare that Thing 1 gave us today, and he proceeded to lay into me about how irresponsible I am and how I should've been paying better attention.My stepmom isn't upset with me in the slightest, but what my father said made me really rethink the situation.

They are keeping it for 4-5 days while waiting for the necessary parts.When he dropped his car off, my brother asked if he could borrow my car for the days he will be without his vehicle. However, I had to say no.The reason I declined is because I rely on my car heavily for my daily work commute and errands. I drive a lot for my job throughout the day and need it to get to meetings and appointments. I sometimes even use it for deliveries. Going days without a car would significantly impact my ability to work.My brother was a little annoyed when I declined, but said he understood. I could tell he was hoping I would give him my car keys to use while his is in the shop. He is not saying anything but I can tell he is still a bit annoyed.I feel bad that he's without a vehicle right now, so I offered to help him get a rental car or see if some friends might be able to help drive him during this time. But he waved off those suggestions.Now my parents heard about this and are saying I'm being unreasonable for not just handing my car over to my brother when he's in a bind. For some background: He is the youngest and always was their \"Favourite\" if you will. We have a great relationship, but in situations like this I see my parents lean towards my brother.I want to help, but it's a big ask to lend my primary vehicle for days when I need it myself.AITA in this situation or are my parents?

	"body" : "2023 was a bit of a mixed year for me. On the positives I got an awesome new job with a significant pay bump, and completed a masters degree that I have been working on part time for the past few years. The low notes were that I hit a somewhat scary milestone birthday, and both of my parents were diagnosed with health conditions that will significantly impact their mobility and independence in the coming years. This has been a bit of a wake up call for me, and I've developed some anxiety about enjoying my health while I have it.It so happened that my birthday and completion of studies hit at about the same time, so I wanted to do something big-ish to celebrate. I love hiking so I wanted to finally do a multi-day hiking trip that I'd been considering for a while. When I decided on this trip, hubs was initially very annoyed about it, as it's not his type of thing. In general my husband is a bit of a work-a-holic, and most of our 'vacations' have been tacked onto his work trips (generally to nearby and uninteresting cities). He gets anxious if he is away from work for a while, and limited cell service is a no from him. I did offer to go alone (and pay for the trip from my personal savings), but eventually husband said he'd like to come, and we'd tack a bit of sight seeing on afterwards.After all was said and done, the trip was paid for partly from our joint account (which I contribute 50% to), and flights were paid from my personal savings.The trip ended up being mostly a success, however husband (as normal) took no interest in helping to plan, and left most of the booking and organisation to me. On my actual birthday he didn't organise anything (which I wasn't surprised about), but he also had scheduled two work meetings for that evening, meaning I spent my birthday in the hotel room with him on teams calls. When we got back he complained about the cost of the trip and demanded I send him more money from my savings account, which I did.The issue is, it is now husband's birthday and he's dropping lots of hints for big gifts that he wants. I spent about double what he did on me for Christmas presents, and have already bought him concert tickets, a cake and a picnic pack for his birthday party. When he drops these hints I remind him that he really put no effort into my birthday, but his position is that overall my birthday cost more and his effort was going on a trip he wasn't keen on.WIBTAH to stick to my guns and not buy the PS5 he's after?",

He tells me early last week that his birthday is next wednesday (24th). I'm like ok awesome what do you have planned? He tells me a week long party. He then goes on to describe how as a kid his birthdays weren't special and no one celebrated him, so he makes up for it as an adult with lavish parties.Didnt have much of a problem with that and said we should plan a date as well. He wants to look at his schedule first to see when he has time.Friday, his friends pick him up and he goes to a bar, then an elegant steakhouse where he drunk texts me saying he's so wasted that he spilled wine all over himself (he said his friends were kinda embarrassed about it). Then heads to a comedy club/bar for a night cap.We talk when he gets home and he expresses that he's been thinking about getting sober, stopping drinking & smoking (weed). But then the next day we text and he's at a bar at around 1pm, ig he added that bc it wasn't on the schedule. And then he goes to another bar after with a different group of friends, comes home and says he's so tired of drinking and he's done and wants to be sober. But 30 min later, he claims his friends showed up and  told him he has no choice. So he goes to a lounge and drinks again. Then repeats his frustration and desire to be sober.He tells me the rest of his schedule: his parents had a dinner with him today. Monday he's going out to a bar and club I think. Tuesday & Wednesday he's heading out of state to a dispensary and then partying at a casino. He plans on gambling and go clubbing. Friday he's heading to a hookah lounge. Thursday he may go to another bar but says he's open if we want to go on a date.And that's when I just kinda get fed up. I confronted him about it last night, how he keeps saying he wants to get sober but keeps going to places where he uses and drinks. It wouldn't have bothered me so much if he hadn't said it 3x in the last few days, then immediately changed his mind. So I tell him that we should be friends because I can't do all the excessive partying and the back and forth about his sobriety. It confuses me, and it's more than I want to handle.He texts me and says I must be confused bc he doesn't party often, and this is an exception bc it's his \"birthday\" week. I'm not a party person, and as someone with a history of alcoholic partners and substance abuse, I don't want to be triggered.I dont want to party and club and stay out all night. It's not me anymore.AITAH for telling him this, and was I being inconsiderate saying his birthday week was excessive?*Tldr: new guy I'm dating has a week long birthday celebration filled with 2-3 bars a day, lounges, mushroom trips, out of town weed haul, gambling and clubbing, and comedy clubs. I confront him on the excessiveness of it and point out the back and forth frustration he expresses about wanting to be sober. I tell him we should just be friends.",

But I let it go, and moved on, since there was no formal agreement.Fast forward to six months later, it's time to get a replacement. It's $4 per person, or $15 for one person. But, one of my roommates, Ashley (fake name) says \"i don't really notice a difference in my hair with or without it so i'm fine without it\" as an excuse not to pay. The other two seem fine with paying it.I'm annoyed because it's not as though I can just take the filter off and on at will, and I have done all the labor for it in terms of buying and installing. So essentially, Ashley is just going to be using my shower filter that she refused to pay for, AGAIN.It's $4, which leads me to believe that my roommate doesn't want to pay it on principle (her financial situation is not dire by any means).

However he likes to tell people he did it without any help and saved up all by himself. This it’s technically true, he did save the money by himself, but he also got help in that his parents let him live at home rent free and food free for years so he could save. He was able to save £30k in 2 years because of this!He was having some friends round (not a housewarming) and bragging about how he saved up all by himself and ‘didn’t just get a handout like some people’ whilst also looking at me. I was really shocked by this as, due to the housing market right now, everyone I know has had some help from family in order to buy homes, even those in couples.I basically said back what I said in the title and pointed out he lived at home rent free for years, so he did get help from his parents. One of his friends agreed with me, my bf got angry and the night ended shortly after. Once everyone left he told me I was an asshole and embarrassed him infront of his friends.So am I TA for this?Edit to address things that keep coming up: Yes he was deliberately looking at me when he made the comment, everyone could tell.He paid for nothing whilst living at home, no rent, no contribution to gas and electric, no council tax, he did not pay for food. He bought himself a newer car because he didn’t like the family one he was able to use.He bought at the end of November, housewarming was in December. This was not the first time he had made comments like that but the first time he had intentionally looked at me whilst making them.Edit: SpellingAfter university I house shared and rented for 5 years, I saved some money but nowhere near enough to buy because of the cost of renting. I said in comments and will say again I wouldn’t have my home if not for my grandma because of the housing situation in the UK right now.And to the person who said I let my grandmother die so I could have her money.

Most of the other girls chose to model their own designs, but I initially felt too shy to do so. I chose four of my friends to model for my outfits, who were from UK sizes 6-10, and made my dresses to fit their measurements.One of my friends (17F) was a size 8 (which is a size 4 in the US btw), and her dress was meant to be the centrepiece of my project. In the four months since I first started working on the dress, my friend has managed to gain a lot of weight. She was taking medication for her bipolar disorder, and one of the side effects was weight gain, going up 8 dress sizes. The material I used for my dress was quite stretchy so I thought her size wouldn’t matter that much. However, we were doing a rehearsal of the fashion show a few weeks ago when her dress suddenly split down one of the seams. We were three weeks away from the showcase, so there was still enough time to fix it. That said, I was worried that the dress might break again and there wouldn’t be enough time to mend it, or even worse, it might break during the actual catwalk. I decided that I should wear the dress instead since I knew the choreography of the catwalk, so we wouldn’t have to waste time teaching anyone else. Plus, all the other designers were wearing their own dresses, and I was started to regret my decision to stay behind the scenes.I broke the news to my friend and she was extremely upset over my decision. She had been looking forward to this for months, and she had been feeling depressed over her weight gain and thought that modelling make her confident again. I told her that it wasn’t her fault she gained weight due to her meds but I just needed a good grade and it wasn’t anything personal. She pointed out that we had three weeks until the show, so I had plenty of time to adjust the dress to make it bigger. In order to tailor the dress I would have to remove most of the embellishments and reapply them again after adding a large panel to the bodice. I still had to study for exams in two other subjects, and I didn’t want to risk over stressing and having an incomplete dress by the deadline, so I refused to alter the dress.

I told the woman that, unfortunately, the only stall in this bathroom that has a changing table is the handicap stall and I have been waiting for five minutes to change my son. I told her that I would be quick, and I went into the stall to change his diaper. While I was in there, I overheard the woman telling anybody that she could interact with that I was being rude, and was discriminating against her for her disability, by taking the handicap bathroom from her. It took me about two minutes to change my child's diaper and then I left the stall so that she could use it. As I was leaving the stall, the woman said to me \" I hope you feel good about yourself, taking a handicap stall from somebody that actually needs it\". I reminded her that the handicap stall is also the only stall that accommodates babies with a changing table, and that I had every right to use the stall. She scoffed at me and went into the stall. I don't know why this interaction is bothering me so much. I don't think I was in the wrong. But here I am asking Reddit, AITAH for asking a handicapped woman to wait for me to change my child's diaper?Adding info for some, I didn't think this would blow up like it didYes, I know you can change a baby's diaper virtually anywhere. Our car was honestly not a great option as it was packed full. I could have changed him in the front seat, but I also had to use the bathroom so it made more sense to simply go to the restroom and use the resources there.My husband took our 3 year old to the restroom in the men's room. This is usually how we do it as 90% of the time there is no changing station for baby's in the men's restroom in the USShe did not express any urgency to me. Only that she should have the stall due to her disability. I know it's possible she was too embarrassed to tell me her urgency, this is something I will never know.No I don't use cloth diapers but I will look into this if it is something that will really help his rashes!",

One of my abusers at that time showed up there. He wasn’t supposed to be. I was on call with this group of friends when I noticed he was watching me.

One of them being my big sister (26 female). My sister we will call her M came to visit a few years ago because she lives in another state. Leaving behind her boyfriend whom she lived with.  She stayed with me and she also stayed with her aunt where her cousin (male) was living. We will call him N. So I had a weird feeling when she was staying with me and my now ex. I felt like she would flirt with him. He did not flirt back but it still made me uncomfortable. Well when she went to stay with N she would tell me how hot he was and how she wanted to F*** him. When I dropped her off N was telling me how gorgeous I was and would love to take me out. Of course I rejected bc I was in a relationship. Well the next day she called me to tell me how they had F***** and proceeded to give me details. Then told me the next day they had done it again. Fast forward to now. She now has a new boyfriend and he found out about her and N and for some reason got mad even though he wasn’t in the picture at the time (I don’t think). He threatened to break it off if she didn’t tell him the truth if they slept together and now she is saying that N rapped her. So M’s new boyfriend told her dad and her dad made her press charges. So she is. She told me to stand by her side and testify that N rapped her. And I just don’t believe it. When I ask her why she lied to me and gave me all those details and was so happy. She said that N threatened to kill her. I also now N well and he’s not that type of guy to threaten to kill someone. M said that N was very drunk and don’t remember having sex but I talked to him and he gave me very similar details that she did back then. So it is just hard for me to believe she’s telling the truth. Especially being a rapped victim myself…I testified on N’s behalf and now she has blocked me on everything and wants nothing to do with me for not supporting her.",

The problem is worsened as I tend to sleep later, about 4-5 hours after she goes to bed, playing games online with my friends. Moreover she is a light sleeper and our walls are thin.To be honest I come from a loud family and she comes from a quiet one and I recognize that I can get over excited and lose track of my volume sometimes. That being said, since she first complained I’ve tried to mind how loud I’m being after she goes to sleep. I speak below my normal volume, not a whispering but I try to be as quiet as possible while still being heard through a mic. She also wears noise canceling headphones when she sleeps but nothing seems to be helping.I’ve never had this problem before with my previous roommates and I know I was louder with them. I can’t tell if it’s really my fault and I don’t know what else to do but to just stop talking all together at night, but I don’t want to give up my hobby.Regardless I might be the asshole for being loud and keeping her up. Please decide.Edit: mentioned this in a reply, thought it was important context. I don’t really know about the NC headphones being true because she has accused me of things before and I had to place cameras in our apt to defend my innocence.

Large majority speak their native tongue (not English/ Spanish) yet do carry our conversations in English. The 20% speak Spanish as native. Over the months; I began to notice my colleague/ fellow aide focus on the Spanish speaking. I have no problems with that; except when I noticed I am spreading myself thin; running from student to student all across room.To mediate this; 1st respectfully and informally; I asked my Spanish speaking students to converse in English( Hey J; I want to understand what you’re saying too). Aide continues to converse in Spanish. Ok. Next up; the 4 in same class; I greet them in AM and ask/ challenge them to attempt to converse in English( also I’d assist as necessary); to which they agreed. Then before class; I also gave aide heads up. Then in class; aide is the one whom initiates conversation not in English. After class; I bring it up indirectly. “ Dang; I failed at challenging my Spanish speakers to engage in English Conversations!”Next day; since we didn’t have students all day; Teacher probes and ask me how I am doing. I shrug it off “ I’m good”. Then 30 mins later; I call to their attention; “ I lied to you; I am very frustrated”. Then I asked for the floor with teacher and aide. I explained my frustration; listened to both their perspectives; set my boundaries- (also include personal space; as a few times he has tapped me on shoulder when we are in close space) and I am aware as we are sharing space and I moved on.

My sister says he’s a huge softie on the inside and is actually very kind. He definitely treats her well, he pays for her nails/lashes/etc, got her a new BMW car, supports her hobbies, takes her on expensive vacations. I hate to admit it but he’s a decent boyfriend.

After this, M sent me a long text about my health/asking me to step down as a bridesmaid. I was hurt but responded that it’s her wedding/decision & I support her choice with a heart emoji. Her response was a “love” reaction. It’s been radio silence since. We were talking daily prior to this.I was hurt and a bit shocked, it’s over a year out & she’s keeping the flaky addict but dropping me/didn’t even have the respect to call to tell me. I’ve been evaluating/grieving this friendship for 3 months & realizing we aren’t compatible anymore.My health is vastly improved, thanks to my Chinese medicine Dr (better than my whole team of western docs) I already have less frequent/debilitating migraines, more energy, & I’m on the path to wellness. Not that M would know this, but it’s so nice to finally get some answers/relief!I got a Save The Date with only my name on the envelope. I’ve lived with bf well over a year now. Maybe he’d be a plus 1 (we discussed him coming) but combined with her comments last year it really rubbed me wrong.It’s a 6-7 hour drive WIBTA to not go?",

She said she will repay me when she can and i was like yeah sure whenever you can. Last yr (post break up) we texted a bit and met twice. She also moved in with her new bf.Issue is, while she has a job, she has to support her parents, has credit card debts and student debt. So she is in a tough situation financially. Though noteworthy is she likes to live comfortably- flies only delta, bougie dinners in Manhattan. On the other hand, i am very comfortable financially. Last week i sent her a text if she would be open to repaying some money this year. Because her debts/loans will take forever to clear, i thought slowly she can start clearing my balance. She curtly said she will repay me next month. But then has gotten cold, not responding to my texts, giving me silent treatment.AITA here? Is it bad manners to follow up with close friends for money, when you are financially secure while they are struggling?Edit: I am 100% confident she will pay me back. My concern is that I jeopardized our friendship by asking my money back, instead of letting her work on a repayment schedule.",

My uncle, grandma and my sister also live here. I've been dating someone for a couple months and he's great. Everyone in the family loves him, especially my mom. He's sweet and respectful and he's great with my daughter and considers her his own, so he comes over maybe 2-3 times a week and hangs out with me and my daughter. My mom left for vacay for two weeks and after she left he took it upon himself to tell me my bf can't stay past 11 even though we're both adults (I'm 21 and he's 22) and we also are very considerate. We don't cause noise we literally just talk and watch movies after I put my daughter to sleep. He approached us in a very condescending and rude manner as if we are 14. I asked him why and if he had talked to my mother about it because my mother had never has a problem with him staying late. He said no he didn't talk to my mom and barely gave a reason on why he has to leave. He basically told us we had to obey this and that he is the authority figure without any discussion. Mind you he's 34, doesn't pay rent at all, doesn't have a job, and living in my mom's house for over a year with no end in sight. She said he can stay for 6 months to help him out so he can get a new job and place.. Me and my bf didn't think much of it and honestly took it as a joke or suggestion. We continued hanging out past 11 whenever he would come over making sure to be mindful of noise and just be in my room chillin. Nobody else in the house has ever complained of his presence including the owner of the house, my mom. This morning he came to me with once again a very condescending and rude tone. Saying we dishonored him and disobeyed him so now my bf isn't allowed to come over at all and he will call the police if he even steps foot in the house. I think this is very extreme and he basically threatened me. My bf is the sweetest most calm guy and they have probably had like two conversations in total lmaoo. It's just crazy that he would take it that far over two adults spending time together a little late in someone else's house. Just confused and upset because this dude isn't even supposed to be here. He’s temporarily living here and doesn't pay rent and he's not my father. And I'm also not a child, I'm 21 years old with a child of my own minding my business and not bothering him at all. Why is he telling me what to do when this isn't even his house and the person who does own the house has no issue at all? I'm not doing anything wrong and that's why I didn't feel the need to listen to him. ATP I'm just gonna wait for my mom to come back and discuss it with her. To avoid confrontation I won't have my bf come over but am I the asshole?And btw I'm working and saving to get my own place soon.",

She will do homework last minute and often ask for extensions with work.She had a tendency to remind me to pay for school related things like lunch money, just before I’m going to bed, or that she needs to take something into school so can we run to the store and quickly get it.Last month, I went on a wild goose chase to help Mia locate ingredients for her home econ class, after she told me at half 10 she needs xyz ingredients and she just checked the fridge and we don’t have it.She was reading the ingredients of an email, and when I saw it was dated a week prior, got annoyed Mia couldn’t have told me before when we did the big food shop for the family.I told her the next time she needs something for school to tell me the day she gets told or the day after latest, or I will not be helping her out.My husband has stopped helping Mia with her last minute requests and calls me a pushover for helping her out, but when she asked today to put down the deposit for a school trip I put my foot down.Mia has known since the start of the school year she had a school trip to Germany. Her school sent an email out two months ago asking for deposits for kids to secure their place on trip. It’s is about 150, and Mia asked me today to pay as the deadline is midnight or she may not be able to go.I reminded her what I said last time about deadlines and organisation and as she chose to tell me last minute I will not be paying for her deposit. She got upset as all her friends from history class are going.I told Mia that she can pay herself from her savings as she has a part time job, which is more than enough to cover her deposit, but she wanted to save up to buy a new game console.I told her to pick if she wanted to go on the trip or get a new game console and she called me an AH, and now I’m wondering if I’m being unreasonable. My husband is on my side but my youngest said it was mean and Mia is very upset with me.ETA- Mia doesn’t have ADHD, but she is dyslexic so this does explain the schoolwork sometimes, but she will ask for extensions on top of her extensions which is a sore spot for her and my husband who wants her to be more organised and not leave work last minute.Mia has been tested for ADHD and doesn’t not have it, I did my research at the time and realised it often gets overlooked for girls but even after getting another opinion she doesn’t have ADHD.

I also teach two classes, which isn’t a ton but when combined with student leadership positions, it adds up. I have no free time essentially. Most days, I am out the door by 7AM and I don’t get back until 7PM if I’m lucky, then I have homework and grading and yadda yadda yadda. In short, I’m exhausted. I get so excited when my day is done and all I can think about on the drive home is getting to see my partner and relax together a little. And it’s practically impossible to get that from him. He knows what time I get home everyday, I’ll ask him to be ready to hang out when I get back, and yet I walk into a silent apartment at the end of each day because he’s been locked in his office playing video games the entire time i’ve been gone.

I get home and spend another hour or so alone waiting on him so we can figure out dinner and actually see each other, and then it’s right back to it after dinner. he’ll stay up until 4AM gaming from there.

He flips on me and blames me for both not telling the guy the 'f**k off' and for not telling him the instant it happened.Context: Gym creep - GC Dear husband - DHDH works at the gym and we were both training at the time and getting to the end of the workout, I was on a treadmill, the GC saw my DH come to me as he was on a treadmill too (around 5 treadmills down) we kissed and cuddled then he left to get changed. GC proceeds to leave his treadmill and stand next to me on mine trying to hit on me, asking me questions, telling me 'you look good' etc. At this point I gather my things and leave and go to another room, I feel really uncomfortable and have had bad experiences before when rejecting advances so opted not to say anything and just walk away.GC has had issues with another girl working at the gym and has been confrontational with her and this also contributes to knowing that I was right to just walk away.DH is a very angry person and is quick to anger, I didn't want anything to kick off so I waited until we were alone and away from the gym to tell him what happened and to avoid any confrontation. He works there so it is not hard to find the person and put a note on his file for harassment, also, i didnt want him to get angry, do something stupid and jeopardise his job there.Come home time, he's getting more and more worked up, saying things like 'I'm not that person anymore, I would have just said \"that's my wife, don't hit on her\"' then he asks me to repeat what happened, then flipped on me saying why didn't you tell him to f**k off and mimicking me being scared and crying, 1. I did not cry, 2. It's basically victim blaming for want of a better description of what he's doing. Note: I don't feel like a victim but felt creeped out, I feel this valid and putting a note on the file may help in the future if he does it again or he may have even done it before, the gym I'm at tries to minimise this behaviour, because obviously it's uncomfortable for women who just want to train.DH proceeds to get more and more angry, shouting, verbally abusive, words like 'cu*t being thrown around, etc. Do I really want a life with someone that I can't come to talk about these incidents that happen that make me feel vulnerable, and then to make me feel like it's my fault. I understand he must feel frustrated and he said so in so many words. I'm not sure speaking to another gym staff member about it instead would have helped either and would have upset DH because I didn't go to him.So, what I want to know is, AITA here or should I have just kept my mouth shut and not have said anything?EDIT: I just want to say thanks for the input and advice. It seems I have a lot to think about. When the situation is flipped on its head, I understand how this is abuse. I consider myself to be a strong woman, but not at the moment.

She has never watched my daughter for even a few hours on her own. She has always been flaky and will make big promises and not follow through, or cancel last minute. She loves her carefree life without kids, she doesn't pay for her house or her car, doesn't have medical aid, she spends most of her income on personal care, grooming, shopping, etc. She gets really angry when I cancel plans with her, and I have had to cancel plans in the past, but only because my daughter got sick which often happens because she's in school.Last weekend, we spent the day with family and my daughter played with her cousins. My sister spent most of the day smoking and drinking with the adults, and never looked after the children. When it came time to go home, my daughter didn't want the party to end and my sister made all sorts of promises to her, saying that she could go home with her and stay with her for the night, etc. She didn't talk to me about this before, so I originally took it as empty promises to keep a preschooler from crying.But when I confronted my sister and told her that she can't just promise my daughter things and make arrangements for her without checking with me first, she became very angry, disrespectful and belligerent with me. I had to tell her that she has no right to make decisions for my daughter without checking with me first, and she didn't agree with me, until I said that they could of course do a sleepover, we just had to make the proper arrangements. You can't just change the plans willy nilly, or make promises to a child that you don't intend on keeping.I feel deeply disrespected by my sister and feel like she is undermining my authority with my daughter. My husband and I are going through a divorce, and my sister is really judgmental and not supportive at all. Her response to my initial announcement was to change the subject to her relationship status with her on-off long-term boyfriend. I am afraid that if she spends time with my daughter, she will talk badly behind my back or do things that I wouldn't be okay with. She also smokes and I don't want my daughter around that.My sister just texted me to ask if my daughter, who has never spent a night away from me, can spend the weekend with her. So AITA for not wanting that to happen right now? And should I explain myself or just make an excuse and say why now isn't a good time?

	"title" : "AITA for telling my aunt that she needs to worry less about herself and more about her kids?",
	"body" : "Posting on a throwaway because I'm pretty sure my aunt knows my actual account.My aunt (29F) and I (17F) have never really gotten along (mainly because she comes from the suburbs and my immediate family lives in a rural area), but our relationship has gotten worse since my uncle passed. Ever since then, it's like she's been more and more focussed on material stuff (fancy bags, makeup, etc.) and appearances than her actual kids, and, although I ignored it at first, it really started rubbing me the wrong way.Once or twice, I have seen her send her children (we'll call them Mikayla, Jane, and Evelyn), into a different room because they accidentally spilled juice on/dirtied their clothes (not to change, but to be away from everyone else). When I say clothes, I really mean dresses, because I don't think she lets my cousins wear anything but plain pastel or white dresses, even though they're young (3-6) and will probably get them dirty quickly.I told my brother (15M) about how I felt bad for our cousins, and he told me to shrug it off because our aunt was \"probably just grieving in her own way\", and that I should \"let her be\", because I'd probably do more harm than good. I understand that grieving can be hard, but it's been almost a year and I don't think our cousins really have anyone to speak to.This weekend, we were over at my grandma's house for a barbeque to celebrate Mikayla's 6th birthday, and I thought that maybe my aunt wouldn't be as distant today, since we were celebrating her daughter. I thought everything was fine, until we went outside for the barbeque.Since Mikayla was the birthday girl, she got to choose what piece she wanted before everyone else. She chose a piece and my aunt immediately cut in and told her no, because she'd ruin the dress she was wearing. I told my aunt that the purpose of the barbeque was to have fun for my cousin's birthday, and that she was being too strict.She told me it wasn't my problem, and I told her Mikayla was my cousin and she clearly wasn't happy, so it really was. This turned into a full on argument and she said that \"just because you live in the dirt, doesn't mean my kids should\". In return, I told her that \"you should stop worrying about appearances for a change, because unless you haven't noticed, you have kids to look after\".We left soon after, and my mum told me I was insensitive and that \"you shouldn't berate your aunt because you'll understand all of this when you have kids of your own\". I told her that I didn't want to have kids if I was going to treat them like dolls I had to keep clean, but my parents have taken my aunt's side and I'm wondering if I should be feeling guilty.So, AITA?",

I'm about to have a baby and want to un-invite them from the hospital and \"meeting the baby\" visits but not sure if I'm just hormonal.When our first son was born in 2018 (first grandchild), my in-laws finally drove the 1 hour to meet him when he was almost 2 months old. We were drowning, but they definitely didn't come to offer any help, just held him for a minute, asked when we were having another one (lol) and left. I don't think they even brought a gift.During the first years of his life they barely saw him. Even when we visited their city, which was pretty frequently, they couldn't be bothered to meet up or let us come over. 2 years ago they moved to our community so my husband can take care of them in their old age (something we did not agree to). They see our two kids every week now and do treat them well.At first I thought they just weren't into being grandparents. But my husband's oldest sister just had her first baby, and the in-laws flew across the US to stay with them for a month to \"help.\" (Unsure whether they are helping as they have always parentified their kids, especially with housework.) They even had to get FIL's dialysis treatments transferred over there so this was no small thing.It's possible that in the past they were just going through a rough time and didn't have space to think about their grandkids. But I've always been treated as less than in their family (most famously, was uninvited by MIL from SIL's wedding because I was pregnant and me being there would \"ruin the day for SIL\"). It's even harder for me to tolerate seeing my husband feeling unloved. It's been so sad for him to feel like they don't care as much about him or his family.I'm about to have our third and last baby and we are going to need so much more help than we ever did with the others. I'm sure the in-laws will not offer any. But would it be too petty of me to 1) not allow them to visit us in the hospital, and 2) tell them they can visit only if they're planning to do some housework and not just hold the baby? (I have not discussed this with husband yet.) I want to because I'm mad and vengeful. But hormones are raging so I'm not sure whether to trust my feelings.EDIT: Comments have shown that I was unclear: I am not asking for help because we can't handle a baby on our own, but because they offered it to SIL and have never offered it to us. My husband also feels slighted. Also, I find hosting stressful and don't really like people coming over just to hold the baby and expect me to entertain them.",

We're classmates on that one subject that were grouped together then hit off as becoming besties. The issue is that she's a great friend to hang out with. I just don't like her in anything about academic related.She always asked for my answers on activities, but never helped me when I needed it. I told her that if we both work together to solve then only we can share solutions but it seems she doesn't notice that and continues to bombard me with messages asking for my activities. I know I should have cut her off when I saw signs but she's really a great friend. Like we're comfortable sharing our ups and downs.  I guess we were becoming too comfortable with each other in such a short time. This semester, we had two classes together. One of them required an argumentative essay in a week. Iris got   sick during that week. She didn't say what it was but I never pressed on that matter since it's her health and she may be uncomfortable to share it. So she was given an excuse to pass the assignment at a later date, this is according to our university policy.I didn't expect her to  come up to me to want to read the argumentative essay that I've created. I'm not exactly sure what she said but it was something like, \"Can I read your essay? I just want to get the idea since I don't know where I will start.\" I was shocked at the situation and just smiled at her awkwardly. I just told her I'm busy and needed to go somewhere then she says that she will talk to me later.Unlike before, this time she is really persistent. She came to my apartment, called and messaged me constantly, and even contacted my friends and parents.  I don't know what's got into her. Last time it was just messages and sometimes I would ignore it but this time it's too much.I only contacted her again when she passed her assignment. I invited her to the talk at my apartment because I feel like this needed to be in private.During our talk she blamed me for getting a zero and a major offense due to using a.i and high plagiarism because I didn't let her read my work. She started to yell at me and  I was sobbing and hurt at her hurtful words. I'm thankful my roommate was there hearing us and dragged her out.Just yesterday, Iris decided to come to my apartment apologizing and I accepted it.

Me and Lucy are close, known each other since early high school, and occasionally I’ll get guys asking me for her number or if she’s seeing anyone (don’t give your friends numbers to people). I don’t really mind it but I usually end up saying “oh I don’t know, I’ll ask her” or something like that.An acquaintance of mine, “Adam” (M20 I think) recently asked me about Lucy. I don’t really know Adam, other than from class, but he’s super introverted and kind of a stoner. No judgement there, trust me, he’s just not a great match. I told Adam that Lucy wasn’t really looking (true), but he told me he had a plan to ask her out and he asked me for her schedule so he could execute said plan. I told him no and that it wasn’t a good idea for him to go after her like that. He freaked out a little and told me I was being selfish and that he was a great guy and it was unfair of me to keep him from her. He told me to nudge Lucy in the right direction and to just give him a chance. I told him sure so he’d get off my back.Of course it’s Lucy’s decision, i’m not her keeper like Adam seems to think, but she deserves to know the full story, and I told her. She’s glad I didn’t give him anything and she was a little creeped out and ended up blocking his instagram.I don’t really think i’m the AH but guess I just want to give him the benefit of the doubt and i’m feeling a little guilty for maybe making unfair presumptions even though Lucy made her decision. AITA?UPDATE: So yeah I wasn’t expecting anything else to happen but I opened my instagram when I got home today and saw a bunch of angry dms from Adam. He noticed she blocked him (kinda strange, I guess he was checking her account) and called me all sorts of names and accused me of some stuff.——Info: I’m gay, I have a girlfriend of 2 years that I love very much, Lucy is straight, we’re just friends and absolutely nothing has occurred between us. She’s like a sibling to me. My girlfriend is also friends with Lucy now and there are no problems there.——Adam’s accusing me of keeping Lucy for myself and I’m just a little freaked out. I’m open with my sexuality and my school is very progressive, I guess just a little worried of Adam saying/doing something. Yuck. Anyway, he’s blocked now and I’m absolutely sure I made the right decisions. Also i got a message on here asking if my friend would be interested in someone. It never stops lmao. Thanks for reading",

For context I have full custody of our child, he lives with me full time and sees his father on Tuesdays for a few hours but recently his father has started helping out more and helping me to care for him when he's sick and can't go to daycare or if I need a babysitter etc so he's been seeing him a lot more recently than just on Tuesdays. However the reason, well the biggest reason anyway, as to why I have custody is because my son's dad is a drug addict and recently spent some time in jail for being in possession of a fire arm. We are not Americans and were we live only the police and hunters are allowed to have fire arms. He got out of jail about 1½yrs ago and hasn't had any relapses since. He is in treatment however, meaning he gets methadone that he gets to pick up once a week and has to take daily.On to the issue. His brother (33) has the same problems as he does regarding drugs, and currently lives with their mother. We have never gotten along and he has been extremely disrespectful in the past, calling me a wh**e and stuff and also blaming me for him and hos  brother's falling out, which is completely false.

	"body" : "My wife (simone) and I are in our thirties. We reside out of state and rarely get the opportunity to travel back to our hometown to see family. The primary reason for our trip is to attend my older brothers (bart) baby shower. My younger brother (Tim) in his twenties also lives out of state and specifically traveled back to spend time with me. He was staying with my parents, while my wife and I prefer to stay with her family since staying with mine can be chaotic and stressful. My wife and I had a packed schedule to see both sides of the family as well as friends.Planned in advance, Bart, his wife Lola, Simone and I were to play DND. A prior invitation to Tim to play DnD online suggested to me that DnD did not interest him since he scoffed at the idea. The night prior to playing DnD, I was exhausted and went to bed early.Wednesday morning, I looked at my phone and there was a message from Tim asking what my plan was tomorrow. I misread the sent date/time, and this is where I feel awful. I interpreted his message as having been sent that morning. If I had read correctly, I would have realized it was sent the night prior asking what I was doing on Wednesday. I responded to the message as I interpreted it thinking he referenced Thursday.Wednesday evening was a blast playing DnD. It was a great gathering that made fun connections and memories. Unfortunately the most memorable facet was the aftermath. All of our phones had missed calls from my mom. She left a few messages trying to figure out why Tim was not invited to the game night. This was followed up by my Dad texting Bart and I that we were raised better than this and that all four of us should be ashamed of ourselves.Simone and I leave, but it got way worse when Bart gets on the phone with our parents, and it develops into an explosive screaming match in which past drama was dug up. Hurtful words were exchanged. Lola heard the conversation and let Simone and I know. After the hurtful conversation Bart uninvites my parents to the baby shower. It honestly put a dark shadow on an otherwise lovely trip home. It may have even altered the dynamic between Bart, Lola and my parents.Tim felt that I had intentionally deceived him about the plan to play DnD when I would never want to make him feel excluded. I did apologize to Tim. He, Bart and I are on decent terms now.Tim has not always had positive interactions with the sisters in law. Bart and I have done our best to keep everyone happy, but Tim can antagonize and make the situation uncomfortable.  Although the perceived exclusion was based on a misunderstanding, I did not specifically give him an invite both because of his lack of interest coupled with his dynamic with Bart, Lola, and Simone.I felt that my actions caused this rift in my family. Am I in the wrong for not specifically making him feel invited to play DnD?",

	"title" : "AITA for expecting my husband to replace the things his dog has ruined?",
	"body" : "My husband Cam and his dog Peter moved into my house while we were dating. We still live here and are married. Peter has peed on countless rugs. Every time, Cam said he’d replace them, but never did. I did. Peter peed on countless toys, indoor decor, outdoor decor, and expensive suede boots. I work hard for my kids and I to have some nice things. Peter pees on them. Cam says he’ll replace them. He doesn’t. I do. Peter goes outside often, pees on our front porch and main walkway, then marks everything he can. He’s been to the vet. No UTI. Behavioral. My other dogs don’t do this.After marriage, Cam stopped being affectionate with Peter and stopped having him groomed. After empty promises, that’s fallen on me.Now a few years later, Peter is 14. Marking daily. I don’t think it’s entirely incontinence. At night he stays shut in our room so he can’t go mark, but that makes the room too warm for Cam, so he sleeps downstairs or on the couch. Peter’s nightly habits are affecting my sleep and health, triggering chronic migraines.I begged on working toward a solution. Cam said he’d try diapers. After weeks went by, he finally got some and I said he needed bathed after having any accidents in them. He only put them on him a few days. Peter still tried marking while wearing the diaper and the diaper worked absorbing, but the kids would forget he was wearing one, being a new routine, and let him outside in it. Cam stopped putting them on him, blaming the kids.I’ve been sick. I couldn’t take Peter’s noises last night, needing sleep, so I shut him in the bathroom. Four hours later, he barked and I let him outside. He’d peed and pooped in the bathroom, tracking through it. I asked Cam to clean it and bathe him because I’m sick. He cleaned up the poop and left the pee, saying he didn’t see it. I couldn’t fall back asleep.I asked Cam if we could talk. He says I’m blaming him, but it’s Peter’s fault. I said I don’t think a dog’s behavior falls solely on the dog- he needed training years ago. He kept saying he doesn’t like getting blamed. I said it’s not about fault, but I’m frustrated with both of them and it isn’t fair he won’t replace the things he ruined. Cam said he can’t afford to replace any of it, so we just shouldn’t have those things. This seems entirely unfair to me. He earns a good salary, double what I make. He got loud, over-reactive in front of my kids and said he’ll “go take care of Peter right now,” scooping him up, giving the impression he’d put him down. I told him that’s not how those decisions are made, he needs a diaper, better sleeping arrangements, and a vet visit. Cam says I’d have to pay for it. Cam’s insistent he’ll “take care of it” so he “won’t be blamed anymore,” but putting the weight of that on me and my kids so we can have our “things.” AITA?",

	"body" : "Long time lurker, first time poster. I don't have many friends so I genuinely don't have anyone else to askMy (42F) best friend (Jane, 42F) got engaged on New Year's Day; this is her first engagement, and she's never been married. She and her fiancée, Joe (40something M), have been living together for about 5 years. Info-he does not like me. I didn't do anything deliberate to cause this, but I met him during the pandemic and we disagreed about masks. I've tried to let bygones be bygones, but his dislike for me remains. I'm sure there must be more to it but I genuinely don't know.I found out about the engagement in a convoluted way. We've been friends for 20+ years & both have adult children. One of Jane's daughters posted about the engagement on SnapChat, where one of my daughters saw it. My daughter sent me a text asking, \"Is Aunt Jane engaged??\" I was extremely surprised, but before I could respond, my daughter told me how she learned about it. I ran over to Facebook and there it was; Jane had posted about Joe asking her to marry him on January 1. By the time I learned about her engagement, it was January 4. She texted me on January 5, with save the date info. I responded, \"Yeah, I saw your fb post; congrats\" & she responded, \"Wow thanks\".This is where I think I'm the asshole. I was absolutely crushed that Jane didn't tell me personally, and I told her so. I told her that l'm happy for her if she is happy but that it really hurt my feelings to find out at the same time as 1000 other people. I told her that I was sorry for being selfish and making this about my hurt feelings when this is her time to shine. That was January 6; she still hasn't spoken to me.I'm devastated by all of this. I keep thinking, if I would have just had the right reaction then I wouldn't be here right now. My immediate family doesn't think I was wrong for my response, and l've asked one coworker & another casual friend who also think my response was valid; however, I think they're pretty obviously biased.I'm pretty sure this is the end of our friendship; I don't think Jane will ever speak to me again. So was I wrong for telling her about my hurt feelings instead of just being excited for her and showering her with blessings?Please go easy on me-my heart is already hurting, but be honest too.(Cross-posted on r/TwoHotTakes bc I need answers)ETA Info: A lot of you are asking about the reasons why the fiancée doesn’t like me and are (fairly) calling me out on not liking him. I met the fiancée for the first time in August 2020 and we had a disagreement over masks. Jane & I live in different states, about 4 hours apart but I also have family in the area where she lives. I rented a house for myself & my immediate family (spouse +4 kids) so that we could visit with my family as well as Jane & her family. Jane’s house is a little small, and she said it would be more comfortable for us to visit at the VRBO. We mostly stayed outside, social distancing, but we had made a big meal that was being served inside. The idea was for everyone to put on their masks to go inside & make their plates, then we would all go back outside to eat. That time and using the bathroom were the only times I asked anyone to wear a mask.I have reasons for disliking him & I’m sure he has his (valid) reasons for disliking but I don’t want this post to get derailed. BUT I’ve never been anything but open, genuine, & welcoming with him—nor has he ever been rude or even unpleasant towards me. Despite that, there has always been tension between us.Regarding our friendship—we’ve known each other since we were 17. In that time, we’ve had many disagreements, arguments, even ugly fallouts. We were best friends, both with strong personalities & loud opinions; we definitely have fought many times over the years. There have been times when I was selfish & not there for her when I should have been. I’ve not always been a good friend or even a good person, but we’ve always made up & come back together. This time feels different.",

I always try not to show or control them, but this situation is hard for me. On the other hand, I cannot understand if my boyfriend doesn’t understand me or if he doesn’t want to understand. When I’m having a panic attack and it’s quite bad, he tells me something like “stop crying” or “Can you be normal?” and I tell him that’s not helping me. When I’m analysing him, it looks like he’s manipulating someone. Yesterday I came back from work and he asked me if I'd make him dinner, and I told him, “Please make yourself; I’m tired.” Then he went to the kitchen, and I could hear him saying, \"She cannot make me dinner because she is tired. What kind of relationship is that?\" Or he always tells me about gym girls who're beautiful because they go to the gym. (I'm not going to the gym, but I love dance, and that’s my hobby.) Okay, moving forward, I’m afraid of planes and flying. Two weeks ago, my boyfriend texted me and told me, “We are going on vacation with my family. I already bought tickets if you didn’t want to go with us. My sister didn’t want that you go, but if you don’t go, then we should break up.\" I don’t like the fact that I cannot choose if I want to go or not because he already bought tickets and his family does not want me there. Well, a few days ago, I started getting panic attacks. I cannot sleep or eat. I've been crying all those days, and I’m crying now. I talk to him a lot, but it looks like he has some limits because he listens to me and then his patience is over and he starts screaming at me. Today he came up to me and said, “Can you stop being so dramatic and childish?” After these words, I think something snapped in me. I cannot look at him the way I used to. I really do not want to go with them, and he’s threatening to break up with me. I told him that I'd pay my half, but I don’t want to go. So AITA for not wanting to go on the trip?",

Since then, he has been super defensive towards me.  He’s also posted several passive aggressive articles and Instagram stories about boundaries and thanking those who “allowed him the courtesy of time and space and didn’t demand access to him.”  I was raised to believe that if someone loans you money, you should 1) never put them in a position where they have to chase you down for it or remind you to pay them back, and 2) be gracious and NEVER get defensive or get an attitude with them if the subject comes up.

She is very strict on how boys and girls shouldn’t be too close (no, she is not religious; this is more of her personal values). Carrie is very sheltered and has never been to any sleepover when there was a boy involved or participated in any traditionally boy-dominated activity. All her life Carrie’s doctor has been one of her female distant cousins on my stepmom’s side as my stepmom feels uneasy with her daughter having a male doctor.Carrie’s a sweet kid and although we’re not close because of our age gap we do love each other. My stepmom, fortunately, has never tried to restrict what I do. My mom’s family is very liberal and are active in my life.I have a boyfriend Matt (25m) who’s in med school. Several days ago my stepmom asked me to watch Carrie while she visited a friend and I said OK. My boyfriend on his rare down time stopped by to hang out and we just chilled and had snacks in the living room.Carrie came to us and asked to talk about her period. I asked her if she would like to only talk to me but she said she didn’t mind. I then explained all I knew but when she asked the more medical info I kinda turned to Matt and he stepped in and helped. Carrie actually asked a lot of questions that required Matt’s med school knowledge like hormones, how they will affect her growth, what symptoms she should watch out for, those kinds of things. She even asked about birth controls and STDs and again Matt really helped with the explanation. We searched for videos on the internet to help explain a few issues as well. In all, Matt and I thought it was an excellent afternoon. Carrie was more informed and confident by the end of it.Later, my stepmom learned that Matt gave Carrie “the talk” and she blew up. She said she didn’t doubt Matt’s knowledge but it was wildly inappropriate for me to let Carrie talk about this topic with a man when I know how she felt. She said a man, no matter his credentials, doesn’t deserve to know her daughter’s most private info like that. She said she planned to have Carrie’s doctor give her the talk anyway. I said it was fine and I was also there but she simply said she’s Carrie’s mother and next time I plan to do something like this I need to inform her first and she will decide if Carrie can take part in it or not.I mean, she IS Carrie’s mother so I wonder if I overstepped and should have told Carrie to wait to ask her mom instead?

It's not that I dont love my mom or think that I shouldnt pay her rent but I think its not justified if I do. What I mean by that is that my brother (M20) doesnt pay her rent at all. He used to pay rent after he got out of highschool but got paid a little more than I did. He got paid $16 while I get paid $14. Each pay check my mom took $150 out of his paycheck for rent since he got paid weekly, but since I get paid Biweekly it always seems to be a bigger amount for me since I have to give $300 (Edit: I pay $600 to $900 a month) but at the same time he got paid more than me so the rent is a more significant amount. But anyways, back to why I dont want to pay rent at all or at least a lot less.I'm barely at the house, I work 2-11 while I stay at my boyfriends house usually on my off days and after I get off from work. I dont eat anything I dont buy, mostly because on my lunch break I just go out to eat and I dont eat breakfast or lunch at my own house. Nevertheless, my brother, may I remind you again who is 20 years old, has no job and just plays video games all day. He hasnt had a job since he got fired from his old one which has been about a year and a half. My mother babies him and whenever I bring up that he should get a job she shuts me down and tells me that he doesnt have to because hes ashamed of how much he weighs. Yes, my brother is a pretty hefty guy but its not so much where he couldnt work. Ive offered to get him a job where I work but everytime he says \"I dont want to work yet\". So while I'm working 8 hours almost everyday to get money that i wanted to save up for to get a car and now almost half of it is going to rent, my brother gets spoiled by my mother without having to pay rent. She bought him his own car, pays for his food, pays for his gas, is paying $10,000 for a weight loss surgery for him, and so much more while now what he uses for free (plus more) I'm having to pay for my own for which I barely use.

However, Gordon didn't want to attend. This upset Ryan as he wanted his brother present for the celebration. Despite our efforts to persuade Gordon, he insisted on not attending, claiming he didn't want to go to Dave and Busters. In attempt to avoid any conflict with Gordon, I allowed him to stay home, with the condition that he remain in the house and answer our calls when we check on him. He agreed.Ryan really enjoyed his time at Dave and Busters and was eager about turning 13 next year. We checked in on Gordon three times while we were away.

We decided, due to his actions, to temporarily restrict his access to phone and PS5 until trust is rebuilt.This pissed him off and he said that I'm not his fucking father so I don't get to tell him what to do. I told him that I legally adopted him and told that whether he likes it or not he's living under my roof and will abide by my rules. My wife backed me up and told me supported my decision which only pissed him off even more. He eventually handed over his phone and his PS5 and I put them in my room. I told him that he'll get them back If he shows a change in his behavior.This led me wondering because my step son is barely talking to me and his mom at the moment and I feel like if we give him his things back he'll think that he can get away with anything.

Once he was found we only grounded him for 3 days.

Her exact line was, “It’s not like we’re needing that stupid money anymore.” I yelled back at her that she was entitled and selfish, and that the only reason she’s able to enjoy her current time is because of my stupid money. That she’s been having it far too easy the past year, and if she wanted to see what she’s owed, she can go back to either working, or doing all the chores she’s dumped on me.Anne was shell-shocked that I yelled back at her. The rest of the night was quiet, and she locked herself in our bedroom and hasn’t come out. I’ve called our kids, and told them what happened. My daughter agrees with me, but son says that I may have been too harsh to call her entitled, and implied that I undermined her efforts all those years as a SAHM. They’re going to take turns calling Anne, but I now wonder if I may have been overboard with yelling at her about taking it too easy.Daughter has suggested couple therapy, and said that she’s going to suggest it to Anne as well. I’m more than willing to do so, as today’s encounter made me reflect that I’m getting extremely tired and weary of this life.",

They host a family dinner before and some friends of J’s sister, M, are invited.We went there with K and my friend P, and brought a bottle of vodka. At 9:45PM, J tells us to arrive later, because dinner is still going. But we’re almost there after one hour of public transport, so we still arrive at 10PM.The dessert isn’t served, main dishes leftover are on the table, people are not eating anymore. We greet everyone and J brings some chairs for us to sit at the table. P goes to the garden for a smoke, K and I sit next to M’s friends. They serve us some wine and we talk for a bit. One of them asks if we want some of the leftover duck in front of us, I decline saying we already ate beforehand. They ask us again 4 times and I end up accepting. I tell K to try some as I know J’s mom’s Peking duck is very tasty. We each eat around 4 slices. Meanwhile, 2 of my friends arrive and smoke outside waiting for dinner to end.Then, J’s mom sits to have a toast with M’s friend and I ask for a glass. I didn’t know but it is a premium wine a friend of M brought as a gift. I brought a bottle too, I thought it was fine.Around 11PM some family members leave. There’re only M’s friends, our friends, two cousins and us. Our friends are sitting on the other side of the table.One cousin is a pastry chef, he brought a handmade king cake. They cut the cake and some get a slice, including P. Two of our friends decline.Karaoke starts, we sing for a bit. There’re still 3 slices of king cake left, I want to ask for one. I tell K, she says “I got it, follow me”. However, once next to the plate she notices she’s in front of the TV displaying the karaoke. So she proceeds to directly take the plate in front of M, brushes her without noticing, and brings it next to my friends. We sit down to eat a slice each. Just after we finish eating, M comes and says “It was for family only”. We both are feeling so ashamed. When I saw K take the plate I found it a bit strange but nothing alarming.When I finally get to talk to J, I apologize for the king cake, he tells me smiling that K and I are stupid and we move on.The party keeps going and ends without trouble.2 weeks later, I get to see J (w/o K) for the first time since NYE. He tells me he never felt so ashamed to invite friends, his family saw us eating duck but his mom didn’t invite us to eat it. She was a bit angry that I asked to toast with her and M’s friends and the king cake was the cherry on top, we didn’t ask and stole it.He says his family will laugh at him for years because of this.He says he never wants to see K again and he’s really disappointed in me.I apologized for the king cake but not for the duck nor the toast as I feel like neither K nor I made a mistake here.K wants to write an apology letter along with a gift for this incident but is waiting for my approval.",

My girlfriend is a math teacher and we talked about her potentially hosting a review class for extra money in one of the meeting spaces.She asked me about certain dates that happened to coincide with a major town wide  event right next to the hotel - the World Cup of cricket. She knows that this is going to be the highest revenue generating event of the year for the hotel and that I have been strategizing about the best way to approach it and have been turning down many groups as to hopefully be the last closest option and be able to charge a premium. We have 3 meeting spaces and with all the guest rooms also comes meeting spaces whether for team meals, team meetings, etc. Even if we got some sort of media staff we can’t have 100 people go over load our breakfast restaurant at once so we push big groups into a meeting space with a breakfast buffet as Courtyards do not have a buffet. I have deliberately turned away any meeting room only business over those dates as to save my space for the right group.When she asked me about the dates I tried explaining the situation that teams or staff or media potentially need the space and she said why does cricket need meeting space? I explained what I just wrote above about how if we need to give all these people breakfast we can’t do it in our restaurant, team meeting etc. and that my bosses are expecting banquet revenue out of this somehow as well. She kept pressing me that she just needs a yes or no and I kept trying to explain the situation in hopes that she may let me off the hook.Eventually after a tense conversation I said no not right now I can’t risk losing 2 weeks worth of something extremely profitable because I have 2 days of your event and she wasn’t mad but there was tension. She said the way I handled it she just would have preferred a direct answer but it’s very hard to say no to your girlfriend of 7 years.  It is my job to make as much money as possible and it is not a huge conference center with 20 different spaces we only have 3.Am I the asshole for not being direct ?

I will tell my kids “no” and mom will say “its fine, let them do it.”My mom knows that we will not allow Arya to have a cell phone until she is at least 12 yo for various reasons. About a year ago, my mom gave Arya an old cell phone of hers to play with. I didn’t like it, but I conceded and said “no internet.” I found out my mom had given Arya internet. I said I didn't like it. I told Arya she wasn’t allowed to have internet at home but she could still play on the phone. Arya connected the phone to the internet using the WiFi password I have in a frame in the guest bedroom - my mistake. Arya spent her time on the phone watching YouTube (not allowed activity). I explained it was warning one and she wasn’t allowed on it and to get off. I caught her a third time and I took away the phone indefinitely. My mom knew I wasn’t happy that she started this whole thing, but I let it go because Arya was the one who made the series of bad choices. Clearly a sign she wasn’t ready for a phone.I had radio silence from my mom for 24 hrs. I called her calmly and said that I would like to hear what happened from my mom's point of view. She got defensive. She explained what she told my daughter to do with the situation and said they had a talk with her about how it was wrong. Never once telling her to talk to me. I told her I understand why she didn’t give me a heads up but that I expected her to at least tell her to come to us and accept responsibility, not hide it and continue to lie about it. We went back and forth about it until finally my mom said “its just a f—king phone” and that’s when I lost my temper. I reminded her that I didnt want Arya to have the phone in the first place. I told her she's teaching Arya that it’s okay to lie to me and she doesn’t have to listen to me, “because you don’t either and that’s why I’m pissed” and I hung up.

I was grabbing drinks with a friend, she is curious about autism (suspects that she may be as well), I realised I never really talked to my ex about it. I was open about my mental and physical health (I spent a good chunk of my childhood in Hospital due to this I do have quite a bit of trauma, and I am hesitant to have biological kids but not against donation or adoption). I will admit I never brought it up specifically due to the stigma around it, but it also was never an issue afaik during the relationship. Hearing this my friend was a bit upset, understanding but did say it was a bit of a dick move lie by omission by it, and I am fully willing to admit that it was exactly that, lying. I never went out of my way to hide it and if I was ever asked directly I would've admitted it, but I need to know if I was the asshole for omitting this to my ex and if I should disclose it in the future to partners.Quick edit just to clarify some questions I imagine people would have: I am very high functioning autistic, it was only diagnosed as a side to my PTSD diagnosis (which I did inform her about) and have never had any of the stereotypical ASD tantrums or anything, the only obvious signs are intense special interests and a career in the tech industry. This might be a bit of an excuse but it was a recurring theme where she admitted of the two of us I was probably the one who had the greater emotional intelligence but I'll blame that more on a lifetime of therapy than my own abilities.",

I was anxious about opening them because I feel that she does not think of my interests or tastes when she shops. This makes me feel unseen/undervalued, especially since I am thoughtful when gifting to my family. I don't care about how much money people spend or about fancy things, but I do appreciate gifts with thought put into them. In comparison, I always send her flowers for her birthday/mothers day, and give her other gifts she seems to genuinely enjoy. I do not earn much but I do what I can, like most people.I opened them and sure enough I was disappointed. She had sent me some clothes that were clearly something she would wear. I felt like a bad person for being sad about it. 1. Because the clothes come from an expensive label. 2. Because it does not feel like I am being valued by this person. I struggled with the idea that it is not the first time this kind of thing has happened, which gave me more reason to believe that my mother may not care enough about me as an individual to put the thought in.A day after her package arrived my mother messaged.\"Did you like the clothes? I picked them all out myself!\"\"Yes, they are very colorful and will be good for summer.\" I replied.\"But do you like them?\"\"They're lovely gifts, thank you.\"\"Hmm. Next time I'll just get you a gift card then.\"She constantly gives the impression I should feel bad for not liking the same things she does and if i don't like her gifts.

I changed the topic after this as I did not want the stress of trying to navigate it.My question: Is there a way I could have handled this better without her responding this way?

I went to the shop the next day to talk to someone about an appointment, and I set up an appointment with the apprentice of the shop. She is a younger woman, who’s only been tattooing for a year. I come in a few weeks later, and my girlfriend insists she comes with. So I bring her with me, walk in, and the artist starts showing me the design she made for me, which I LOVED. My girlfriend chose to stay in the lobby while I get the tattoo done.So I sit down in the chair. And my artist strikes up a conversation. She asks the meaning of the tattoo, and I explain it, and I notice a Berserk painting, so I strike up a conversation about berserk. About twenty minutes into the tattoo, I get a text from my girlfriend, which said,”will you stop yapping? She doesn’t wanna hear your life story”. This bothers me a bit but she’s just sorta like that, so I apologize and sit quietly for a bit, but then the artist started asking about if I’ve read a certain comic book. And we start conversing again. About 10 minutes after that when the outline of the tattoo is done, the artist gets up to go grab my girlfriend out of the lobby, and she’s asleep, with her hands covering her ears. She comes back and explains, and I said,”she did say she was tired, I feel bad for dragging her along” despite her wanting to come with me.Before this next part, I will note that during conversation my artist brought up that she had a wife, so she was married, and not into dudes.After the tattoo is finished, I go out there and wake her up as I’m about to pay for the tattoo, and the artist told me it would cost 160. I was under the impression it would have been more of a 250 tattoo, so I tipped sixty dollars because the art was amazing, she was very quick, and the conversation she kept with me made me almost forget I was getting tattooed in the first place. Once we get back to the car, my girlfriend loses it, and essentially explains that a 60 dollar tip is for if you’re trying to fuck your artist, and that I needed to shut the fuck up because the artist didn’t even care and that I NEVER try to talk to her about the things I talked about with the artist (I have tried, she just has blatantly expressed annoyance and disinterest in said things), and even said that she was hoping I saw her hands covering her ears because it was so annoying for her.It’s been three days now, and she is still reminding me that I essentially cheated on her by tipping that much.

She has been texting us everyday wanting updates which can be exhausting  but my husband has taken the responsibility of most updates that way im not overwhelmed and stressed out. We had our conformation appointment a few days ago and my OB did prenatal labs and scheduled us in for an ultrasound. After the appointment, my husband texted my MIL and told her everything that happened in our group chat. She followed up by asking when the ultrasound is. I told my husband that she is going to ask if she can come. I have been up front about my boundaries and told him that I'm not comfortable with anyone other than him being in the room for appointments, ultrasounds, testing, and the birth. He has been accepting of this so I didnt think it was an issue. He texted my MIL back and told her when it was. She then asked if she could be there (like I said she would) and instead of giving her a firm no, he just told her about an office policy that only allows one person to come in with the patient. She then wanted him to record it or FaceTime her during. I know that technically isn't here physically being there but I would rather my husband be more present and not be on his phone or worrying about his mom at a time like that. She then sent a text that I read as passive aggressive about her just wanting to hear the heartbeat This is where I may be the asshole. I told him that I wouldn't be giving her anymore updates regarding me or the baby. She is getting too pushy and it is making me very uncomfortable because she is acting like its her baby. It upsets me to have to be that way with my MIL and my husband also thinks we can't stop telling her anything about the baby.. So AITA?Edit to add: My MIL also told someone that I didnt know before we even decided on having kids that when we do, she will be in the delivery room to cut the umbilical cord which is why I'm worried that if I don't stop her now, the situation will only escalate.Edit #2: I've been reading comments and I realized I didn't make this extremely clear. I have voiced boundaries to MIL before but she simply ignores me with small things like not going to dinner with her at FIL unless it comes from my husband. She doesn't respect boundaries with larger issues for anyone. I have 2 examples of this. 2 years ago she wanted to visit us for Christmas while we lived in another state but my husband and I had blackout dates with our jobs and we were both working 40+ hours a week for the entire month of December so we told her that we wouldn't be able to spend time with her because of our jobs so it wouldn't be good for her to come. She got upset (naturally) and told FIL about us \"not wanting to see her\" and he immediately booked them flights and a hotel for the entire month. She then got mad at us for not spending enough time with her. The second example was when we were planning our wedding and she took completely control of the guest list, seating chart, food, etc. (I wish that was an exaggeration) but the one thing that I did without her knowing or approval was buying my wedding dress. I booked a last minute appointment with out local bridal salon. I didnt plan it out. They just happened to have an opening the week before I left town for a business trip. She called me the day before i left to make an appointment to look at wedding dresses. When i told her i already bought my dress, she was very upset because i didnt include her. I just told her it was a spur of the moment situation and no one was there with me. She still thought she should have been told and i just told her that i just wanted to get the dress so i didnt have to worry about it later.. The week im out of town I found out she got her MOtG dress and it was nothing like we had discussed and I asked her why she didn't tell me she was getting her dress and she said it was a spur of the moment thing and she just wanted to go ahead and get it so she wouldn't have to do it later. This made me cry and feel very hurt because it seemed like she did that out of spite. When I told my husband about it, he immediately called his mom and said she would need to find a dress that was more like what we had discussed and she wouldn't be wearing that one because it really upset me that she went behind my back. The next morning, my FIL called my husband and told him that since the dress was paid for she would be wearing it and he didn't know why I was upset because it was \"just a dress\".

P said I wasn't outside, which...yes, I am? P then asked which house I was at, and when I said hers, she laughed and said they were at my mom's house, that she can't believe I went to her place. I hung up and haven't talked to her since.

So I don't feel terrible about not inviting him because frankly he wouldn't care either. But I'll be civil with him if I have to be around him.I still feel hurt that my sister hasn't apologized about it yet, and through my mother I've heard she feels like she shouldn't apologize. I even attempted to have the message relayed through my mom to my sister about me talking to her because I want my nephew to be my best man - I love him to death. To know he won't be there is devastating to me because he was my little buddy growing up and is becoming such a cool person. But P thinks I'm only reaching out because I want her to do my hair at the wedding, which she refuses to do, and I really couldn't care less if she did or not.I have decided to just not invite either of them to avoid any drama altogether, but my mom said she's upset that they won't be there. I'm currently rebuilding a relationship with my mother, so should I just bite the bullet and invite them for her sake? Or WIBTA for wanting to just block them out completely?EDIT: Hi, everyone! So I had a conversation with my fiancée and I can save everyone time and say I'm the AH. I'll let it go. I'll invite them both to the wedding. Thank you all for your input.",

The school has a block schedule, A days having my first 4 periods, and B days having my other 4. This last Monday was an A day, the day on which I have math class. I usually have about 30-60 minutes of homework every evening before A days. Also, my family has no designated “family time” and never has.It was Sunday night, and my family (dad, stepmom, stepsis) and I were watching the Obi Wan Kenobi star wars series, and had watched 2 episodes (a little over an hour of time) consecutively while/after eating dinner. After the 2nd episode, my dad turned off the TV (around 9pm), at which point I said I had homework to do, and went to my bedroom.Just shortly after doing so, I heard my stepmom practically yelling at my dad over her feeling like she was being ignored and her time not taken seriously. I also heard her saying that my dad should put me on a stricter homework schedule, regardless that I am a straight-A student (a point my dad brought up throughout their argument). My dad also said several times that “if this is how he (me) wants to manage his time, I can’t stop that”. My stepmom continued to argue, and state that she was extremely frustrated. My dad tried his best to diffuse the situation while still defending my decisions.After about 10 minutes of arguing, my dad eventually comes to my room and tells me to communicate with them about homework better, to which I said that I have always done this on Sundays when I have math the next day. He seemed like he agreed with my reasoning, but still just asked me nicely to communicate better in the future. I said that I would.I had completely finished my homework by 10pm, and had time to watch more star wars, but when I asked my stepmom, she acted cold towards me and was visibly angry. She ended up going to bed shortly after, and barely talked to my dad.She has started talking to me again, but I still feel like she’s giving me the cold shoulder, which I feel is silly for something like this, especially when she never even talked to me directly about it.TLDR: I did homework during “family time”, and my stepmom got extremely angry at my dad and I.AITA?",

	"body" : "I (40f) am mum to 3 kids. At the time of the conference they will be 6, 4 and 18 months.I need a certain amount of CPD each year to maintain my accreditations. I’ve struggled this last year, because mum duties have taken over work stuff. I’ve really had to wreck my business to keep my head above water with caring for the kids.My husband has always been a bit of a workaholic, but is currently getting really stressed with the pressure of earning enough money. We both run our own businesses. I’m keen to get my work back on track and stop him having to work so many hours, but that would entail him being able to commit to an afternoon of childcare a week and he won’t because he admits he would prioritise work if something went wrong, which would leave me having to cancel clients at the last minute.There is a three day conference coming up that I really want to go to. I’ve wanted to go for years, but it just hasn’t been possible. I initially asked in the family chat (his side of the family) if they felt between them they could cover three days. Everyone said yes.Then my husband found out that the event allows families to attend. Not the lectures etc. but to be on site. He wants to do that. I know partially so he can have a little holiday and spend time with the kids, but he admits also so he doesn’t have to do bedtime alone. He has never had all three alone for more than an hour or so. Not even sure he’s had the older two for a whole day without getting his parents to help.If he comes with, he’ll have three full days of childcare alone, but I’ll be there for bedtimes (though that will probably mean missing the social stuff in the evenings as bedtime might be prolonged away from home). If he stays home, he can have help any of the days and potentially the evenings too. Downside of staying home is that my parents may try to take over, which he rightly hates.Probably selfishly; I want a break. I have the full mental load with the kids. I’m trying to work and run a household. I’m hugely lucky we have my in-laws close. My parents are trickier, but they live with us and can be helpful. We can afford nursery one day a week. Any child free hours are spent either desperately trying to catch up on work or household stuff. A three day conference on my own sounds like bliss.WIBTA if I say I want to go alone?ETA: I think I’ve made him sound less competent than he is. He regularly has 1 or 2 of the kids for up to half a day. Just not all three. He used to do bedtime for the older two, but when I went back to doing some evenings after the 3rd was born, trying to do bedtime with a breastfed baby was too much. I dropped my evening work and it’s just become habit for me to do bedtime most of the time. He comes up if he’s back in time.UPDATE: I told him I’m booking it just for me, because I would have to miss out on the evening parts of the conference and because he would get more help at home. He immediately got angry, but I didn’t back down. As expected he threatened to work two of the days. I’ll organise his parents to have them both those days and overnight. If he changes his mind about working at least I know I’ve got them covered.",

Apparently Amy’s reasoning was that Jason had more experience (despite him and I being the same year and being in all the same classes— and me being the only one between us with any executive experience)I went along with it for the first half of my third year but it started to get bad. In 6 months we had 8 planned activities fall through. My policy is that we should plan and advertise events a minimum of 3 months in advance. Jason’s attitude was that it was always either too early or too late to plan anything. I was always the one stuck doing any paperwork and planning and eventually both me and the secretary got tired of it. I’d planned to quiet quit. Our union was supposed to be coordinating a festival for the city and I continued to work on that solo and wait to see if Jason would even call a meeting without me.The secretary on the other hand approached me to talk about just working around them and calling meetings ourselves. She also proposed at the meeting we called that we should open it to the members to re-elect the executive board (the original election consisted of just the 4 execs because it happened before classes started).the secretary and I discussed this on Monday and enacted the plan the Wednesday of the same week. Jason tended to be negligent in general but it seemed somewhat unfair. We only acted so quickly because we had already had to postpone a meeting with the city for a month and the festival is less than 3 months away.I know I’m not blameless in the union’s negligence though. On paper the president and I have the same authority. In practice though I found his consistent absence an obstacle when trying to get things done. A lot could have been solved earlier if I had have put the effort in as VP but I was more than content to watch him fail then deal with the aftermath.When we voted in the new executive board my election to presidency was unanimous but the atmosphere was tense and depressing. Jason usually had a tired defeated look on him but it was more apparent in this meeting. afterwards I felt so awful I went to my bed and cried.

We both live under my fathers roof & it was agreed that once we finish school we pay rent or move out. I haven’t finished school yet & I'm planning to go to college as well. My brother has been finished school for a while now &  he is jobless at the moment. He has his own family & my father told him and his gf(24) that he could live with us until he got his feet planted on the ground which is pretty understandable cuz he became a father at 21. The issue is that he has had his feet on the ground for a very long time & he had a position that payed very well & he made it clear to me the other day that he “has enough money to start a business” so it made question why he has the money for that but not the money to afford a mortgage. It’s no shocker he has money saved up because he doesn’t pay my father rent & neither does his gf. They live in the basement, 1 of the bedrooms was turned into a gaming room, my brother's bedroom was turned into their kids room & the guest bedroom is being used by my brother's girlfriend's sister(who also doesn’t pay rent) & then they turned the living room into their bedroom. So there’s not even enough rooms for all of them living down there. They leave messes in the kitchen & expect me to clean up after it. If I leave a plate or 2 in the sink he yells at me to clean it up but that means I have to clean their dishes so I've refused to clean them up a couple times. My father works week on week off & the house usually gets a big clean up before he’s home but they expect me to clean up all of upstairs even though i’m pretty much confined to my room everyday, i eat my meals in my room, i clean my messes up in the kitchen & so on. You might as well call me Cinderella at this point because all I do is clean up after everybody else. I love my brother & his family don’t get me wrong but it's unfair on me, i can’t have the kitchen between 5-7pm every night, if i want to clean my dishes i have to put all of theirs away so there’s room for mine, i have to be quiet in the evenings because their room has no walls and they can hear me. Me & my father had conversations about him moving out & my brother overheard me & my dad’s conversation, he later told me I was “stabbing him in the back” because I agreed with my dad kicking them out. I feel like an asshole agreeing with my dad but at the same time i think he’s old enough to move out & considering he said he has enough money to start a business i’m sure he won’t be homeless, there’s also 3 adults so i’m sure they could put their money together & buy a place. I honestly really wouldn’t have a problem with them if my brother didn’t try to parent me and speak to me like i’m less than him but it’s beginning to get to me, and even in situations where he’s wrong he and his gf will “gang up” on me.",

I (21f) met them through a friend (26f) who I lived with last year and this year until she moved back home permanently.Some background on their behaviour towards me, they have been very cold towards me, avoiding me, excluding me, and making fun of my behaviour behind my back to others (this behaviour was mainly just me self-isolating due to my struggle with my mental health and going through therapy again which was bringing up a lot of traumas I hadn't delt with enough). They have been comfortable \"borrowing\" my things and had been polite so I thought I was overthinking until someone made me aware of this. I brought up a conversation with all of them asking if I had done anything wrong, but they had no issues to bring up and made up excuses/ lies for their behaviour, which I didn't call out to avoid conflict.Without going into more detail about their behaviour towards me I'll just get to the beginning of what happened, While I was back home Carrie messaged me to ask when I was thinking of returning home to which I told her \"around the 2nd\". I ended up travelling back up on the 1st and when I had arrived back they saw me and panicked, Jack going up into my room to take their pet guinea pigs out of my room, leaving a lot of hay over my floor.I cleaned up the hay they had left on the floor and opened the window for the smell (the smell lingered for a week or two). I didn't immediately ask why they did that as I had a 4 hour drive up on little sleep and slightly hungover so I really just wanted to relax before going to bed.The next day there was a leak in the extension of the living room roof which I cleaned up and then went upstairs to take pictures of the roof from my room to send to the landlord. Jack and Carrie found the leak and immediately started blaming me to which I went downstairs to inform them I found that leak 2 minutes ago and that if they just looked in the pitcher they surely could tell how little water was in it.Now this is where maybe I'm an A-hole because it was poorly timed, I said \"I've been meaning to ask you, why you didn't ask to put the guinea pigs in my room?\" to which Carrie immediately said that now was not the time but I ignored her and continued on saying that if she had just asked I would've been fine with it. To which Jack responded with something like they took \"liberties\" which I snapped back at how disrespectful they have been towards me and that I've tried to communicate with them but they lack the ability to do the same. This angered both Carrie who made a dig at me for poor communication on the 2 minutes of me not telling them of the leak I cleaned up, and Jack as he was visibly frustrated and started yelling at me, \"I don't know you, I don't like you\" and referring to this question and the conversation I previously mentioned as me having \"another episode\".",

	"title" : "AITA for not hiring my friend after he helped me get a job?",
	"body" : "This happened a long time ago but still bothers me. About 10 years ago I was looking for a new job, and my best fried offered to introduce me to his Director at the company he worked at, as they were hiring. I interviewed, got the job and ended up working there for 3 years. During those 3 years, I worked really hard and was promoted a couple of times and eventually left for a manager position at new company.Shortly after that, my best friend got fired from his job for submitting some personal expenses for reimbursement, and he asked if I could hire him on my team as I had openings that matched his skill set and experience. However, my friend, who is very intelligent is also somewhat eccentric. He often would say and do things that are inappropriate at work. His work was generally fine, not outstanding, just ok, but he was enjoyed being the contrarian and the center of attention, often times in a cringy way. Also, given that we were best friend since childhood we tended to joke around a lot and he would generally bring out an immature side of me that I did not like, especially at work.So when he asked if I could hire him, I was very anxious about the idea of him reporting to me and weather he would take me seriously as a manager or continue acting unprofessionally and being provocative for the sake of attention. But initially, I went along with it and asked him to send me his resume, which he did. However it was a very half assed resume, filled with spelling errors, poor grammar and it was obvious he did not put a lot of effort into it.  I marked up all the errors and sent it back to him to correct, and I think he was kind of annoyed by this, and sent it back to me with only half the corrections done.At this point, I called him and told him that I could not hire him, because I did not think it would be good for me to be his direct manager given our friendship and the fact that had been fired from his previous role and that he refused to acknowledge that he made a mistake on the expense reimbursement (he unsuccessfully tried to sue his past employer for wrongful termination and refused to acknowledge that he violated a pretty black and white policy). This is what I told him, but in reality I was worried that his eccentricity would make me look bad, and if he did not take me seriously as a manager, it would set the wrong example for the rest of my team. Also I was annoyed that he would not put in the effort to make a good and professional resume.Needless to say, he was very hurt by this, and basically our friendship ended as a result of this. I ran into him on a couple of occasions over the years, and have reached out multiple times, but even 10 years later he is still angry about it, because he helped me get a job and I did not do the same for him.I miss my friend very much and think about him often. I had hoped we would stay friends for life, and that our kids could grow up together, but we just were never able to reconcile. Was I wrong?",

Since his death the relationship with my mom has become strained. My brother hasn’t had a thing to do with her since Jan 2021. My mom would pit us against one another. It was a habitual cycle of distrust and manipulation by her that we have since worked through. My brother, SIL, and I have a great relationship since my mom is no longer in the picture. She blames us for her not paying her mortgage that we never knew she wasn’t paying. After the auction, she then had 10 days to vacate. Within those 10 days, she talked to the new owner and gave him her sad story. He felt bad for her and made a deal for her stay there 3 months and get her the surplus money from the sale of the house. She was supposed to use that time to find a place, pack, and move. She didn’t do that. After she got the almost 40k from him and the 3 months were up she told him to talk to her lawyer. It then went to court- she lost. She had until the end of Nov to leave. In total she had 8 months to find a place and move as well as almost 40k but still did nothing. During this time she has withheld belongings that was supposed to go to my brother and I after my dad’s passing. She refused to give us anything and would constantly make comments like “You don’t know what it’s like. You only lost a father, I lost a husband. My lose is greater than yours”. Those hurt. Jan 2nd she called me to come get whatever I wanted because they were kicking her out. She went next door and talked to my brother through the doorcam and told him the same thing. So him and I both left work to finally get our families stuff. I was then told by her that anything I took was still hers and I was just holding it for her. I told her no. Her and I argued and I walked out of the house in tears because I was so hurt and mad. She tried to have us arrested for getting stuff even though she is the one who told us to. After my SIL told her that we had her recorded on the doorcam telling us to come get what we wanted, she relented. Even after all that, I still helped her move some stuff to a storage. She ended up at a shelter that would help her find a place to stay and work with her.

I thought she is no longer interested in the job I promised so I did not send her any message anymore.LENY didn't get the post near her hometown so LENY sent me a message just recently and asked me when I will be accepting applicants for the new post. I told LENY that I want to settle to the job first before I open the job vacancies (i don't even have my first salary yet). After I told LENY about that, LENY suddenly sent me long messages about her wanting to be near her aging parents and her health concerns. Her exact words in the end was \"If you don't  want to hire me, I can't do anything anymore MA'AM (MY NAME)\". I felt slighted by the tone of her message and the capslock that she used in her messages. I felt that she is angry so I stopped replying. Then she went on and on about how she is a good worker and how she had perfect attendance record (all of it, she sent in WhatsApp). I did not reply because I felt offended. I felt that she is pressuring me to open the vacancy when I am not yet ready to do it yet. I realized that even if she is not angry and I merely misunderstood her, I felt offended by her voluminous messages so I don't want to hire her anymore.The position she was aiming is a position of trust and confidence. I will be needing someone who will loyally assist me and will not betray the accounts we hold. The person that I need to hire have to be with me most of the time. By what LENY just did, I currently feel that she is not the proper person for the job. I felt turned off and I don't want to hire her anymore. It will be very awkward for me to hire her after that and I don't think I will have any peace of mind working with her.  AITA for changing my mind?TLDR, I promised someone who helped me before that I will hire her for a position of trust and confidence. She sent some messages which felt offensive to me and I felt that I cannot give that trust to her anymore so I now change my mind. AITA?EDITED the post to change the name to LENY (not her real name).",

	"title" : "AITA for guiding my brother to a better path?",
	"body" : "My brother (20M) has had a lifelong passion for singing and performing. He has grown up on school stages and sings at family gatherings. The problem is- he's really bad it. He's screechy and off-key. I (18M) can tell that everyone in the room is uncomfortable when he sings, but they still shower him with praise and give him false hope that inflates his ego and makes him think that he's the most musically gifted person in the world when he's far from it and is only going to get hurt once he actually tries to make it in showbiz. I've always been quietly afraid he'd fly too close to the sun.Well, my fears came true today. He stormed into the living room wearing- get this- a clown costume. Blue hair, red nose, jumpsuit, the whole nine yards. He looks ridiculous, to say the least. I ask him about it, and he tells me he was trying to be \"memorable\" at the singing competition audition he just came back from. He was storming around the place all angry because the judges told him he was too pitchy and sounded like he was bleating like a goat, just like I had been thinking for all these years. Still, he refused to believe the judges' feedback, insisting that he \"nailed it\" and that some people \"just aren't ready for me\".I take a few deep breaths to keep my cool, and point out that these judges actually work with singers, so shouldn't they know what they were talking about? My brother starts yelling at me about how I'm \"taking their side\" and \"unsympathetic\" (when I'm just trying to understand why he doesn't believe the judges), and about how accusing someone of singing like a goat is \"morally wrong\".So I break the news to him so that he doesn't keep chasing this pipe dream for the rest of his life: he's a bad singer. I brace myself for him to start crying or something, but instead he accuses me of being jealous of his dream (when I have never shown an interest in the performing arts), calls my dream of becoming a computer programmer stupid (when I, unlike him, have shown skill in that area) and accuses me of betraying him.So I let him perform his song in front of me to see for myself how he did. And it's... bad. It's very bad. It sounds like the last sounds of a dying animal in heat- and I tell him this, very honestly, with the best intentions, as gently as I can while in the throes of some major secondhand embarrassment.And he takes it. He backs down somehow, as if my advice has flipped a switch in his brain. He starts ranting about how his inner voice was right all along and how he needs to find a new dream. I know I should be relieved. I even help him decide on a new career path (a computer programmer, which he called stupid just two minutes before). I should be happy, but I only feel guilty seeing how dejected I made my brother. I know I only told him the truth and ultimately set him on a better life path, but I still feel bad. AITA?",

	"body" : "TL;DR: Getting into arguments with my partner over her use of pre-workout without asking. AITA?CONTEXT/BACKSTORY: My partner(30f) and I(31m) have been getting into arguments over the usage of pre-workout for exercise. She practices yoga/ballet 5 days a week while I do typical weight lifting 3 days a week. I started to use pre-workout supplements to give myself an extra boost for my workouts. She tried it for energy with her exercise. I did not want her to use it frequently due to the high amounts of caffeine pre-workout can contain.Eventually, she began drinking the pre-workout I'd buy before her ballet lessons without letting me know, which annoyed me since she would use it without asking. While it would eventually be replaced, it was frustrating preparing for my routine, only to find that the container had significantly less powder than when I last used it, sometimes being near empty. Additionally, I had been working on our shared finances and was trying to maintain our budget and each container costs ~$20-$30, so I didn't want to have to frequently buy it.With the last container I purchased, I told her it was exclusively for me because I didn't think it was right for her to be drinking multiple energy drinks + take pre-workout. She has asked a few times to use it and I said yes whe she did ask, but recently she has been using it without asking. She never denies it when I ask, but I specifically bought this one just for me, and finding that she's using it without asking is upsetting because she would previously use the majority of it. This issue is popping back up because while the both of us had taken breaks from our exercise, we are both getting back into our routines (Her with ballet/yoga, me with weight lifting).We agreed to take it to the Internet counsel to settle the matter for us both.Her exact stance is\"It's a communal food item that I replace every time it's empty. You are never without it when you want to use it. It is not fair that I'm not allowed to use something we BOTH consume simply because you want to save your portion for a special time. If it's being replaced, and you do not have to go without, how much and how often I consume it is irrelevant.\"I don't see it as a communal food item since I've been purchasing it to specifically assist with my workouts. She compares it to buying food that sits in the fridge that someone else ends up eating after a while, meaning to her it should have been eaten sooner/earlier. I compare it to me using her makeup without asking(I don't actually) and using all of a certain product without her knowledge, only to find out its gone when she's trying to get dressed up. AITA for calling it out and getting upset when she uses it without asking or is she in the right?Edit: so people know this isn’t a serious or major fight between the two of us. Just something we keep butting heads over. Feel free to ask for additional info. We’re both going to go over it tonight when she’s off workEdit 2: Showed my partner the responses. She acknowledged that she doesn’t always replace it despite claiming so but agreed with me it doesn’t matter in the end. I’m just going to continue to purchase preworkout and treat it communally.She also was surprised everyone considered me controlling when she told me that she stopped because she found out she was drinking unsafe/lethal doses of caffeine. Her words and her research. I had already stopped complaining about it by the point she looked it up.I’m still the asshole according to public opinion though so there ya go.

	"title" : "AITA for using a cosplayers handle in my videos aswell as responding to another content creator when talking about it",
	"body" : "Context: I am a cosplayer I make videos and post them to Tiktok In August 2022 I had bought tickets to a convention in London taking place in October. I had decided to make a cosplay of a cosplayer that was pretty well known of as I had enjoyed their cosplays for months before, Whilst I was creating this cosplay I found out the cosplayer was actually a moderator to a discord server talking about a meetup to the same convention I was going to, on top of that they had put a public invite out in one of their videos so anyone could join, and in a heartbeat I joined and had told them in a general chat they I was cosplaying their character from one of their series. It took until basically the last few days I had left to complete the cosplay but I finished it and was actually able to meet up with the cosplayer that I was cosplaying. they had asked me for a photo and even dm'd me asking for my Instagram handle so they could tag me in a photo. I was 15 and they were in their 20s at this point.Anyway a couple months pass and I had forgotten about the cosplay until February (I was 16 now as my birthday was in January) so I thought why not use the cosplay in videos so I made a bunch of videos that were basically referencing the cosplay and where it was from and a bunch of that stuff. Now whilst making these videos I had been using a hashtag that was their Tiktok handle. I didn't even realise I was doing it until it was pointed out to me so I clicked on the hashtag and realised that I was the only person using it, and had technically taken it over, so I posted a video joking about it and moved on. Well a couple weeks later and another content creator who was a friend of the cosplayer had seen my video and made a response to it, it wasn't anything serious but to sum it up, it was basically a call out post saying that they were going to try and take the hashtag over, they also said that they were asked to do this by the cosplayer. They didn't mention me by name but because I had like 20 posts on the hashtag is was pretty blatant that they were referring to me.Now I made a jokey response to the video basically saying that this would be a war that I would definitely lose in seeing as I had like 100 followers and they had multiple thousands, a few hours later I deleted the video as it felt kinda rushed and I didn't like it (it was rushed). I also commented on their video because I wanted them to know I had seen it. The following weekend they deleted my comment, and had blocked me on both of their accounts. I was a little upset because I had watched their content aswell in late 2020 but I got over it as the weekend passed. Then during the next week the cosplayer had also blocked me now this hit me hard and I won't lie I skipped school and kinda just cried it off for the whole day.So AITA",

I decided to try to get into tech and was able to find a job that pays well for my area and doesn't care that I don't have much in the way of education, certs, or experience in exchange for doing low level work (I'm pretty much pulling cables + some customer service).I'm now a little more than a month in and I'm finding I actually enjoy the work more than I thought (electrical circuits are neat!) and I'm considering staying at this level and really working on these skills. Also, my new co-workers are all actually pretty great. The manager actually cares about the team and does as much as she can to support us. Just about everyone is friendly and willing to help me out as much as they can.The bad news is that the job is with a big company and the owners are far more interested in trying to squeeze as much money out of this corporation as they can. It's mostly typical American corporate standard BS, way understaffed, very little training or resources, sales doing all kinds of shady shit, outsourcing, high turnover, etc. There's no way I can stay here without getting totally burnt out in a year.I'm seriously considering seeing if I can get in with our local union, if I do I'd have to quit my current job. They are already understaffed and there's a hiring freeze, if I go they could get stuck in an even worse position. I'd feel like a bit of a dick leaving them like this. Especially since I'm not like who they usually hire and the manager kind of took a chance on me.TLDR: started a job in a totally new field, realized I actually like it and the co-workers are great but the employer sucks balls, so I'm considering quiting.Will I be the asshole if I leave?

Saw her through hospital visits, her dad lent on me at her funeral for music, eulogy, invites  etc. He moved to oz soon after but we always kept in contact.  Her death impacted me profoundly.Fast forward 13 years I got a job offer in oz, upon my arrival he really helped out. One of those things he helped out was was finding me a car. He insisted, and I was willing to take it as if never been in the country before. He took me to car dealerships and when I decided on a car I went to the finance person to organise buying and the payments were too high. I said no it’s not viable  and he off his own back said he would pay a deposit. I was taken a back but this was a few days after landing, jet lag and worrying about having to get a car to get to my new job so I let him. I said after let’s set up a payment plan he said not to worry about it now . It was left as that.Fast forward since then I had been round his numerous times, upgraded my car took it over to show him, he got remarried I was invited etc.When covid hit it changed everything and he never called me or vice versa. When covid finished he went off travelling as did I and well our paths never crossed as his new partners son had a grandchild and I got into a relationship.Our relationship pretty much ceased to exist but I did of course invite him and his partner to my wedding where we are only having 30 people.He responded saying he couldn’t make it.It’s 8 years since I’ve been here and 3 weeks before my wedding and he has my number.Yet he chose to message me on Facebook including my mum stating the “agreed loan amount for the car”, saying he thought of himself as a surrogate parent (I have 2 alive parents) at the time but the relationship wasn’t maintained. Then stating he would “ wipe” the debt as a parting wedding present!Safe to say I was shocked and upset by it all. I’ve never taken money for a loan from anyone besides my parents and well I believed he wanted me to have it as gift to begin with as he never stated at any point he wanted it back. Also why not mention it for 8 years!Anyhow I was so annoyed I told him as such, to  include my mum in such a message written with such umbrage and Why would I want to start a marriage with money not given with the best intent, I asked his account details and paid him back the money immediately.He responded with “unnecessary but Thankyou”.I wanted to respond but refrained and I have nothing good to say.By the way he has plenty of money, so his fine on that front.I’m just so hurt by his actions. I really appreciated everything he did outside of the money when I first came over and now it’s all tainted. I’m out of pocket just before my wedding and just feel like my integrity got bought into question.Did I do wrong?",

We are no longer roommates as they couldn't afford to go to college. I had been the one to move in with them bc we had become friends during our first semester. The first half of us living together was great, we hung out and got along well. The following semester is when problems arose. Between the time of our freshman year ending and our sophomore year starting, they got into a long distance relationship and got engaged. Keep in mind our break is only about five months, personally I think that's a little fast but it's none of my business. They began to essentially completely ignore my existence. They would be on call with their fiance (18F) 24/7, even being on call during classes and going to sleep. I could never tell if they would talk to me or their fiance half the time. We no longer went out, no longer had our usual movie nights. The only time we did things together was cooking dinner, but of course, they were on call with their fiance. As the months went on, I just gave up on trying to spend time or go out with them because no matter what, I would be the third wheel. To me, they seem overly dependent on each other to the point where it's becoming unhealthy. I never tried to bring it up because I didn't know how to say \"Hey, break up with your fiance because I want attention.\" I have nothing against the fiance, I was able to meet them in person when they visited in person. One thing that really irked me is that I had asked them to watch a show with me, she said no, which I said fine and went about my life. Then, some time later, I come back to the room to them watching the same show (With you guessed it, the fiance!). It sort of felt like a slap in the face, since this was also one of my favorite shows. A similar thing happened when I asked to play a video game with them, except this time they said yes, then proceeded to not play with me and started playing with them instead. I started growing more and more resentment for my roommate and the relationship.They had almost broken up, I felt guilty for wishing that it actually happened. At the end of the year, I moved out of the dorms for a break and they text me out of the blue asking me if anything was wrong. Not wanting to lie, I explained (mostly) everything about how I felt ignored and that I felt like I was only in the dorm to sleep and not actually \"live\" there. I didn't bring up my feelings about the relationship itself. They respond back, apologizing, but saying that I had been \"pushing away\" from them and that they had been actually trying to hang out with me this whole time! I hold my tongue so that the conversation can just get over with, but now I'm feeling like I should have brought it up in the conversation. AITA for feeling this way about this relationship?",

	"body" : "So, I'm the singer in a rock cover band on my college campus. We've faced drummer challenges since our inception last semester. The initial drummer quit before practices began, the second ghosted us, and after a period of playing shows with fill-ins, we found a promising replacement. Initially, things went well despite his busy schedule. However, he now struggles to attend practices and alters the tempos of songs during shows, which leads to us sounding very sloppy.Usually, we learn about two songs for a new show, as we like to keep things fresh, and phase out songs the crowd doesn't vibe with. We agreed to learn six new songs during Christmas break for a show. Despite a month's preparation, our drummer faced difficulties, often glancing at the songs during practice and leaving early. He joined another band, encountering the same issues, which turned what was supposed to be their awesome debut performance and our \"we're back\" show into a shitshow. He can't keep the same bpm throughout a song, he doesn't play the songs correctly, etc.We're frustrated with the drummer's inconsistency, so my band quietly started searching for a replacement. I tried explaining maybe staying in the other band (which is more his genre than what we play) would be best, but that didn't go well. Currently, efforts to persuade him to focus solely on the other band have been challenging. Two of us are leading discussions, keeping the other members out to avoid unnecessary conflicts. However, they agree with us on the matter.Despite our drummer being a great guy, we prioritize finding someone who can maintain timing, play songs accurately, and commit time.Sidenote, we used his designed logo for merch. Although we told him we would toss out items featuring his design, he felt used. We value him but require a drummer aligned with our musical goals. We also started writing original music, but he hasn't contributed anything yet.So tell me...

We never had a lease, because she wanted to be able to kick me out in case I was a bad roommate, and I was fine with that, because I also wanted the ability to leave whenever I wanted. Well recently she kicked me out unceremoniously when I came home after spending the day at my parents. Her reasoning was that I never did anything. I never cleaned, I never did the dishes or vacuumed, she said I wasn't \"ready to be a roommate\" and I wasn't doing anything to help her mental health.I felt really bad because that sounds like I really was terrible to live with, but then I thought about it. I really didn't do anything, including contribute to the mess. None of the mess was mine. Our apartment looked like a disaster constantly, there were always clothes everywhere, there were always dishes piled up in the sink, and none of it was ever mine. I was never really home, because I'd always be working or hanging out with friends, it was very rare that I spent a day in the apartment, but when I did, I'd do my laundry and I'd always put it away. When I cooked, I never left my dishes out. I would always wash them in the crowded sink, and when the dishwasher was full (every time) I would wash my dishes by hand. The apartment looked horrible, and I contributed to none of it. I wasn't even really allowed in the main spaces anyway. When I tried to put my own stuff out, she'd say I needed to put it away or her cats would vomit on it, which I get isn't her fault, but it kind of further marked her territory to say \"this is not your space.\" And when I did finally get some furniture that was mine, she would tell me I need to put it in my room or get rid of it because there was no space among the disaster we were living in. All I had was my bedroom, yet she wanted me to clean up her mess in the space I wasn't allowed in.I asked why she never brought up to me that she wanted me to clean more, and she replied she \"shouldn't have to mother me,\" which I understand, but I also don't get how I could have known?

I never asked her to do my dishes, or pick up my laundry (because it was always in my room) so I don't get if I should have just known? I can't vacuum the floor if it's covered in her yarn, I can't wipe down the counters when there's dried pasta noodles stuck to the surface, and cereal boxes stacked up, but maybe that's just a thing everybody knows? Like is part of being a roommate picking up after the person you're living with? Because I was under the impression it was like a \"carry your own weight, and help if they ever ask you to\" (she would occasionally ask me to tackle her mountain of dishes in the sink, and I always would, but if I'm not asked to, then I'm gonna assume you'll do it, because they're all your dishes)AITA?

We are very close with an engaged couple (25M, 26F) who are also friends of ours from college. The five of us spend a lot of time together.In general, I would say I am by far the most interested in trying new things, such as new and interesting activities, or new places to go out to eat. The other four generally like to do the same types of things. This is especially true for the engaged couple. As far as hangouts go, they almost always would like to have us at their place, have drinks, and play a board game called betrayal at the house on the hill. For going out to eat, the engaged couple are especially passionate about two restaurants in our town and always want to go there. One, called Hip-stir, is generally pretty good. The other one, called goldfinch, is generally not a very good restaurant. The roomies agree.Tonight, the guys plan to go out to eat. All three of the roomies say in the chat that we want to go to a specific restaurant, nice sports bar type place to watch an nfl playoff game. The engaged guy says he wants to go goldfinch because they have a special this weekend that he wanted. Both of the roomies cave and say we can go there as long as we can see a tv. I call them because we were all on the same page about not wanting to go there. They say they don’t want to be the bad guy, but if I say something they’ll back me. I respond to the chat saying that I would still vote for the other place as I don’t think goldfinch has very good food, and asked if the engaged guy would consider a new place and maybe get the special tomorrow. A little while later, he responds and says that he is really not feeling bar food and would rather join us after if we decide to eat there.Knowing I’d lost the roomies, I finally just said I’d go to goldfinch. However, I think it’s very dumb. I know it seems tacky, but it’s sort of the tip of the iceberg for what I feel a lot of the time.WIBTA if I made a stand today and said I didn’t want to spend $20+ at a place that 3 out of the 4 of us would rather not go to, and 1 (me) is very opposed to?

I do understand what he is going thru, I myself quit smoking a year ago and went thru similar things. I do feel like I handled my anger better in that time and have been better about how I react since then. I picked up extra hours at work this week since he’s in between jobs. I also have a lot going on like a death in the family I found out today and having to talk to detectives about trauma I went thru as a child; that I had the courage to finally talk about and name my abuser. Not to mention doing school and working a full time job. Today we went to my sisters house to visit and saw my nephew. When I was playing with my nephew my bf told me that my sisters husband kept staring at my butt. He told me this when we left their house. He has had issues with this in the past and wants me to change what I wear. He thinks that I show off my body all the time and it’s disrespectful to him and disrespectful how other men look at me. He said that if I loved him like I say I do that I’d be willing to wear baggy clothes and longer shirts that cover my figure. For those wondering I was wearing a grey sweatshirt and leggings. I had enough from everything going on this week and told him how I feel like it’s so difficult to communicate even before him quitting weed. When I try to communicate how I feel it becomes to a bigger fight when I want to talk it out. Like how he gets mad for what I wear and how other men look at me (trust me I don’t enjoy it) I told him multiple times in the past that my pants just don’t fit me rn and I’d like to go to the gym but he doesn’t want me going since other men look at me and I’d like to get new pants but I can’t really afford alot. I also communicated that it sucks how I have been going thru alot this week and am being there for him and he can’t be there for me and has been making me feel like poop for the whole week when I already am depressed.

So I accepted. (This was on Tuesday)Since they insisted multiple times that I apply, I figured they’d be happy when I told them. I was incorrect.They’re giving mixed messages since I called them and told them I got the job. At first they were happy for me but their tone was off. They kept seeming more weird so I asked if they were okay. they said that they’ve been having reservations on whether they should have told me about the job or not (reminder: they sent this over a month ago). they are worried us working together might be a bad idea and that our friendship will blow up and then it will be awkward at work. (My friend has a history of tumultuous relationships. I like them a lot but have bad luck with friendships).I tried to assure them tht it would b ok. We don’t have a history of drama (though we’ve only been friends around 6 m, and I do NOT do drama. it causes me so much distress. I have never had a friendship “blow up.”I thought everything was ok but then when we were texting the next day (Wed) they brought up more of their reservations.For context, my friend has mentioned multiple times that they’d like to kiss me (they casually make out with some of their friends). There’s not anything wrong with that, but I’m just not a “make out with my friends” sort of person so I’ve said no every time. I’m not very big on physical contact for various reasons. But, I do cuddle with them because I know that physical touch is their love language and I do like it because I’m comfortable with them.Anyway, when texting they said “i have a rule that I don’t kiss coworkers, so if you ever want to take me up on the kiss thing it’ll have to be before you start working here.” And that they’d have to think on cuddling. I told them I thought that was understandable and to lmk what they’re comfy with.While on the topic of work/friendship, I said I think we should try to keep work talk at a min outside of work.They then said they didn’t have enough energy for this and that they were going to bed and abruptly ended the convo.They had a 12 hr day so it I makes sense that they’re tired. I thought they’d reach out the next day when they were rested. They did not.Its been 2 days. Idk what to do.AITA? I think I fucked up somehow but idk what I did.

I do keep him around in case he finally comes around and give me the money deserve. Whenever I speak about getting me the money or even getting me a rental it's always some excuse.

It's very upsetting because i've been on my own since 18 I worked really hard to get and maintain that car and to just see it get taken away from the hands of someone else really hurt me. After losing my car I was in a serious car accident in a lyft that stop me from working.

We all live together as we moved from our country to another country and rent is high so it is better for us to live together. He moved here about year and half ago and we have THREE dogs. I work full time, study part time, my bf works full time and after his work he does some deliveries as a side income. My mom is currently not working due to health issues. I am not some clean freak, but I like my house to be clean and tidy. Having 3 dogs means house needs to be maintained. When we are at work my mom does a little bit around the house. When I come home I cook, clean around the kitchen, feed dogs etc. My bf is the type of person who needs to be told what to do ( even he says he isnt), but I feel like he does not see things that need to be done. EVERY weekend I am cooking, cleaning, doing laundry, cleaning our bedroom etc.. We walk our dogs together on weekend. Now the issue is that every time when he comes home from work he opens a beer and smokes a happy cigarette (ya know what I mean) and after that he plays fortnite or watches yt. He says he needs some time for himself and that happens on the weekend too. He sleeps till 2-3 pm, wakes up, smokes, eats, watches yt and if scheduled for that day ( which is not every day nor every weekend ) he goes and does delieveries. I get that he works a lot and that he is tired, but I also work and I study. I dont have \"me time\" on the weekends or during a week. This has been going on for a year and half now, and three weeks ago he said that he is scheduled for only two days to do deliveries and that he will do more around the house and take care of dogs... he did nothing.. so on Sunday I made lunch and he woke up at 2 pm and ate.. I asked if he will take dogs for a walk and he said that he just ate and that he will relax and go to work. I got pissed off and stopped talking to him ( its Friday now) for five days now.

I asked if one friend could do the dishes while I cook so it wouldn’t be messy and he agreed. I was thankful and the time went on. Being teens we obviously did some things like wrestling and others but only stuff most teen boys would do even if they were responsible. we watched a movie for a little bit but got bored and decided to play hide and seek. My friend who cleaned the dishes seeked first and it was a normal game. However this is when the issue began. I was the seeker next and waited for them to say they were ready.

One of them texted saying “it’s cold out here… near the front” knowing it was probably a trick I checked anyway and as I did heard them running up the stairs to my room.

They told me go to the basement and FaceTime them so they can leave the room and rehide. I agreed and did. But when they “rehid” they ended up running out of the house. I searched for them in the neighborhood for a good 10 minutes before going back inside and locking the door and screen door. They came back telling me to open the door and I didn’t. They left some of their items in the house and while I had no intention of keeping them I waited a bit. I gave 2 of the items back of my balcony. The 3rd item they told me leave it outside the door I don’t want to see your face. They seemed to be frustrated but at that point I didn’t care. I went to open the front door and when I did one of them ran inside and grabbed my arm. I ran upstairs to my room and locked the door but didn’t know a way to continue from there. they got into my room and started an argument with me saying that I’m trying to act the victim and that I was wrong. I argued back saying that I let them into my home and all I asked was to not do anything dumb. They said I was being a part of it by wrestling them and that locking me out of my room was a part of the game and I never told them to stop. I get where they’re coming from but I felt disrespected when I let them come over and fed them.

My little sister Charlotte and I didn't know we even had an older sister until I was 19 and she was 17 so we didn't really get a chance to have a relationship with Sammi, which we feel really awful about. Sammi's mother died when she was born and we are unsure if she is even our sister as she may possibly have a different father but she looks so much like my Dad, he is most likely her parent and she has no other family and has been there for her, especially recently. She doesn't have much family and has two young boys. Dad loves those boys and is there for them as much as he can be.My mother is against this.

She even got annoyed when Sammi told a teacher she knew that her son was my dad's grandchild! She went on about how my sister is bad and how the children will be the same way so we should keep our distance (one of them is only 3!). She said that I was wrong for even wanting to have Sammi or her kids around.I understand my mum doesn't want to be involved with a bad crowd, but her animosity towards my sister should not stop my Dad from spending time with his grandchildren, or make me almost feel guilty for even talking with my sister. they have just as much right to come to spend time with Dad as my niece Callie.

I started to wobble and was about to pass out when I was laid down and my instructor called an ambulance.My dad came to pick me up and we talked on the way home. he comforted me, he doesn't talk much but he told me that having anxiety can happen and he too went to a psychologist for this reason. I didn't mind his suggestion but we left it there.After two hours my mother called me to \"talk\". when I told her about my anxiety she started yelling at me. She loves to throw in my face that I can't be stressed because tutoring and working part-time as a babysitter isn't a real job (I do it to pay for college and my license). Nothing I'm not used to so I let her go on.She moved on to my social life.

At that moment I asked her \"Are you describing yourself? Are you sure these are not your friends? Don't you have a little shame? I would pay to see the faces of the people around you\".She responded by insisting that this rude attitude of mine is the reason why I have no friends and why we don't talk anymore like when I was younger. I replied that the reason why we don't talk is because she always has a joke about my appearance or some negative comment, criticism about how I am a failure and a disappointment. The one time I trusted her was enough for me to learn not to.Before ending the call I told her \"This way you carry yourself is why we are all happy when you go to the gym, so Dad, Denis and I can have fun and spend quality time with each other\".I thought my dad would be on my side after hearing my side. (I've learned by now that any call I have with her I have to record so she can't try to set me up once she talks to the family) But my dad said something that made me think I might be in the wrong.

Once in a while, when I find a song that really resonates with me/a song that I think she might enjoy, I will offer her my earpieces and ask her to listen to it.I’m aware that we like different things, and I’m okay with that. However, she will constantly tell me that she’s “tone deaf,” and music doesn’t really do anything for her to avoid listening to it. I don’t expect her to share my love for music, but I want her to at least give my recommendation a listen!Earlier, when I recommended her to watch a TikTok that I found really funny, she only watched it for a grand total of 3 seconds before deciding that it was unfunny. The clip was only 20 seconds long, and she didn’t even get to the funny part yet! I get that we find different things funny, but you can’t even watch a 20 second clip?On the other hand, whenever she’s watching a horror movie (I dislike the genre) or a reality TV show that I’m not very interested in, I’ll try my best to learn more about them and watch a few episodes with her. Even if I don’t love her interests, I actively put in effort and keep my mind open, which sometimes leads to me genuinely enjoying the shows that she’s watching.She doesn’t ask me to be interested in whatever she’s watching, and I choose to put in effort of my own volition. I care about her, so I put in effort into learning about her interests. I don’t expect my mom to fall in love with my interests, or actively learn about them. But at the very least, she doesn’t have to immediately dismiss me and be closed-minded about it! From my pov, relationships should be a give and take.After she refused to watch the 20 second, TikTok I got upset and told her that she should at least care a little about something I’m showing her. She responded by saying that I “just have to accept that we like different things, and that you can’t force me to like what you like.” The thing is, I DO accept that we are different, and I have never forced her into liking anything! All I’m asking for is a bit of reciprocation and basic respect for my interests.Please tell me, AITA? I honestly feel quite guilty for being upset.",

I don’t know if it’s gold plated, and now I’m wondering if the diamonds are real because I’m not sure if they even put diamonds in silver rings.

Her interest in medicine started when she was very young after I was babysitting her and Chloe and she saw all the books and anatomical displays in my office (I’m a Cardiologist). Just over a year ago, Tanha asked if I would be interested in adopting Jasmine as she couldn’t keep up with trying to raise two kids. I said I would only agree if that was what Jasmine wanted, I didn’t want to make such a change without her input. She was 14, not two. Jasmine was overjoyed and eagerly agreed to the adoption; I did make sure to have her in therapy. Here is where I may be the AH. Four months ago, a position opened up in Sweden. I talked it over with Jasmine and she was super excited and it would also put her in far better schools. So, after getting my work visa and filling out the paperwork we prepared for the move. Jasmine was chattering to all of her teachers and classmates about the move, and it did draw quite a lot of attention to her. I later had an angry Tanha, Jason and Chloe on my doorstep. They demanded to know why I was moving their daughter away from her family across the world, and throwing so much money on her education, clothing and electronics when I didn’t do the same for Chloe. I got mad, and this is where I may have overstepped. I snapped that they’d lost their right to claim Jasmine when they neglected her and threw her to the side just because Tanha couldn’t handle the fact that she and Chloe had twin siblings. That Jasmine deserved her chance to make her life the way she wanted it and that Tanha and Jason spoiled Chloe more than I ever did. So yes, I was favoring Jasmine because she needed someone on her side. Tahna broke down in tears, Chloe doing the same while sobbing and crying out that I hated her before they left as Jason called me a bitch for destroying his family. We didn’t hear anything more from them as we packed, and we moved three months ago. Jasmine thankfully wasn’t home for that conversation though I did tell her as I don’t believe in keeping secrets like that when she had a right to know. She cried but thanked me for not giving up on her or forgetting her. I’ve gotten several calls from our extended family berating me for moving and tearing Jasmine from her family calling me selfish and cold. I can’t help but worry I went too far. Am I an asshole?",

(M60s) owns several shoe stores so he only comes around once a week or so and I don't know him super well. The store I work at has three employees and by random coincidence we're all in our late 20s-early 30s so we get along pretty well. I assume that's why our boss's wife, Mrs B. (F, I wanna say late30s-early40s?), likes to hang around at this store more. She usually comes here a few days a week without her husband and I wouldn't say we're friends with her but we're friendly. She's kind of a character - almost a caricature of a rich person that's completely disconnected from reality but she's nice enough. Here's where it gets tricky: Mrs B. loves to flirt. She didn't exactly marry for love if you get my drift and while Mr B. knows that she comes to the store he definitely doesn't know that she meets guys there and sometimes even leaves with them and only comes back a few hours later. None of us have told her husband, we just mind our own business.The issue is that me and my boyfriend ran into one of my co-workers (I guess I'll call her Gayle) while grocery shopping the other day and Gayle ended up jokingly mentioning Mrs B. and her 'guys.' I don't even remember what she said exactly but once Gayle and her husband left my boyfriend asked me what she meant by that so I told him about the secret rendezvous and he said I needed to tell Mr B. because he deserves to know.

He's decided that it speaks badly to my character or that it means I think cheating is okay or something.

My rental home was too far away from my ex's workplace so we found a new rental house. In my country, normally, the renter does the painting or wallpaper themselves as well as laying laminate( or other flooring) themselves. Luckily we both have family that wanted to help and I planned to move in about a month later.My ex her dad has a talent for that, which was wonderful but he only came one day every week. He works a fiscal job so it's reasonable but we were also not allowed to do work ourselves or only work with my family I didn't want to piss off my father in law so I left it at that accepting that I would pay double rent for an extra month or so( my ex didn't chip in for the new house) my family was also not that welcome to come to help if he was working on the house, a lot of grumbling under his breath. He also didn't take my talks about wanting to move in soon, double rent, etc not seriously and just did projects that would be just fine to do later, such as doing the garden, working in the shed, working in the attic, etc. don't get me wrong I am very grateful for all his work.After two and a half months of this very infuriating process, I gave my two weeks' notice to my old landlord and told my father-in-law I would move in soon and I would move into weeks and my father, stepfather, and uncle would be into laying the laminate that week, that was not a fun talk.That weekend when my dads and uncles were working on the floor we all had lunch together. my father-in-law had his fist under his underarms so his muscles looked bigger. I have never seen anybody do this(also never him before this) and he just kept talking and talking about himself and how he just does not do things that would be embarrassed about. So I said, \"Pumping up your muscles to make them look bigger would be something to be embarrassed about\". This I an asshole thing to say and I said it out of close to three months of frustration.Now to my question. Skipping to last month, (my ex split up 5 years ago after I found out my ex was sleeping around. ) I got an email from my ex telling me I have to say sorry for making him feel less than a man. My ex-father-in-law has developed depression and my words were the biggest reason for it.People around me are split up about how big of an asshole I am so what do you think?",

	"body" : "AITA So to summarize the situation that me (S) and roommate F have been having issues with another roommate (B). Originally, there were was a fourth roommate, but she moved out over winter break but she was not factor in this situation. Since the first month of the school year B has been constantly leaving her stuff in the common areas and making a mess in the kitchen after cooking or baking sometimes at random times of the night, and will usually not clean it up for days. This has led to a bug problems that F and I have both tried to discuss with B, but she seemed to not care. This is especially frustrating to F and I as we both do not have good histories with bugs. F and I have tried several times to explain to her how the mess is affecting us mentally and physically. (Neither of us feel welcome in our own apartment because of her) Additionally she consistently has 1-2 friends over unannounced almost everyday usually until late at night, which was frustrating for me as I had early classes. It also made me and F feel like we can not use the living room and kitchen while they were in there as they never hang out in her room. For a whole semester we have tried to explain and compromise on the use of the whole kitchen and living room area, and she still has not changed. We have been reluctant to go to housing as B works for our schools housing department and we did not want to possibly affect her job, but we feel like the issues between the three of us have been dismissed because she thinks we will not take an actions against her. However after recent comments made about our “lack” of assistance cleaning the common areas (including the living room and dining table which F and I have used maybe twice since the beginning of the school year) We have decided that the best course of action is to put the situation into someone else’s hands as we feel like none of our attempts have worked. So we have reached out to housing to try and get any sort of action to be taken to improve the living situation between the three of us. To complete summarize this post the question F and I have is are we the assholes for potentially affecting B’s job and bringing this situation to housing.Edit: I’d just like to apologize in advance as this is my first time posting and I’m not familiar with it. I wanted to clarify a few questions I saw, B, F, and I live in an apartment style dorm where B is our buildings RA (hence our reluctance to go to housing as the next step up would be her boss). We each have our own bedrooms but share a common room and kitchen which is where the issues are occurring, B has completely taken over the common area with her things and occupies most of the kitchen: When she has friends over, they are in the kitchen and living room which are open to each other and act as a hallway to the bedrooms. This means when there are people in the common areas you can hear them especially movies and games which is usually what B and her friends due. I hope this clears a few things up and again I apologize if there are any mistakes.",

A few days later the group tallied all the activity options and mine and another parent, Eva’s, were the top two. I told everyone my activity was simple and did not require too much preparation. Eva agreed we would do my activity. We then split what we each would do.The first day I met anyone from the group chat was the day of the volunteer. Everyone was amazed when they learn I was Cole’s great aunt. They said they didn’t realize I was so young. Eva seemed a little displeased but I didn’t think much of it until the volunteering was over. It was a success.Eva approached me after that and said she was blindsided. The reason she agreed to my volunteer activity was because she thought I was older and not in good physical condition. As her activity was more physically demanding, she felt guilty putting an older person through it and so agreed with my activity. She said it was not cool of me to let people believe I am older than I actually am because with age comes respect and concern and I don’t deserve them as a much younger person.I didn’t think age will play such a role in the group.

I used to idolize this cousin, because she was the cool babysitter who made life interesting and made me feel cool by proxy. She even made my first prom experience an amazing one by paying for a set of nails. It all came to an abrupt halt when she started treating me differently and my immediate family after she dropped out of college and moved back home permanently after years of closeness. She stopped visiting and talking with us at family events. She even skipped birthdays and my graduation without a word unless my mother called, which made it hard for me to adjust with this sudden low contact relationship.Fast forward she now has a step-son and a bio son (2) with her husband, with the two year old being babysat while both parents work during the week (one an electrician and the other a retail store worker as well as a cheer coach for her old cheer team) by our grandmother (71F). Grandma's husband was diagnosed with cancer. It has been difficult to really face the truth but the real problem lies with the babysitting, where my cousin's son has still been going to our grandmother's home to be watched. My mother and I were unaware of this until we found out that my step-grandpa was officially put on hospice and grandma confessed that she was still watching the two year old. My mother and I had serious concerns for my grandmother not being able to spend the final moments with her husband.

	"body" : "I (15M) Live with my mother younger sister and father, I have my own room and my parents know I’m rather messy. My m often tells me to clean my room I usually end up doing it but sometimes I have better things and more important things to do. Recently I’ve discovered my mom magically knows about whether my room is clean where all my dirty clothes are and what was on my desk. This had me a bit confused at first but after around a month it realized she’s been going through my room. She does this when I go to school and on weekends. She not only goes through my room but she also takes my homework or worksheets that are in my desks and corrects them, keep in mind she is not a teacher I’ve told her multiple times I appreciate the fact she’s trying to be active in my education but she should back off a bit. I’ve also told her that she shouldn’t correct my work since the point of the homework is so my teachers can see what I understand and can improve on not what she knows. She always responds with “But you should be grateful that you know the answers now that I corrected your work”. Now this pisses me off a bit because she knows that I am a rather quiet person when it comes to academics I usually don’t talk about them and I don’t really need or ask for help it kind of makes me a bit uncomfortable. Recently I asked her for some privacy and told her “You don’t need to go through my room every day.” She replied with “but your my child and I need to check what your doing.” Now this made me a bit confused and mad so I said “How do you see what I’m doing in my room when im not even in my room?” Now she snapped she started going crazy and started shouting at me and at this point my dad came into this argument. My dad often comes into arguments where he has no context but always blindly defends my mother I tried to explain to him I want my privacy and there is no need for her to be in my room all the time. He disagreed and I respectfully asked my mother again if she could stay out of my room and she said no. So a few days ago I built I my own makeshift lock I tried it out and went to school as soon as I got back home from school the first thing my mom said was my door didn’t open and I told her that I locked it for privacy. This infuriated her and she went crazy again I once again respectfully told her I want some privacy and she doesn’t need to go through my room. My parents are pretty mad but I honestly feel like my privacy is being invaded.AITA?",

My parents have a tight budget so I wanted for them to live here rent free, have all the free food they want, and overall a stress-free lifestyle. In return, they wanted to help with the baby to alleviate some stress for us as well. They are habitual weed smokers. They smoke multiple joints a day, a piece. All I ask, is that they do not do that in my house or around my baby. They also have pets. Their dog is not potty trained. I also requested that they just monitor for accidents. They have been here for 2 weeks and have smoked INSIDE my house and their dog has left smelly surprises on a daily basis. My house currently smells like weed and dog poop. They have also eaten my whole kitchen without saving me or my husband a crumb (we have since resolved the food issue). My step dad came down with the stomach bug at the same time as me. I offered to help him while I was sick. He decided to smoke in my house while he was sick, and is upset that I still didn’t like him smoking in the house despite him not feeling well. I too was sick and my OB ended up sending me to the triage at the hospital for an IV of fluids, Zofran, and baby monitoring. I come home to my house smelling like weed and again, dog poop.

It's been mostly civil, we're still good friends and decent co-parents.When we got married, I gave him my Grandfather's ring, and he gave me his Grandmother's. When we split, I asked for the ring back right away as I adored my Pop and it has incredible sentimental value to me. I tried to return his Grandmother's ring at the time, and he refused, saying he didn't want it back in hopes we'd rekindle. I would offer it again whenever I remembered it, and R insisted he didn't want it back. Early on, I even left it on his desk, only for him to put it back on mine.Now, I have ADHD and my organization skills and memory are both not fantastic. When I first took the ring off, I kept it on my very cluttered desk, and would promptly forget it existed. When I saw it and remembered it was there, I'd offer it to R who would reject it. Just after New Year I saw it again, was turned down again, and decided I really need to put this somewhere properly before I lose it. So I put it in a little box with my engagement ring, and put it somewhere for safe keeping.I'll also note that while I've said rekindling the relationship isn't totally off the table, it's not something I'm banking on and neither should he.Yesterday, after a comment was made about me wanting to hold onto my Pop's ring even if we got back together, he got angry and demanded his Grandmother's ring back. I told him I'd put it away somewhere safe, but couldn't remember exactly where as it wasn't where I thought it was. He told me to find it immediately.I told him that isn't reasonable, as I don't have time immediately for a thorough search, and he called me TA for losing it. I told him I'd put it away so that it didn't properly go missing, and that I would find it as soon as I could but it wasn't my top priority above kids and work, and that he had plenty of chances to keep it safe and know exactly where it was every time I offered. He told me I had to return it by end of today (which I've been working for most of) and I got some nasty messages this morning. I guess he also told his father about it because I've had a bunch of messages and missed calls today that I'm not so much as looking at.AITA for not dropping everything to look for it immediately?",

Coworker B overheard that I was talking about Jamaica, and started gushing about going there over Christmas and how “immersed” in the culture she felt.I asked her where she stayed and what she did, and she said that she stayed in a Sandals resort and never really left except when she went to swim with dolphins and sail on a catamaran. I asked her whether she went to Kingston (where I was) and she said that she didn’t because it was just “too unsafe.” I then asked her if she enjoyed the food and she said that she didn’t have any of the Jamaican dishes “because she didn’t know what they were.” I didn’t say anything, and just kept a smile plastered on my face, told her that I’m “glad she enjoyed the resort”, and went back to eating my lunch and talking to Coworker A.Coworker B then questioned why I wasn’t engaging with her because “she’s been to the country” and I pointed out that she didn’t interact with locals, eat the food, or leave the Sandals except for tourist experiences so I didn’t feel like we could engage about much. She then got upset with me and accused me of “gatekeeping” my culture and ruining the memory of her vacation.

I had asked her multiple times to stop and explained it made more work for me because I have to go back around refold, rewash or whatever the case maybe because everything was done half ass. Then we got a puppy..... My MIL has literally had 1 older dog in a short amount of time so has absolutely no clue about dogs let alone the breed we have. She's been bit multiple times by him and let's him get in the trash and leaves it for me to clean up, over the summer would take him on walks when it was over 88 degrees and would leave him on our back porch in direct sun. I had gotten to the point I would put him in his kennel in the AC downstairs before I would leave and asked her to just leave him in there til I got home 2 hours later. She refused. The first time she let him out and didn't put him back in his cage. When I got home he got into 2 unopened bags of dog treats bag and all plus a bag of muffins bag and all. He was sick for 3 days after and she thought it was funny. The last round she sent me rude texts telling me she was letting him out, that she was going to do whatever she wanted, that I'm controlling and dramatic and that my dog was suffering. I missed work because I had enough and went home. I got home and the dog was on the porch again in the direct sun, mind you it was 94 out this day.

My brother and I just don't live in our home country anymore while our mom stayed there and none of us could manage travel due to work).My brother urged me to invite a couple of friends so I invited a few I consider myself close to and their long term significant others as I thought it would be awkward to not let their partners come.One of the friends I've invited (Layla) has later informed me a mutual friend of ours (Luke) was very disappointed for not receiving an invitation to the point where he gave away the gift he has intended for me to someone else.I was slightly shocked by this since Luke and I have not been talking as much or seen each other as much as I have the others in their friend group, but what affected me the most is that one of the other people I've invited (Aaron) is Lukes close friend as well as mine and I would have hoped that if something like this were to happen Aaron would at least talk to me about it, as the way Layla has said the two have already talked about it and it seemed that Aaron agreed with Luke as well as that Luke was very upset with the way it turned out.I can somewhat understand why they would rather speak between each other or omit things from me since I've only recently started talking to them, as Aaron is someone I met at university and both Layla and Luke are people I've met through Aaron.I understand we're a part of the same friend group in a way but they rarely invite me if they hang out as a group and I usually spend most of my time with Layla, while Aaron and I are flatmates at university as well as one of the first friends I've made since moving, so I don't see how it's wrong that I haven't invited Luke to something I see as only close friends and family, or why they haven't even tried asking me for a reason and I had to find all of this out through Layla.AITA?",

A week after I found out I was pregnant, I caught my now ex (24m, we'll call him Adam) cheating on me with his new girlfriend (25f, we'll call her Christine). Adam and I decided to split, but agreed that we would still co-parent.My pregnancy has been rough, since I'm still in college with a job and my parents are less than supportive, but Christine has made it so much worse.The two invite me for lunch every Wednesday to talk about the baby. Christine doesn't let me order what I want because it isn't good for the baby. So the red flags started off very slow and subtle, but they just got worse and worse.I told them what I had planned to name the baby girl. Christine told me is was one of the ugliest names she had ever heard. I explained that it was my great grandmother's name who had passed away the year prior and that she was the woman who inspired me most so I wanted to honor her. Christine keeps picking on the name and so I've thought about maybe changing it.There have been some other really strange things she has done (throwing herself a baby shower for MY baby without inviting me is also at the top), but that one probably hurt the most.Recently while at our weekly lunch, Adam and I were talking about the co-parenting deal. Christine said that she wouldn't take care of the baby since it wasn't hers. I snapped at her and asked why the hell was she constraining all the things I could and couldn't do. I probably wouldn't have been so pissed if Christine hadn't promised that she would love to watch her step-daughter, but she had.Christine and I went off on each other. During our argument, I said that it wouldn't really matter because Adam would probably cheat on her too and so she couldn't be the step-mom to our kid. Christine practically stormed off, with Adam following her. I felt pretty guilty because I find myself as a calm person and I hate getting angry at people.Now weeks later, Christine had told everyone in the town we live in. The majority of my friends have stopped talking to me and I don't really have any support. One of my good friends was Christine's younger brother and so he told all of our other friends.It's been a few weeks and I've been trying to contact both Christine and Adam, but they don't respond. I've concluded that I'm on my own now, but I keep wondering if this is all my fault. I can't help but feel horrible about what I said, the two seemed pretty happy and Christine was a lot better for Adam than I ever was. So there was no reason for me to say that about her. Can I even salvage my relationship or just cut them out of my life?The action I took was yelling at the step-mom of my child.

Doing so could bring our That to over $1000. background: I got pregnant while we were engaged but we broke up shortly before the birth. Based on the laws of our state I have full custody. We decided its best to split our time with them so we trade off weekly. We have no intertwined income and usually just pay for their needs individually. We agreed to trade off tax years but that was based on us sharing the work/cost of parenting. Thats not how its worked out. I live by myself with no real outside support. I do get help every once in a while from some family, but a good 85% is entirely just me. I pay all my bills and necessities. I rarely get babysitter. Luke does not pay child support which I have not requested.Luke lived with his family in an inherited home for the last 5+ years and has only recently decided to move out because of “boundaries”. He didnt pay rent. he paid some bills, but they were split among the other adults too. He doesnt make as much money as me but the largest reason is because he hasnt been able to keep a job.We’ve been attempting to co-parent which is not without its hardships. Luke has made it clear that hes been attempting to get out of parenting. He has repeatedly tried to excuse why he shouldnt take them including but not limited to: saying i have to keep them if they are sick with a cold my week so that it stays in 1 household only to say I should take them HIS week when someone in his house got COVID because the kid “probably didnt have it”, seeking late shifts/overnight jobs so he doesnt have to be home while they’re there, trying to find a job across the country that would keep him away 6+ months at a time because he said it was good money, and most recently saying the household is too toxic and not safe for HIM to be in. Because of the last reason, Luke has moved in with his new gf. He claims that he still sees our kid regularly, but after speaking with his family, he might get them from daycare 2-3x a week, but leaves soon after while the family takes care of the rest. There was even a few weeks after the most recent fight where he ghosted us all together. So while on paper we trade off evenly we really dont. Last year we had a big fight about this because Id claimed our kid the last 2x. This was hard for Luke because of the child tax credit and COVID benefits that he didnt get, so I can understand that. Its important to note that Luke has another child from a previous relationship and he claims them every year. Yes the family is picking up the slack for the other kid too.In order to claim our child Luke needs me to sign away my right but our mutuals have suggested NOT to let him and that he can stick with just claiming his first kid. But I want to be fair about this. I want to make the right and equitable choice. So AITAH?",

Family is important to both of us, but I also have my own to take care of at home and I work 50-60 hours a week at a physically demanding job. I take kids to and from daycare every single day. I have livestock and other animals that require quite a bit of my attention as well in the morning and evening. He works a loose schedule from 8-9am to maybe 5 or 6pm only 4 days a week and it is not a physically demanding job.Truthfully, I just don't think he understands how exhausting it is keeping up with every day life as it is and I'm trying not to hold that against him. He's never been married and has no kids of his own.We go to each other's family events together without any issues, but here lately he's been upset with me because I don't want to drag my kids and I to his nephew's games on weeknights. His sister lives 45 minutes away from us and you never know where they're gonna have the games at. I wouldn't expect his sister to drag her 2 kids to watch mine doing extra curricular activities, and I feel like she would definitely understand. But for some reason, he doesn't understand and is mad at me and pulling the rude comments out saying I've made it perfectly clear that I don't care about his family and that I refuse to go even though that's not what the issue is at all. I'm just tired and unfortunately I have more important things to take care of at home.Not to mention, my 6 year old has ADHD and by the time we get home around 5:30-6pm, his meds have worn off and he gets wild. I don't want to force him to sit in a seat and try to make him be still because it's not fair to him and it'll just be a fight that's not worth having.AITA?",

	"body" : "To preface: Me (31F) and my husband (33M) had our daughter Mary (16F) at a very young age. She was an accident and it was very hard at first, but we managed to raise a wonderful young lady.In middle school, Mary had a best friend Dan (16M). They were really close and since we’re neighbors, we encouraged them to hang out together.However as they started high school, Dan started running with the wrong crowd. He befriended a kid who would sneak out, drink, engage in destructive activities. Together they started bullying Mary. Since then I have some sort of a slow beef with Dan’s mom (44F). We are on speaking terms, but things are somewhat rough between us. I personally consider her parenting style a little too lax, she thinks I'm being too strict.It escalated when this kid pissed in Mary’s car’s gas tank. To say I was fuming was an understatement. I turned into a full-blown momzilla. I was ready to sue his whole family, luckily it didn’t happen since his mom was cooperative and compensated for the damage. I also told Dan’s mom that her kid’s friend destroyed my daughter’s property. No reaction.Obviously, things escalated further. Dan and his friend committed a felony. To be honest, it was expected of his friend, but the fact that Dan was an accomplice shocked me deeply. He’s a gentle and kind guy and it was horrible that he fell under bad influence. Dan’s mom was shocked as well, but to be honest it was something that she could expect after finding out that her kid got under bad influence, doing nothing about it, buying him substances so he could share with his friends. We live in CO btw, but still weed isn't something I'd introduce my child to.That was what I openly told her after she complained about “how come my precious baby commit a felony” and “how did you manage to make Mary avoid the sketchy stuff”. I told her that if she was slightly stricter with her parenting, she’d avoid Dan having legal troubles now. She told me that I’m being hypocritical since I did quite an amount of stupid stuff in my youth too. I did, and I’m not proud of it. But I’ve never touched substances and I’ve never committed a felony. I took the responsibility and accepted the consequences and managed to raise a decent human being who won’t repeat my mistakes.I’m an insightful person and I’ve been thinking now whether it was worth it to drag the conflict for all this time and escalating it into an open confrontation.",

I wont bore you with details but just know she's the nicest and prettiest girl I know, im so lucky to have her.A couple months into the relationship I told her that I was going to take a trip to Spain with my family. It was pretty close to her birthday so she got a little sad, but I told her I'd be back a day or so before.When I was in Barcelona I realized there was a Harry Styles concert going on, which is her favorite artist BY FAR. I thought it'd be nice if I got her a Tour Shirt for her birthday since she likes so much but since I didn't have a ticket I had to bribe the security guard to let me in to where the store was, fortunately it worked and bought her the shirt and a Special Edition Vinyl.When I came back home I gave her the present for her birthday and she seemed to love it. Nothing came from that as it was a couples months back. The problem comes when today that one mutual friend called me and said he wanted to talk.He told me she came by his house today for a get together their friend group had. Someone brought up the topic of \"Gifts\" to which my girlfriend told everyone that she hated the gift I gave her fir her birthday. She stated that she thought that since it was her birthday I'd get her a much more nicer and expensive gift. She cares a lot about her birthday and she thought that a shirt and a Vinyl was really lame.So im here wondering, what the hell? I was really hurt by this because I thought it was a nice and caring gift, if you wanna talk money the shirt was 150 EUROS and the vinyl was 40 ( about $230 USD). We live in a Third World Country so that money is some people's monthly salary...Did I mess up by not getting her a more expensive gift? Should I tell her how I feel?",

I’m not even invited to the ceremony - just the reception and I have to pay to fly there. Am I the asshole?EDIT: I’m not flying for the engagement shoot but I wasn’t invited to the ceremony and will have to pay my own flight ticket to attend the reception.

I grew up in a household where it didn’t matter if you were a man or woman, cooking and cleaning were basic life skills and you had to learn them. To add onto this, I’m not particularly close with her brother either.The last time I tried to cook for my friend (and my friend only) he kept hovering around the kitchen, opening and closing cupboards absentmindedly, trying to bring quiet attention to himself, and I started to feel a little guilty for not cooking any for him.I told my friend (privately) that I don’t want to cook for him because he never helps out with household chores, and she said: “that doesn’t mean he doesn’t deserve to eat!” as if someone cooking for him is his only lifeline and only way of getting food…She also made the excuse that he financially contributes to the home, but so do I. I pay rent to their mother every month, so I don’t see how he can’t cook/clean too.I get the feeling that he doesn’t appreciate that I don’t cook for him, but if I’m financially contributing to the home, cooking AND cleaning while he plays video games all day, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth I guess.Edit: Since people were getting confused, there’s only 4 people in the household. My friend, her brother, their mother and myself. My friend and her mother both cook and clean and my friends brother doesn’t help with any household chores.My friend and her mother cook, but they’re both so busy with work that sometimes my friends brother won’t get anything to eat until their mother comes home to cook for him. Their mother doesn’t get back until late at night, meaning I don’t really get the chance to cook for her (b/c I sleep early).

They take up quite a bit of space so I like to gift them to my friends and before starting a project I will show them some patterns and ask them to choose which one they'd like.Two months ago I sent several patterns to a friend. He chose two and told me he'd be pleased with either one and the choice was mine to make. And I made a choice. It took me about three weeks to make and I giddily presented it to him. He took one glance at it and said he liked the other pattern best. That's it. I was quite hurt because he could've told me that ahead of time, but I didn't make a fuss because I can't force someone to enjoy something. However, I did make a mental note to never cross stitch anything for him again.On with the issue. Last week I finished the pattern he liked most because my other friend had chosen it. I uploaded the picture on social media for bragging rights and immediately got a message from him asking if I made it for him. I replied with a snarky, \"of course not\". He tried to change my mind and eventually the silly argument escalated to him calling me \"a bad friend\" and few other colorful words for choosing a person I know for only a couple of years over him (I know him for 12). I still refused and honestly am pretty upset over the whole issue, regardless of silly how it is. Should I just give him the pattern and call it a day?

But she said wow, so your grades are more important than me and my health? I said it's not more important, but it is important. I said she could go to the bookie at our school and buy Advil. She was close by because I parked my car in the garage of that building, but she said she's in way too much pain to go.Plus, she said she's literally bleeding through her clothes and has no tampons.

Which resulted in her getting upset I was making it her fault and she called me sexist and said I have no idea what it's like for her. I agreed I didn't, but said I'd be there in 20 minutes.I took the quiz and ended up meeting her at my car 20 minutes later with Advil, tampons, and water. But she is not happy.

Long story short we adopted her and raised her as her mother and father.Husband and I procrastinated on this but we never gave her the talk. So we decided to just rip the band aid off. She was asking about why people get amicably divorced (not in those words) and I just said “well to be honest with you, I don’t know. I’ve only ever been with your dad, and obviously we never broke up.”And then kids got in the conversation and she asked the “why are you guys so much younger than all the other moms and dads?”And I just said “we’ll talk about that later” and we did. Husband and I talked to her in her room and just explained to her why the other parents are older and where she came from. She had an idea, but never got the full story. She didn’t cry at first. She just had questions, and then said “wait, Mommy, so that means we aren’t related at all?” And I didn’t know what to say and she broke down.Hardest moment of my life.And I just told her the truth. I said just because she came from somewhere different it doesn’t mean we love her any less than her siblings, and she’ll always be my first born.She was still very upset to find we aren’t related by blood.

I ignored some pretty serious red flags; she had just lost her job right after we met, and her ex had stopped paying half the lease on her house. She was obviously stressed about all that, so when she was especially sensitive to any perceived criticism, and would react with remarkable anger, and would be a long time cooling off, I figured it was a product of al that stress, and went out of my way to smooth things over.We had many arguments, during which she'd take any cheap shot she could think of to hurt my feelings.It all came to a head when I went on vacation. I'd helped her out with her lease, but despite giving her more and more money she had to move out. She house-sat for me while I was away, and put her stuff in storage, which I paid for. She took her essentials to my place while I was away.She picked fights over imaginary stuff almost every day I was away and did a terrible job looking after my place. When I got home, after a couple of days having anxiety attacks whenever I walked in the house, I told her she needed to move out and find her own place. She'd already registered herself to vote at my address, and registered her daughter for school in my neighborhood, and I felt really guilty because she still wasn't working. I offered to help her find a decent but affordable apartment in the school district, which she refused. I told her I'd pay her storage through the end of the year, but not after that.What followed was a nightmare where she maligned me to anyone she had contact info for, threatened to sue and had a lawyer send an \"illegal eviction\" notice. She went to the police to get a TRO when she came to pick up some of her stuff, and I was there, working from home. She claimed I was \"trying to coerce her into the house against her will\" and in her mind, that was DV. Anyone who knows me knows what a ridiculous claim that is, and I've never had a physical altercation with an SO in my life, certainly not with her. She was angling to get a legal order to let her back in the house, with a restraining order so that I couldn't be there at the same time, effectively stealing my home from me. It didn't work, because none of these claims were remotely true, and as far as I know, she never even got as far as officially filing anything.This was all late last summer. It is now 4 months later. I've paid for her storage since then, but when I got the bill for January's storage fees, I removed my credit card from the account, and told her the same day that she'd need to arrange to pay it herself. Today she insists that I owe her still, and should continue to pay for her storage …by sending her cash via Venmo, no less, not directly to the storage company.  AITA for not continuing to pay?

I texted him that  I would pay 150 if he wanted, and he responded with things like \"Don't speak to me till you send my money,\" \"Pay me my money to don't fucking talk to me,\" and \"That 150 can count towards the 275 you owed me.\" I told him to sleep it over and think about me offering $150 and he told me that he decided to unadd him on everything and not to contact him till I \"paid him his money.\"(For added context, although this might not be fair to him, he dropped me off at my place yesterday and I mentioned that I saw someone getting towed here and made a joke to which he responded.)I understand that I might be partly liable and should have checked again when he showed up, but if he's going to keep being an asshole about it am I in my right to refuse to pay him anything?

About a year or so into their marriage, our mom started to hint at a new sibling.So you could imagine our surprise when our 40 year old mother who never wanted to marry or have a third child,tells us she’s indeed pregnant.My first thought was “isn’t this a bit soon?”We were happy for her but we didn’t want a new Sibling. Fast forward to when the baby was born, there were getting divorced.he had took the money they both saved for my mom’s maternity leave.So my mother couldn’t even enjoy her pregnancy & had to go back to work earlier than planned. This is where the problem comes in. David is basically nonexistent now. My mother is a nurse, working 8-12 hour night shifts,picking up whenever she can. While I’m a full time student & PT Operations Specialist.I started to work less hours to help her out with the baby. Since my brother had little experience w/ newborns.Left me to care for him when she wasn’t home with him.This continued for a year BUT now I feel guilty & have this growing resentment toward my mom for it.She depends on me to help her with everything.It got to a point where she would tell me not to pick up shifts so I could watch the baby more while she worked or if she wanted to go to work early for extra money. Mind you, my brother is capable to help at this point but doesn’t unless I’m not available. I never minded helping her & I’m the only person she can rely on for help.she praises me for being so helpful,but as soon as I complain about how I think it’s unfair that my life had to completely change & revolve around a baby that’s not mine.while my brother got to just lock his door ,make messes,video games all night and sleep in til 5pm, suddenly it’s “why is everything an argument with you, Why can’t you just say okay mom”.It’s like a slap in the face & makes me not want to help her.when it’s kept me from working,no sleep ,less studying, or things that make me happy.I have also  been diagnosed with Severe General Anxiety&MDD,so taking care of the baby is very difficult of me, paired with the stress of trying to get a masters in psychology&pressure to move out. My boyfriend has been more involved after noticing increased my stress level.Recently She started  talking badly about him saying“he’s a guy with nothing going for himself,I don’t know why you waste your time”.Yet He goes out of his way doing things like buying food for the house,gas in my moms car for her,groceries,Fixing things around the house ,fixing her car.All without being asked or paid for his services. So her saying that about him INFURIATED ME.Now I have been purposely pointing out her hypocrisy, putting my needs first & refusing to do anything that will not benefit me. This whole situation has made me NOT want kids in the future.",

	"body" : "I know the title sounds goofy, and you may think I am the bad guy here. But I (24F) had a 6 month old male Greyhound pup that I named Goose. I had always wanted a greyhound and was excited. I was planning on visiting another state with a few girlfriends of mine, for only a week. I needed someone to watch Goose.My sister May (32F) offered to watch him and I told her I would send her emergency money for Goose. For food, toys and whatever needs he need. She agreed and my niece (7F) loves Goose. So I though everything was great. I went on my travel with my girlfriends and it was lovely and great but on the last day May called to say that Goose ran off and she can’t find him. I was very devastated when I heard that. So I came home from my travel a bit more early to see if I can find Goose. But I couldn’t, I asked May how he got out.She told me she just let him out, so he can stretch his legs. After 20 minutes she went to go get him. To see he wasn’t in her backyard. She panicked and that’s when she called me. For a while I was just depressed. All my friends try to cheer me up. It helped a little while but my best friend Cora found on Facebook, a picture of a small family with my dog Goose. It was one of my nieces friends. So I hurried on and contacted them, to tell them that was my missing dog Goose. If I can have him back.They said no and that May said I didn’t want him. I begged and said he is under my name and chipped and I never said I didn’t want him. It was all false, I was at another state for vacation. May was suppose to watch him. Not give him away. I told them I would pay them however much just so I can have him back.They just blocked me. I went over to May and when she opened the door. I freaked out at her demanding her to tell me why she gave away Goose. She said that wasn’t true, that he ran off. I told her to cut the crap and tell me truth after I showed her the pictures and messages. She told me she needed the money for my niece. That the money they needed was more important than a dumb dog. So I barged into her house and took her dog Dazey.She yelled at me that I can’t take Dazey. I told her that since she gave my pup away, I can take hers. Since my mental health is more important than a dumb dog. I said she better get Goose back or I will take legal actions. I left with Dazey and now sitting at home wondering if AITA?",

Now it is rare magic the gathering cards, before that it was Star Wars everything collectors item…I’m all for him enjoying his collectors items, but he’s got a habit of bouncing around, and as a result we have storage space in our house filled with boxed action figures, and Star Wars stuff. Now that he’s collecting magick cards there’s decks all over the counters/table…I’m not only frustrated with the constant spending, but I’m frustrated that we have nowhere to put this stuff and he keeps getting into something new…I (31 female) just got really upset with him showing me another box of cards he just bought, and this is my primary reason…I AM 7 months pregnant…we already have two kids, in 3 months time I will be taking time off of work and I am self employed so every cent I’m making right now I’m saving. My shopping carts are full of things we need for a newborn, his is toys for himself/our son we have zero room for.I’m nesting, and hormonal, and incredibly overwhelmed with the cluttered space, as well as his spending. He always buys these things and tells me once it’s too late to rationalize with him, the money is already spent.I managed to get him to stop buying the action figures early in my pregnancy on this argument alone: we Don’t haven’t the space and right now we need to save not spend frivolously…that kept him at bay for the last 5 months, until this new passion arose. I’m just really frustrated and when he pulled out the box to show me what he bought I told him I didn’t even want to look at it, and that I was pissed…he tried to justify it saying it wasn’t that expensive, but neither are the things we actually need right now that I’m buying for the baby that’s coming…He ran off to the kitchen and started silently doing dishes, I’m sitting here having an internal quiet panic attack because he knows exactly how I feel about this right now and I honestly want to cry in frustration. I’m not sure if I overreacted or not, but we’ve literally had this conversation….he’s promised not to do it again without talking to me first already…so him promising that again is so empty to me.I’m so overwhelmed.",

	"title" : "WIBTA if I refused to give my fiancé money ever again?",
	"body" : "My fiancé and I have 2 kids. We agreed that I'd stay home and care for them until they both go off to school. He'd pay all the bills and such since it'd be a lot cheaper for me to stay home versus sending our disabled child to daycare.I received some money for Xmas from my dad that he told me to spend on myself and the kids. Fiancé found out about this money and asked to borrow it. I told him i didn't really want to since we needed diapers and wipes and other stuff for our kids and I planned on buying those with the money my dad gave me. (My mom ended up buying them as a late gift)Fiancé decided to write out a 'contract' that stated he legally had to pay me back in 2 weeks. I added in that if he couldn't pay it by his own deadline that he'd owe an additional $100 and he agreed to that. He signed the contract and marked it with a thumb print and everything.The first deadline was on the 13th this month. He paid me $5 back of the $125 he owed me by then. The second deadline is the 31st. He's now telling me he just can't pay it back and is saying that partners don't do this. That they're supposed to help each other out etc. I told him it was his idea for the contract and that he agreed to both terms (its even on video of him signing it btw)My thing is, I wouldn't be so pressed about being paid back if the day I lent him the money he didn't decide to buy $60 worth of weed instead of paying his car note like he said he would.He's saying I should be more than glad to help my partner who's struggling. Which I would be. If he wouldn't spend his bill money on weed and the lottery.So I told him either he can pay back the full amount of $225 that he AGREED to paying me or he will get absolutely nothing from me anymore. I have zero income. The money I get is gifted to me by family or on the rare occasion from him. I've been trying to find a work from home job but haven't found one I qualify for yet. And since he doesn't work a regular job I can't just work on his off hours since he doesn't have a set schedule. Some days he works mornings some days he works nights and he doesn't know until the day of or the day before.AITA here?Edit: this got a lot more comments than I anticipated and I'm still trying to read through them all. I saw a lot of questions so I wanted to make an edit to answer as many as I can instead of repeating myself a million times in replies.When he and I had first gotten together he was doing a lot better financially. He wasn't spending his money on weed nearly as much as he is now. He was actually providing at first. Even when we had our first kid 4 years ago he was still pretty good. We planned on stopping at one kid until our oldest was much older so I'd gotten on birth control not long after having our oldest. My birth control ended up failing and I found out I was pregnant too late to do anything about it. At that time things were still doing a lot better than they are now so I figured things would stay good after having our second.When I was still pregnant with my youngest our oldest became disabled. She suffered a terrible fall that drastically changed everything for us. She's been in and out of the hospital more times than I can even count. It was sudden and unexpected. She was already receiving Medicaid so medical bills weren't and aren't an issue thankfully but her disability has still taken its toll on everyone.When he asked to borrow the $125 I told him no at first but he kept insisting that he'd lose his car if he didn't make the car payment. It wasn't until he answered a FaceTime call from his dealer with me sitting next to him that I found out that he had used $60 of the $125 to buy weed. I saw someone say I smoke too in the comments, I don't. I tried weed once when I was like 20 and hated it. I've told my fiancé that I was okay with him smoking as long as it didn't interfere with necessities even before having kids with him. He seemed to be on board with that for years and years then it's like a flip switched. I still don't mind him smoking, just as long as our families needs are met first.I also saw some people suggesting to do Uber eats and stuff like that, I definitely would but we are a one car family and he always has the car when he works otherwise I'd be out there doing deliveries. I have applied for disability for my oldest but the process is still on going so we haven't received payment yet. I do try to do surveys to make a little extra money every chance I get but I'm going to look into the work from home suggestions some of y'all had and try to get one asap.I do receive wic and Ebt so I buy most of the food. He buys anything extra and pays the rest of the bills- or rather he's supposed to. He doesn't tell me much about his finances so I don't know exactly how much money he has coming in and how much the bills are. When I ask him he gets pretty angry so I just drop the subject.A lot of people also suggested I should leave him. I know that's probably for the better but it's hard when you still love someone. He was a great partner for years before we had our first and he was a great father for awhile after having our first. I don't want to just throw that all away.I hope I explained things a lot better.",

Instead of going out.Tomorrow, I will help him working on his interviews.I was very frustrated, I really wanted to go out and enjoy 1hour of sun outside. In the end it was almost sunset when we got out of the apartment.And I said to him that it is quite annoying when he gives me tasks like this.

I apologized profusely for how I made him feel and all. I do feel bad.BUT. SOMEWHERE. IN MY MIND. I replay the story and I can't stop thinking that I was in the right.

My ex-spouse took care of him for a while, then my ex-SIL and her wife - who I was on good terms with - took him in. I still couldn't take him because the place I live didn't allow pets. Ex-SIL and wife adore cats and I knew that Dash would be taken care of.I am grateful that ex-SIL and wife made Dash's final years comfortable. I would be sent photos and general updates about how he was going. I visited when I could, which wasn't as often as I liked because they live very far away. Dash was deeply loved and cared for. He brought joy to all of our lives.I had been hosting D&D games for years, before and after I left my ex. Our last session was this past November. By the end, it was clear that wife was upset. I thought it had been something I had done that upset her. The game ended early and we took a break for the rest of the year. I gave them space I thought they needed.In the new year, ex-SIL and wife contact me again to schedule our next session for tonight. I was worried, but I agreed. I saw wanted to make up for last time.I was talking to my kids (7m and 9m) earlier this week. Out of nowhere, they tell me that Dash is dead. I kept a straight face for their sake and tried to move on. When I asked my ex how the kids were handling it, I got more information than expected. They had seen Dash over Christmas. His kidneys were failing. Dash passed away two weeks ago.Dash was old, and the fact he has passed and how isn't what upsets me. I had no idea how sick he had been recently. Ex-SIL and wife didn't tell me anything. Dash's passing isn't their fault and this is probably a very difficult time for them. It's that I didn't get to say goodbye to Dash, and the news had to come from my kids.I was devastated and furious. They had so much time to tell me what was happening. I still don't understand why they couldn't just say that he didn't have much time left and that I should come to see him. Now Dash is dead and will never get the chance to thank him for being there all those years.I decided that if they were going to deny me the courtesy of telling me and being there in his final moments, I had no reason to DM for them. I deleted our discord server and my notes, and went silent.Tonight, I get a message from ex-SIL asking about the session. I briefly respond, explaining that I know about Dash, that I am having a lot of mixed feelings, and that I'm not ready now. This is followed by a message from wife. Apparently, she was planning on telling me tonight. I can't help but wonder if she was going to tell me before or after the session.Ex-SIL and wife are understandably upset. They cared very deeply for Dash. Still, I'm very hurt. If they had only told me sooner, I could have had one more chance to see him again. I cannot talk to them right now, and that means not DMing for them for a long time.",

To provide some backstory I, 19, female and my friend Sara, 18, female met over the summer of 2023 we grew extremely close and hung out almost everyday. In mid July I met my then boyfriend Tommy, 19, male we dated on and off until the end of august and called it quits as the relationship was extremely toxic. I would tell Sara all of the problems Tommy and I were having in our relationship and she would support me saying i should leave him and he didn’t deserve me. After leaving the relationship Tommy and I stayed friends and in the middle of october we ended up meeting up with a group of friends including Sara and reconsidering the end of our relationship. At the beginning of the relationship everything was going smoothly Sara was with her new Boyfriend, a good friend of the group, named Ryan, 19, male and Tommy and my relationship seemed to move in a positive direction after getting back together. In mid November Sara and Ryan broke up and this is when Tommy and I started to get distant. I noticed that after Sara and Ryan’s relationship ended Tommy spent more time talking to her and grew more distant from me, i just figured he was being a good friend as they insisted they had no physical attraction to each other and their friendship was completely platonic. So, one night Tommy was with his friends and I called to see what time he was gonna get home. I was shocked when his friends asked if I knew about the texts Sara had been sending Tommy. I was shocked and confronted Tommy immediately and asked if he had been cheating on me with Sara. He denied this several times saying that the messages were only one sided. I texted Sara and she told me a completely different story. At this point I didn’t know who to believe and so i chose to trust Tommy. Later that week I went on vacation with my family and while I was on my trip I got a message sent to me of a screen shot texts to Sara from my boyfriend about the cheating and him trying to disguise it. I was disgusted and broke up with Tommy immediately and told Sara that I shouldn’t have assumed it was one sided. This is where I maybe the assh*le. My friends are saying i should forgive her as it was entirely her fault and my boyfriend should’ve stayed loyal in the first place. But Sara and Tommy are now dating and I don’t know if I can find it within me to forgive them let alone stay friends with them. My friends are saying I am the asshole as it was a mistake and I shouldn’t be that upset and if I don’t forgive her and make up I am going to destroy the friend group.

This girl lives with her boyfriend in a different city, around 3.5 hour drive from my city. She used to travel to my city on Mon, stayed in a bunk bed at a hostel for 2-3 nights, and went back to her city.During the exam period one year ago, she was assigned to a bunk bed in a mixed dorm. She called me around 10pm asking if she could stay at my place. I said fine. She kept on saying how nice my room is, asking if she could stay for the exam period. As it would be only 3-nights stay, I didn't really mind.Fast forward to this October, she asked if she could stay 2 nights every week. I felt sorry for her when she has to spend a lot of money on traveling and hostel, so I said yes. I realized this is a wrong decision.I thought that she is 31, so she should know basic etiquettes like sharing the housework. But no, she never cleans the kitchen. When we run out of daily things like tissue paper, she just told me: Hey, we run out of it. She doesn't even take the trash out, even though the main trash bins are right downstairs. She just said, hey, the trash stinks. She does pay me some money, but it is not even a quarter of my rent. Mind you, dorm price is so cheap, may be even half the normal price. So a quarter of my rent is just 4 nights in a bunk bed at a hostel.The breaking point for me is one time, she arrived late. She forgot her toothbrush, and stores were all closed. I used an electric toothbrush, so I lend her a replacement head. I thought that she just used it that night and would buy a new one. But no, she continued to use it. I was so annoyed when I realized and I threw the head away. When she came back, she angrily asked my where is her toothbrush, I just said I threw it away. She complained she still used it, and I just said I didn't know, and I also did not have any extra heads. She complained she had to buy a new one tomorrow.We are going to be in exam period again. This time, she has stayed for almost 2 weeks. She said she would go to library to focus on studying, so she would not bother me too much. Again, I didn't know how to say no. I am going to have a very important exam in 3 weeks, and super stressed right now. I have a part-time job WFH, so now I stay home almost the whole day. She went to library maybe for 2 days every week, and stay inside my room all the other days. And she decides now is the time to lose some weights, so she does high impact cardio every day. I told her to go to the minigym in basement, but she complained it's cold and dirty. Maybe somebody will tell me go to library, but I keeps thinking this is my room, why do I even have to  give it up to somebody else???So all things combined, I want to kick her out of my room. I get to the point when I never actively start a conversation with her, so that I don't snap and say something bad.So, AITA?",

He has made me feel unlovable and characterless for literally being with just 2 guys before him (last was over 3 yrs back). THERE IS A LOT MORE.

Yes! right when I was telling me I’m upset that I’m unsure what he wants from me, he sent me one. I got super angry and we decided to never talk. I was visiting his city to meet a cousin. He asked me to meet him but I didn’t. He had already given me a hundred reasons why I am not good enough for him. He later got angry that I did wrong to not meet him. He also told me that he wants to meet me in his apartment before he said if I’m uncomfortable we could go to a restaurant. I just thought I would be losing my self respect if I meet him.

Stopped talking. Last week he sent me the pic of his tongue again. I kept asking him to go see a doctor. He just doesn’t. I made him get a dental insurance. But that night he said more hurtful things like how I am a mess because I had dated two guys before. PS - I have a very normal past. Nothing wild. 2 relationships- for 3 months and 1 yr each, 7 and 3 yrs back, no contact with any of the exes right after the breakup. He never dated anyone.

I’m a fresh graduate, I can’t treat complications like those and we are also in different states.Everytime I talk to him I feel more worthless, it’s like I’m explaining things to a wall, he keeps asking for explanations and when I do he would just doesn’t care to even listen and rather abuse me. Explanations for literally anything. Like this one time I got upset over a lost package and he judged me there too for being a neurotic?? He even went on Reddit and posted my insecurities, about my family trauma and called me low iq. I’m tired of him but it just feels wrong to leave him atm.AITAH for leaving my toxic (almost/never bf) alone during his cancer scare times?",

	"body" : "My girlfriend (32F) and I (41M) have an online relationship and have done so for about 6 months.We meet up when we can but most of our communication is via FaceTime, phone and text.She lives in a rural area and due to a complete lack of rental accommodation she still lives in the same house as her ex finance (38m) with their two kids. They separated 2 years ago after he cheated on and had a 12 months relationship with another woman in secret. They have separate bedrooms and live separate lives but work together on raising the kids.Recently she mentioned she was taking the kids away on a vacation. It had been planned for months but she hadn’t mentioned it to me.  It wasn’t until after the trip started that I found out she had taken the ex with her. That detail had not been mentioned once in any discussion around the vacation. I’m told this was a last minute change due to him being able to get time off work.When I came to the realisation that he was there with her I voiced my concern at not having been informed that she was taking her ex on a trip with her. I expected some acknowledgment that this was, at the very least, a pretty significant oversight on her part and some sign that she understood going on vacation with her ex was absolutely something I would expect to be told and that I was justified in feeling upset by the omission.The reaction was very different.

	"body" : "For the past 4ish years, I've been trying to get myself a puppy of a specific breed. However due to the pandemic, economy, etc, I had trouble launching my career. Now I am well on my way and financially capable of taking on a new friend. Over these years I've done a lot of research, I have specific breeders in mind (and I'm on some wait lists), and overall I have been prepping myself.A couple days ago, one of my sisters spilled the beans about a big surprise for me because she couldn't hold it in any longer. Everyone in my family is chipping in to get me a dog for my birthday. Wonderful, and they are thoughtful enough to get the specific dog breed I've been in love with for years! Originally I thought she brought me in to give some help and guidance but that was not the case. She brought me in because she wants me to \"pick the puppy I want\", and led me to a breeder's website. Suddenly I started seeing red flags and when I started looking the specific breeder up, even more red flags.I started telling her I wasn't sure about this breeder. I brought up my concerns, as well as things I've found online about this breeder, and what I personally was looking for in a breeder. Not to get into too much detail for a bit of privacy, but for instance, the breeder she has chosen seems to almost always have puppies and litters available most of the year. I also cannot find any public health records, which I've been able to with every other breeder I've been in contact with.After starting to push back on this, my sister in turn started pushing back on me with this. She had been doing a few months of research, sent messages and \"essays\" to over 50 breeders, and had really \"connected\" with this person after talking on the phone with them. Since then every time I've brought something up, she immediately says she understands but this breeder is fine.Eventually I flat out asked if she wanted me to send her anything like the bad reviews and comments I found on places like reddit and she said fine. I sent them to her. After reading them, I get a response back about 10 minutes later that just says \"I think they're talking about a different [insert breeder's name here]\". On top of that, she sent all the negative reviews and comments directly to the breeder in a show of \"full transparency\", which the breeder immediately got back with a bunch of comments explaining away the issues such as \"these are people that don't really know us or have never worked with us\" and \"people with this dog breed are incredibility cliquish\"I'm worried that she might just go ahead and get a dog from this breeder for me, she's much more concerned with \"giving me a dog rather than a check for a dog in the future\".This comes to my final question: WIBTA after all this that, if it comes to this, I refuse to take the dog. I get the idea of gift giving and I don't want to be ungrateful. However, this is a 10-15 year commitment and really should be my dog.",

	"body" : "I am a 30yo f, youngest of 5 siblings. I am the primary caregiver for my elderly parents and i live with them. I dont have a significant other or family of my own(i.e. kids etc). All of my siblings do and are living separately but still within 40 mins drive of each other. Over a year ago my mom was diagnosed with cancer. The family knows this. A couple months ago it was discovered that her treatment isn't working that well anymore and she would have to transition to traditional chemo.the treatment still semi works but not as well as it did for the past year. After weeks of deliberations and discussions (mom, dad, and i along with her doctors), my mom has decided to not do chemo but rather continue the current treatment until the end. The oncologist cannot really estimate how fast the cancer will grow but estimates my mom to have 3 to 6 months.  Physically looking at her no one would know she has cancer, she just looks like a normal old lady. Since the beginning all my siblings were pretty hands off with her treatment, past the first couple months no one really brought up the subject. It was me shouldering everything alone. Taking mom to appts etc. Which i dont mind because shes my mom, but it bothered me that everyone swept it under the rug. They would do the normal greetings and visits and they continued to live and not ask about the cancer as if it doesn't exist. I am hesitant on telling my siblings because I honestly don't want to deal with them pestering me with questions about this that and the other when for the past over a year none of them asked how mom was doing related to the cancer treatment. It emotionally upsets me and my mom when we talk about it so I also don't want to upset her. We only recently officially told the oncologist that she does not want to do chemo and it was a very difficult appt. My mom and I are pretty similar, she would rather not be sickly/hospital bound only to potentially live another year or 2, because to her its not really living at that point, it's not comfortable. She also does not want people to fuss over her. I am conflicted on what to do and I keep pushing back when I should tell my siblings if at all.

I switched into software this year and have little experience but am working really hard to keep up with others since they are all more experienced than me.I am home for the weekend. my uncle is over for dinner at our house. He's is asking me about my school. I tell him about how I switched into software and how I am currently looking for an internship this summer but it has been hard since I'm new to programming and don't have that much experience.He has the audacity to go on and say stuff like \"Why would you choose software engineering? most people in there have been coding since they were 10 and are way more experienced than you... there NO WAY you'll be successful even trying your best. I mean... only like 5% truly make it. Its basically impossible for you. Why didnt you choose something easier that you actually have a chance at succeeding in. I dont mean to discourage, Im just being realistic. You know me.. i dont like to sugarcoat and im telling you now you cant do it\" After have a brief conversation with him about this where he just goes ON and ON about how I cant do well. I get frustrated and without saying anything else i leave the room and go to my room upstairs.At this point I was FUMING, i could feel my blood boiling but they only thing I could really do was sit there and cry. So there I am in my room bawling my eyes out because I didnt know what else to do.Then, I heard the conversation he is having with my parents downstairs and he said verbatim \"shes an entitled whiny b*tch\" ... \"her brother is better than her\" ... \" she wont be successful like her brother\" ... etc etc. literally AWFUL things. Now, if you know anything about me, you know that my academics/career means EVERYTHING to me. Ive worked incredibly hard to get to where I am and have the grades that I do. Also, the topic of comparing success between my brother and I is a touchy subject for me.So at this point I was so angry in my room listening to him say this. Worst of all my parents were listening and didnt defend me at all. I got so angry listening to this, I opened my door and yelled \"STFU\", then my uncle comes upstairs and starts yelling at me saying \"you are entitled and spoiled and act like the world revolves around you. you will never amount to anything and i'm saying this because its what you need to hear\" me and him are in a screaming match for a bit. in front of his wife and kids I say \"GTFO, I dont wanna hear whatever it is you have to say. Youre a c*nt. Who are you to tell me what I am capable of\" and instead of defending me, my parents go \"you cant to talk him like that. that is your uncle, that is incredibly disrespectful \". I was so angry I packed my stuff up and I got in an uber and went back to my university town that night. Ive been crying the entire night. What do you guys think?",

	"body" : "I (25F) am currently planning a wedding with my longtime boyfriend of approx. 4 years. With that, I am currently picking out bridesmaids and my maid of honor. I asked one of my friends (24F) I have known since high school to be a bridesmaid. We have had an on/off friendship since we became adults. Albeit, I may have fallen short as a friend from time to time, but we learn, we grow, and we change. However, as I have been going through this process and planning out how I picture the big day, I don't see her standing up there with me anymore.Here's some history, between the ages of 18-20 I was in an abusive relationship. A lot of times when things were going wrong, I would reach out to my friend to vent and talk to her just for support. While in the midst of that, she took me off of all social media and stopped returning my texts. When we finally did reconnect, my older brother, who is friends with her as well, told me she said she stopped talking to me because \"she always had problems whenever we spoke\". We talked it out, I apologized, but it stuck with me that I can't talk to her about everything.A few years later I was 22 and had already been with my boyfriend for quite some time and I was having a really hard time with life. My boyfriend's friend (24F currently) was there for me and always gave me a listening ear and would even invite me out the house to hang out together or with her friends. I would invite my friend out to go out, party, the normal things 21 and 22 year old women do, but she would always say no. I would later see her on social media with other people doing what I invited her out to do. This made it easier for me and my boyfriend's friend closer and I spent a lot more time with her, she is always there. I wasn't aware, but my friend was seeing this and starting to feel left out. Again, she took me off of all socials and stopped returning my calls and texts again. This time I wasn't sure what I did wrong, but I figured, she had been separating herself for a while and she no longer wanted to be friends.Last year (approx 2 years since the fall out), again, my older brother was the bridge of communication and she said, \"she ditched me to hang out with her new friends so I left.\" Me and my friend talked it out and again I found myself apologizing and letting her explain her side, but never telling her how much it hurt me. At this point I felt like I just had to be there for her all the time, but not expect for her to be there for me.Once we got back to being friends, again, she found herself in a bad relationship and I supported her through it all and just stopped taking it personal when she went out with her friends instead of me. She got out of that relationship, but now she has a new person in her life which I am happy for her, but I have been pushed to the wayside again and my boyfriend's friend is there to pick up the pieces again. I am not sure what to do anymore. Please help!",

Which also means we would just pay for each other randomly and then at the end of the day just give the money back.But after few months I began to see small changes. She started to say things like, \"I'll pay you later... I don't have money rn I'll pay once I have money... Etc etc...\". I am a very shy person so I get embarrassed to ask for my money back and with her if i never asked my money back she wouldn't pay me.So this one time we 4 friends decided to order food online. I payed for everyone and then after calculating each person needed to pay me 90Rs. But Sam asked me for 50 more Rs as she wanted to order something else.So she owed me 140Rs which she didn't pay me back at that time. Everyone was okay with it but I was not, I knew if I didn't asked her now she would never pay me back. So after asking her 3 times she sent me 90 Rs and told everyone about it.I then reminded her about the 50Rs and she got really angry about it. She was like, \" I already payed 90 Rs why are you asking me for 50 extra...\" I told her about her side dish and even showed her the bill. The cherry on top moment started here. She started to cry in front of other and later payed 100Rs to me and said, \" Take as much as you want I don't owe you nothing now.\"Everyone even tho knew about everything sided with her and she started telling them how she is poor and never has money so she takes my help. And how I insult her every time.Everyone told me to stop acting like that with her. I was really hurt. But this same incident happened again and she started crying and this time it was for only 20Rs. I got really frustrated.After few weeks i decided to live solo and leave the pg we where sharing. I asked Sam and she was okay with it but when it was time for me to move she asked me back for 300 something Rs that she owed me and i thought if she could ask me back the money I should do the same.I payed 300 and asked her for 1000 Rs which I payed for her to our landlord as her rent. And this is how I become the asshole in front of my friends as she again started crying and telling all our friends how I am insulting her over money.Am I the real asshole here?? I really want help in this. If I am I would definitely say sorry coz I was not intending to hurt her. Also my friends are siding with her soo...",

I just kinda sat there stunned cause I never expected it. after yelling at me she went to her room and I went to move everything. keep in mind she CONSTANTLY will hurl insults at me if I ask for something or won’t do something for her (usually the ladder as I don’t ask for much and usually will do it myself), and she does it in an even less joking voice to the point most would take it seriously. she went off about how I, as a straight white man, have no right to ever use that word in any context even though she has heard me use bitch or bitchy with no problem AND she’ll also call people the same very seriously. I even heard her refer to someone as a bitch later that night. I’ve never once heard her oppose anyone saying it unless using it very aggressively directly towards people they don’t know, our if she’s opposing the overall tone.I just wanna know if i’m in the wrong? I know different words do have deeper history and I would NEVER curse at someone if I didn’t know them closely and knew that it was normal to them, however it has been thrown around in all our vocabulary regularly so I assumed it was fair play within our family especially since she’s called me a bitch before.

She agreed that this way completely reasonable, and so did my best friend (let's call him Ben). On the day of, the competition lasts a bit longer than I thought it would and I am absolutely exhausted, so I text in the group-chat with Ben and our friend and say that I am too tired, but I hope they have a great time. The other friend that she invited cancelled as well, so at this point, it is just going to be Ben and the birthday girl (let's call her Amanda).Here's where things get a little bit complicated. I have had a crush on Ben for all of high school, and while he has always acted in a romantic way towards me (holding hands, cheek kisses, cuddling, hugs from behind, etc), he has denied having those same feelings towards me every single time I have brought it up. This has always frustrated me because of the mixed signals he constantly gives me, but I tried my best to be respectful of the fact that he doesn't want anything with me in that regard. For the past few months, however, he has been acting flirty towards Amanda. I have teased him about it a few times, but that is the extent of our conversations about her.After the hangout, I get a text from him saying, 'I actually fucking hate you.' My heart sinks in my chest, so I ask him what he means, and he accuses me of cancelling on the hangout to try and set him and Amanda up with each other. This was not the case, and I explained that to him, but the fact that he was so quick to be so nasty towards me over something so small really hurts my feelings. He says that he feels like he can't trust me anymore because of this.So, AITA? I don't think I'm out of line, but it seems that his feelings were really hurt by what I did.

I'm 17 but in college doing this program to get my AA and diploma that's hella stressful, not only that but there a lot of stuff going on in the world not and it already feels like the odds are against and I don't want to further induce my stress worrying about what I should eat, most organic stuff is expensive any way and we DON'T have money.I understand the need to eat healthier and maybe the people around you but she continually forces her opinions on me. What ever she's doing i have to do, when she found out i didn't watch she said i never listen to anything she say's but that quite the contrary.I clean the house, When something gets broken I fix or help her find someone to fix cause she'll ignore it, I get good grades in school, I got a job so then i can stop making her life harder and pay for things like deodorant, lotion, toothbrushes, toothpaste, laundry stuff, clothes/shoes. I do everything she says and in return, she talks about me to her girlfriend (sometimes in front of me either way i can hear we have thin walls), Talks about how shit my dad is, \"these kids this, these kids that\", often yells at me, actually has yelled at me her whole life, especially when's she pissed, then askes why I'm always defensive even though when something happens she has an accusatory tone that she can't seem to hear.She thinks I'm just like my dad, but wait she totally hates my dad (they get along but she does NOT like him), makes fun of his accent, and thinks that everything i do is purposely to make her angry, get on her nerves, or to make her life harder.

She called me rude, and for the sake of my peace of mind and trying to have a good day, I left. She came back and said she wanted to talk about what happened. She said that she doesn't asks for space often and she felt that that gave her the right to have it whenever she liked. Fair point but you can take space whenever you like. Also that doesn't give her the right to do it WHERE-EVER she liked. After I began making these points she started to raise her voice at me. I said the conversation was over because I do not tolerate that kind of behavior.So we share a room, and that night she wanted to move some of her stuff around. She asked me if she could do that and if she could move my stuff around as well. I told her that I do not feel comfortable with her touching my things and that I would do it later. She asked me when I would do it, and I just said in a bit because at this point I had to go fix the wifi router.

I really emphasized that she cannot touch my things and she just rolled her eyes at me. At this point my shit had been touched, my boundaries crossed, and disrespect was given and it really didn't seem like she cared at all or was even sorry. So when she came to me the next day to ask her to re-pay her for a coffee we had gotten (literally 3 euros), I told her no and that it was a fine for touching my things and going through my personal belongings.

So I completely cut my contact with that guy. I tried to mend my relationship but it is a big scar in my relationship till now. So today what happened is that I just asked my bf to share his screen just to check what is my name in his phone and see the goofy pics he took of mine during video call. At that time I saw a pic of a girl in his gallery. I asked him who is she, he said she is my elder sister the picture was not completely visible. But by mistake he clicked on that picture and I saw the contact name. She was not her sister but a screenshot of status of one of his friend(abby).

For instance, I live in texas and she lives in California, but we have met many times and have gone on many trips together.we video call pretty much every day. Every  night we spend time together talking, watching something, or play games. Shes a funny girl who makes me laugh and creates plans for us and she also helps me sometimes financially. However there's some factors that affect that.For instance, she gets really agressive over certain things. Especially when she is on her period, she excuses that its her period making her yell at me when i make a simple joke or do a simple mistake. There's other times like this to but i always try to be understanding of how she feels. She is also passive agressive where i am having a conversation with her in which she responses back very condescending..She has stated she has depression too. She says \"i hate my life\", \"i am so overwhelmed\", \"i am sad\" almost all the time and i have tried to be there for her but it's really hard when she is projecting how she feels on me.And because of all of this, i finally decided to tell her today as she was asking me why am i acting differently recently. She asked \"where is your support? All i want is to feel your support\" and so i started with that i have been questioning the relationship. Unfortunately this was cut short as her mom called her saying her grandma is in the hospital as she had a heart problem. We later resumed our conversation in which i felt even more bad because her grandmas in the hospital. At first i wasn't holding back since i know shes under alot of stress but she kept insisting and told me its okay to communicate what i have to say. And so ultimately i told her about her depression, her being passive agressive all the time, and how she handles certain situations. She made excuses for each thing i explained to her saying its something i need to adapt to and that i cant change her depression and that only she can which i understand. Feeling like she just didnt take much of what i said.... i told her i am sorry. I understand all of youre saying. I really wanna work this out but rn i feel two sides of me telling me we can work this out and another telling me to just leave, that i am not ready.She didn't like this and she told me that i was a coward then and that she didn't want me then if thats how i think. I remained silent the whole time but she called me a piece of shit for saying that, that i betrayed her, and then hung up and its been almost a whole day since ive spoken to her.So, did i mess this up?

	"body" : "On mobile forgive any errors. I (m) (ages don’t matter), work in the disability industry in a group home. We recently had a new worker join our house (f, not new to industry). I have worked with her on two shifts. First shift I thought she was fantastic, fresh faced, bubbly and attentive; everything you need in a coworker. Second shift she was shut in the office with the door closed for an hour and 20 minutes after I started my shift. The rest of the shift was her on her phone, quiet, barely talking to clients and staff, moving between the office, lounge rooms and kitchen. She was entirely unapproachable and reserved and did not communicate what she needed if anything. She is also very frequently calling in sick to many shifts - I don’t have an issue with using personal leave, but our industry is very understaffed so finding replacements is difficult; so I now see her as unreliable. Among the rest of the staff we talk about everything, other staff included, everyone talks about everyone; it’s just the way the industry is. We all want to know what everyone else’s experience is with each other so we can aim to work better, and also to know if they are good to the clients. Anyway it got back to her that I was “gossiping” about her, and she took great offence, called our manager crying etc. Keep in mind we all talk about each other. More context is that I have never bought her up in a conversation, as I don’t know her well enough to initiate any conversation about her with others. But when I’m in that situation I talk about my experience with her; the positive and negative; always my truth. So now I’m in mediation with her and my manager and I want to know if what I did is deserving of an apology. However, I do not believe it’s possible for me to only not talk about her in conversations involving other staff when we talk. So AITA that I talked about her with my other coworkers?",

And I didn’t understand because I didn’t notice any stench to the towels and they were wet so I assumed they could go into the dryer. Little did I know my dad used them to clean up a leaking mess. She then yells at me telling me I’m worthless and I shouldn’t dry random clothes and I should have SMELLED THEM. I then tell her that it’s insane to smell clothes and if they were left there and smelt bad I would have noticed.

I have only met Mark and Alyssa a few times in a group settings but we haven’t talked much in the group. Two nights ago they come over to our house along with Bubble’s other sister. We are all talking and Mark mentions his new job at WingStop and we all jokingly ask if we can get free food. He mentions that with other restaurants they will sometimes trade food. I work at a well known steakhouse down the street. Last night I get off work around 11. At that point there is only about 3 places open and I decide to stop by WingStop to grab food for me and my roommate. The fact that her brother worked there was an afterthought. When I walk in I see him in the back cooking so I nod to him and say hey, he nods back then goes to the back of the restaurant where I can’t see him. I order my food, wait, and then leave. This morning I wake up to a text from his girlfriend Alyssa. She says that me showing up to his place of work unannounced made him uncomfortable and was disrespectful. She says that she wants to set a boundary since they don’t have opposite sex friends in their relationship. I share this with my roommate and she tells me that Alyssa asked for my number the night before under the pretense that she wanted to send me something real quick and that it was good to have in case something were to happen and they needed to get ahold of us. I respond to Alyssa saying that I apologize for making him uncomfortable. I explain that there is not much open at that hour and in my mind if I didn’t say hi that would be disrespectful. She then responds repeating how it was weird that I showed up and that it would’ve been ok if I came with bubbles since we are friends and that is his sister. I said it was good to have boundaries but that I won’t be announcing when I plan to go somewhere to someone I barely know. She had brought up the free food thing so I explain that we had been joking and that I never asked for anything from him, that I simply said hi so that hopefully we could all be on a good standing bc I assume they would be coming over more in the future-which is now not happening. I stated that next time I wouldn’t say hi and that I will go there again at some point and this is my only warning. She says it’s ok to go to WingStop and that she just wanted to set a boundary, I ask her what her boundary is exactly since nothing else happened. She says that I shouldn’t expect free food and that was her only point. Meanwhile my roommate texts her saying she doesn’t appreciate being lied to in order to get my number. She responds saying she meant no hate but that we wouldn’t understand since they are in a “traditional relationship” and that we have different views. To multiple of our messages Alyssa responds with a laughing emoji or lol. My issue is if it was about the free food then why did she mention their traditional relationship and how they can’t have opposite friendships. This isn’t the first problem my roommate and her family have had with her. So my question is- AITA for going to WingStop?",

It was a closed adoption, they didn't even want to tell me the names of my parents until I probed them for answers.I love my adoptive parents, but there are generational divides, it's strange to compare my upbringing to my friends with younger parents. My parents never allow me to dress in anything they consider immodest, make up has to be kept minimal, they insist on taking me to school and then picking me up - I practically have no freedom.They have different views on adoption, they said that since my bio parents didn't raise me, that they shouldn't matter to me and that I shouldn't try to seek them out since that chapter of my life is closed.Not too long ago, my uncle reached out to me, he managed to find me on instagram. I did make sure to find out if he was actually the brother of my dad. I started texting my dad, Llyam (M, 34), and we became close. I had asked my parents if it'd be alright to meet with him in person, which they agreed to if they could come as well. It was awkward with them there, but it was lovely to meet him. He answered every question I had and he tried to put my parents at ease, saying that he wasn't trying to take over, but he'd want a relationship with me.They still don't like him and are uncomfortable with me being close with him.Last Friday, I got into a bad argument with my parents and it resulted with me leaving home. I got the train over to his apartment. It's lush, he lives in a huge, high rise apartment near the center of the city. He and his gf (F30) have even decorated it so it looks like something of maximalism pinterest. He let me in because he couldn't just turn me away, and asked about what was going on.When I told him, he was understanding and let me stay, but he made me call my parents first.

They said that he had no right letting me stay over without permission and that what I did was extremely disrespectful. They said that they forbid me ''coming and going'' and grounded me.

He has a strong personality, he is the only one who can be right about everything, everyone else is stu*id.Since he loves to cook and throw parties, all bigger family events are at their house. He drinks while cooking, which he continues afterwards, he pours alcohol to everyone and he hardly takes no for an answer. He usually gets drunk (but not like totally drunk) by the time we get to the food. And that's where it all goes wrong.He is constantly criticizing everyone, mumbling, invalidating other people's feelings or preferences, but even on the most insignificant things, like someone liking chicken, because he thinks it's not a proper meat. I always get very upset when he starts this behavior, but I never say anything. Neither do anyone else, we just put up with it. You just can’t argue with him, we all know that.Last time, however, it got to the point where he wanted to shut down a topic he didn't like (he doesn't think there is or should be solidarity, everyone s*its on each other anyway. He is a doctor so it’s even more incomprehensible.), and my mum said he was wrong and society should look after people in need.After a few minutes he stood up and pointed at my mum and told her to stop right now. End of conversation, he didn’t want to hear about this nonsense.No one said anything and I got so angry. No one dare point fingers at my mom or anyone else. I almost stood up too and said something nasty, but I didn't. On what basis does he shut another person down (especially family) and point fingers?  He is like a petulant and stubborn child.I don’t think that I could hold my frustration back anymore. We have this scene almost every time we go over. Next time like this, I will explode, I’m sure. I already have a whole monologue in my head to snap back at him, but I’m afraid that it would ruin our family. Or he would send me home/never invite us anymore or worse. I also feel sorry for my aunt whom I really love and my very old grandma lives next door too.Other times, when he is not drunk, he is quite normal, helpful and funny and usually doesn’t remember these conversations.I'm fed up with this situation and that nobody is doing anything, but maybe they are more experienced and know that it is not worth it. My dad told me to let it go and not argue, but my sense of justice and anger are so strong.So, WBTAH if I open my mouth next time?",

But in other hand my bf moved just 15 mins far from his childhood home. Now to the point. Since we mooved his family just invite us over a lot. And I get upset, because it is not comfortable for me to be every week invited for lunch/dinner or just some family things like b-days and so. I even get sometimes angry, mainly cause I can not be with my family but also because I just sometimes don’t wanna see his mom.His mom really loves to argue, even when u proof her wrong. We had some issues together and I never got over it. I struggled with ED and she told me that if I do not like her food to just not visit them, loudly. I was very emotional, my mistake, and told her i had ED, also loudly and in tears. She told me that it is imposible, since just really skinny girls can have ED… I’m not fat or anything, but I’m not skinny as girls with ED in late fase. We talked and everything but it is still inside me and sometimes I remember and get angry. It get back mainly if she invite us to eat…So tell me gyus. Any advice is welcome.",

But even though im young i was diagnosed with depression when i was 12 from severe bullying from ages 6-12ish, it stopped when i went to highscool. I know i sound selfish, and my mum has said i am being selfish. But my best friend says im reasonable.  But for the last few years my birthday has just reminded me of shitty stuff i wont go into, and i havent had the energy to ever be excited for it (along with Christmas and other holiday's). But this year is different. Since going to highschool i have found my group, healthy relationship, but the only problem is my mums boundaries. Which im working with a therapist for. Now im sorry if the lay out is confusing, my apologies. But onto the story.So me, and family, and my mums side (cousins, aunts and uncles) all go on a big trip just for newyears. And this year my Aunty came to, me and my family were leaving the next day and i was saying goodbye, when she asked me, \"Am i going to see you for Grandma and grandpa's 60th?\" I asked when it was, and she continued with \"(Weekend of my birthday)\" i was a little shocked bc my parents hadnt told me, and its been in the plan for months it seems. But i smiled and said \"Yeah i will be.\" I was a little sad and brough it up to my mum and dad that night, which i was told \"Dont talk about it.\" And \"It doesnt matter.\" So i left it. I brought it back up a few days later and i was shut down by my mum with the words, \"We are going and theres no discussion.\" I just agreed and asked questions, like: \"what day are we celebrating.\" Which i was told my birthday, they are celebrating it on my birthday, which i was annoyed about. But i let it go. Today i followed up with mum asking \"Can i go stay at a friends for that weekend?\" Again told a no, and words along the lines of: \"No, you are not missing your grandparents moment, this is really big for them.\" I asked \"More important then my day, i would atleast like the day about me, just one day of the year.\" Which she continued with, \"We can celebrate (My birthday) the next day,\" i forgot a lot but i heard the words selfish. I dropped it again. But i dont know if im being an ass, i mean, i love my grandparents, but they make me uncomfortable to not want to be around. And that goes for my whole family. My cousins and all. I dont get along with any of them, being the youngest while the rest of my cousins and my brother are adults, the only one that isnt an adult acts like shes 25.I feel selfish and i dont know what to do anymore, and i feel like shit. I just want one day about me. Sorry if this is long, i just needed an outside opinion. Again, i know 14 isnt a big number, but i really think this is for myself.

My mother belittles and makes fun of a different sister, and she is currently not talking to me because I do not participate with her comments.Years ago I took on a public role within my community - a remote small town. This experience was very meaningful to me because of who I am.. ‘That sister’ - out of nowhere - decided to take on the same role, then choosing to have her endeavor involve a person from my town. Even though we had not spoken in 5 years at that point, ‘that sister’ chose to link herself with my town at least 600 miles from her own. Because of the endeavor,  ‘that sister’ became intertwined with Luke. Luke and I were not friends per se but shared social circles. I had known and cared for Luke (way more than I had known, cared for or interacted with ‘that sister’ for over 10 years). ‘That sister’ did this without my knowledge; my mother informed me about ‘that sister’s connection to Luke.Fast forward a couple years… ‘that sister’ and Luke had a terrible falling out. ‘That sister’ trashed Luke in her own small community where Luke has family and friends. ‘His relationships with his own family and friends were strained because of ‘that sisters’ talking about him in her town. ‘That sister’ often lies and will lie when she is mad or to win an argument. A few years ago, I ran into Luke after not seeing him for a while. He expressed pain and exasperation about the situation with my sister. In empathy for him, I shared with him that I had not talked to or seen ‘that sister’ in over a decade, and that my sister was ruthless in how she fought with everyone. Luke relayed that info to ‘that sister’, which was understandable.Because my mother is mad at me about Lily, my mother is now declaring that I am not a loyal person and that I owe ‘that sister’ an apology. My mother has excluded me from her life based on this past incident which ‘that sister’ may have again mentioned to her again.I feel like my mother and ‘that sister’ are 100% really dysfunctional, and that given that this is the landscape of my relationships with my mother and ‘that sister’, that I really don’t want to be resolving anything, that instead, firm boundaries are in need because there is no way to have truthful conversation.

If I don't respond quickly, my family and friends will message me on all my social media platforms. My sister messages me saying she's had enough of me either not responding straight away or within an hour or two, not responding at all, or taking ages to respond. My sister said it's rude and aholeish.She was so mad that she'd put up a rant on Facebook and tagged me to see the post. All my friends were commenting on the post, saying they thought I was rude for not responding within two hours. Many have said they texted me in an emergency, and I didn't respond till later. I looked back at these messages and all of them aren't actual emergencies. If someone was dying or hurt I'd respond straight away. One of my friends commented the other day saying he texted me in an emergency, which was if I want a takeaway when I'm at his and if so, what? To him, that's an emergency, but to me, it wasn't.Am I the asshole for not responding to any messages straight away?",

I am quite sure they can convince their mom to take the tortoise, or if they really wanted him they would just bring him where they live and deal with the repercussions there. I have given a hard line on taking the tortoise by the end of January or I rehome him. Would I be the asshole if I rehome the tortoise? This will hurt my ex as he won't see the tortoise anymore.",

This is why I come home on the weekends to try get things done. (mow lawn, Assemble shed, painting, fixing doors etc)The issue is, I mostly come home on a Friday to a house that is filthy. Always dishes and food left out, floors aren't vaccumed, bins aren't taken out (smells) His laundry is just sort of everywhere, doesn't really have a system in place to put it anywhere. Grass in the yard just keeps on growing and growing taller.Usually I end up cleaning this mess, but it feels like it doesn't end. By the time Ive driven 2+ hours on Friday night and done some dishes. I feel drained and it's hard to crack on with the actual jobs for the house.I've explained to him all year how I feel about this and that it's stressing me out and making my life harder. I've offered to list jobs for him to do on a whiteboard on the fridge but still never gets done.Our Mother used to clean up alot so I think it's a hard habit for him to shake but none the less the outcome is the same and every Friday and I still come home to a stinky house!feel more and more bitter with him (which i don't want to)  but I'm not sure how to actually help him take a bit of initiative or shared sense of pride in our home?I guess his idea is that he works his computer all day with his business and that I'm just being a clean freak making him do this and that. Realisticly he also wouldn't have the same incentive as me to clean or look after the house as he's there rent free.Anyway he asks why I'm not coming to his barbeque on Saturday and I said because i feel upset and disrespected by you.

Which she is very against saying that the guy we just talked with will think that we’re following him (which is a little silly) so she suggested that we ask to use the staff bathroom in the convenience store. And we kinda went back and forth, and couldn’t really agree, so I suggested that she goes into the convenience store and I got to mall (its right beside each other).She then gets very annoyed with me and says “FINE, but this is the last time I got with what you are suggesting”We then head over to the mall, which is only like a 2 minute walk. We then find out the toilets are closed. So I said “it’s okay, we’ll just find a toilet, another place” and then she got very angry with me and started saying “no it’s not okay!! I told you it was a dumb idea and you still insisted and now I really have to pee!!” I then got an uncomfortable and nervous so I said “it’s okay” and she took that as me saying it’s okay that she really has to pee?So she said “are you saying that it’s okay that I’m about to piss my pants!?” And got even more angry with me. To which I was very confused and didn’t really know what to say, and she was just getting more and more angry. So I told her that I was really uncomfortable with how angry she was getting.She then gets even more angry and starts cussing me out for making her seem like some crazy angry person, and I kind of panicked and tried my best to calm the situation down and I said “can’t we please talk about this? Like communicate” (and I will admit it maybe wasn’t the best to say, but I was doing my best) and then she got even more angry and told me she didn’t want any of my therapist bullsh*t and then she left saying that she thinks I’m really weird and that other people think the same.And now she’s talking about me behind my back and saying people she probably will forgive me and be friends with me, since I don’t have any friends(?).I personally think the situation is very childish and I’m just tired of being scared of her short temper.

I do admittedly spend most of my free time with him and we’re apart for about 2 days once a week for the past month or so.My roomates have gotten to the point that if I’m at his house they’re texting and calling me about how I need to come home and when I do come home start screaming matches about about how I’m never there. After we had a  conversation about 2 weeks ago i attempted to make changes.The weekend before last I made plans for me and my roomates to out. He spent the night Friday and I woke him up to kick him out at 12:20 pm Saturday  (let me be precise since she brought up the exact time in an argument) and she was upset that it wasn’t soon enough. We spent all of Saturday together had a sleep over and spend most of Sunday together. I left for his when she said she was going to her room at 7 pm, but she was still upset i was going to his house.I ended up getting sick and spent Monday there to, then Tuesday was a bad storm that cancelled work then i home on Wednesday. He did come over on ThursdayThis past weekend we went out together Friday and this time he went with us because they invited him. The 21F (the one who’s most upset) went on a date and told us she’d meet up but never did. I did sit in her room for two hours in the morning so we could talk about the date before she left to visit family until Sunday. She did not ask about my night. When she left for her family I went to his house until Monday (a holiday) which of course upset her.I  came home Tuesday but was sick and staying in my room. She came in to tell me i shouldn’t have come home if i was sick so i went back to his, which upset her. She called and shouted at me for a solid 10 minutes about how bad of a friend i was and how it’s personal. She never asked how i felt or if i was okay.Her stance is still that i don’t care about her but in this entire two weeks she has not had a single conversation with me that was not about how I’m a terrible friend, chores that need to be done (which I’ve done), or the guy in her life after she’s sufficiently yelled at me. She has not asked a single question about how anything I’ve got going on is going yet I’ve asked her constantly about her family, work, and love life.So at this point I can’t tell if I’m the ah and I can’t see it or she is and i don’t know how to approach the situation anymore.",

A staff appreciation dinner then a Holiday party - where the staff and couples from that year come together and celebrate. The staff dinner is 2 days away and I was just asked if I wanted to bring my mom with to the party so the teams are even for games. I am literally the only single staff member, there are only a handful of staff and they are married. I was asked to bring my mom because the owners met her previously (She babysat their children) and they are aware I'm single. This is my first year working there and I have been single the entire time so not sure how the owners \"forgot\" I'm single until 2 days before? I also think it's awkward that I wasn't asked to bring someone so that I'm not alone...I was asked to bring someone so that teams are equal. I didn't think it was that big of a deal. Long story short my mom isn't able to go so I said I would see about finding a plus one. I have been chatting with this guy for about 2 weeks and we went on 1 date - he is very nice but I don't know if I know him well enough to have to come to my work event with me? Especially an event that I wasn't aware \"required \" a plus one. He knows about the whole situation and is willing to come with me but not sure if it will be weird?So far it's two options 1. Go solo or 2. Go with Hinge date I met onceBut the story continue, since it's a dinner I asked if they needed me to bring any gluten free item - I was thinking if they had BBQ sandwiches I'd bring bread etc.... Well they completely forgot about my allergies and they are having spaghetti and bread sticks and salad....so I can have salad... And yes there were very much aware of my allergies I was actually given a gluten free treat basket earlier this year after a surgery. - plus the dessert is also not gluten freeSo more options.A - Go alone - eat a side saladB - Go alone - bring my own spaghettiA - Bring Hinge date - eat side saladB - Bring Hinge date - bring my own spaghettiThe Hinge date can eat the regular food but I feel weird going to a party that's supposed to be an appreciation dinner and bringing my own food. Also the staff alternate working the weddings I have only met some of the other staff occasionally and some not at all, so I'm not close with the other staff. Which bring me to options #5 at this point I don't feel like going to either party - because I don't want to have to bring a random guy and bring my own food.So WIBTA if I just replied and said I'm not coming? Since it's a small party it will definitely be noticeable that I'm not there - and the Holiday party I'm supposed to go to say Hi to the couples I worked with, but now I just don't want to, it seems like a hassle. Despite this situation the owners are wonderful to work for and extremely sweet so I don't want to make this look negative on myself for not attending.",

	"body" : "My husband(31) is a professional painter. Recently he offered to paint a few friends houses for deeply discounted rates. Two of these were a couple in which we are closer with the husband. After planning the job (normal price was $5,000 we charged $2,000), everyone found out that Erica, 30 was cheating on Chris, 36. For character background, Chris is a stellar guy, fun to be around, and friends with nearly everyone in our small town. Erica is attractive, charming but also controlling and known for getting people fired from her job. Because the supplies were ready to go we chose to continue and “not take sides” until the project was done. Once caught, Erica decided to make a last minute 11 day trip to an unknown location. She assumed Chris would stay home and watch the dogs but he refused because he felt like she was taking advantage of him by cheating, not answering his calls or messages, and skipping town. He did offer to feed and walk them every day but she wanted someone there overnight and he felt uncomfortable sleeping there. She asked us if we would spend 9 nights sleeping at their house and watching their dogs for free while we painted, we said sure.When we got there, we noticed that she had not pulled everything off of the walls like we had asked. Most painters will not begin work until your stuff is moved and they will not put your things back up either. She apologized so we decided to continue because they are “dealing with a lot”. We spent hours taking down decorations and 8 heavy wooden shelves with cast iron cookware and pottery on top so we could paint. Once the kitchen was done we replaced everything however, it may not have been entirely accurate as we underestimated the amount of things on the shelves. We spent the week painting, walking the dogs, watering the plants, and even cleaned up old dog poop in their backyard. We got paid for the job via Venmo. Once the 9 days were up we swiffered the downstairs, wiped the counters, let the roomba do its thing, and left for a ski trip with mutual friends. We left the bedding on the bed so it wouldn’t mold in the washer. The friends in the ski group were “whistleblowers” in the cheating scandal. Chris also joined the group last minute.Yesterday, my husband texted to ask if Erica was satisfied with the paint. She said the paint job was good but she was “appalled” at the way we left the house. I feel like I’ve been slapped. I don’t think we left the house different than when we arrived and there was no damage done to anything. We asked the person who stayed while we were skiing if he felt like we had left the house a mess and he said no but he thought he saw dishes in the sink. I’m nearly positive we did the dishes but maybe i’m mistaken. We apologized but asked her to elaborate and she has not responded.

	"body" : "INFO: My housemate of 6 months (college friend before) and I have a routine of taking turns buying groceries each week, and having an open fridge policy when it comes to food. Typically what we do is, for example, have me do groceries one week and we split the bill down the middle. The next week Roomie does groceries and we split that bill down the middle. Of course if one of us buys something extra he doesn't want to share that person will cover the cost of the whole item, but otherwise it's 50/50. Overall I like this system and don't mind continuing to do this. But what I do have a problem with is division of labor, I guess I'll call it.My roommate rarely shops in person and prefers to use Instacart for convenience. For the first couple of months we lived together I used to used it too, but after my year subscription ran out I stopped to save money on fees and shopper tip (which still adds up/is kind of pricey in my mind even with the subscription). I've used his account a couple of times when it was my week and I was too busy to shop in person, but 90% of the time I will drag my butt to the store to do it the old fashioned way.The issue I'm running into is that on my week I will put in the effort to shop in person, saving both of us money but costing me time and effort. But on Roomie's week he still orders groceries that someone else shops and delivers to our door, and bills me for half the fees & tip in addition to the groceries themselves. This wasn't a problem when we were both using Instacart, but now it feels a little unfair to me.Granted, he does pay his subscription alone, but the division of labor/costs still feels unfair considering I don't bill him for my time shopping in person. It's a little annoying that he gets the benefit of never needing to shop in person while still saving money from my extra effort to do so.I haven't mentioned any of this to him because I'm afraid I'll sound petty/cheap if I say I no longer want to contribute to his delivery fees. At the end of the day it's like $20 max I'd be saving every other week so it's not the end of the world to continue doing it. Really it's just the principle of the thing, but I'll keep quiet if y'all think it would be petty/assholey of me. WIBTA?",

After about a year, I ended up leaving due to a move across the country.  However, I remained in contact and on good terms with both Val and Sue.About 2 1/2 years ago, I came back to visit and met up with them twice. On both occasions, I was told about the issues they had filling not only my position, but also Sue's position, since she had been promoted. They both told me I should come back and take over Sue's position. Due to illness in my family, I was open to the idea. Sue acted as a facilitator between myself and who would be my boss (who I also knew well from my time at the company). We negotiated several things, but the most important were salary and relocation assistance.When I received the contract to sign, it had no relocation assistance, $12k less than agreed upon, and a lower position than originally discussed. I pulled out, but I still moved back since my fiance had a found job in the area in preparation.Previously, when I worked with Val and Sue, I was an end user on an easy to use software. In my current position, I work on the IT side with a different, fully configurable system that you can customize to your needs. However, it's flexibility tends to make it a little complex and finicky, which leads many companies to hire entire teams to configure and maintain it's multiple modules.Since the negotiations fell through 2 1/2 years ago, things have been a little weird with Val and Sue. We barely talk, but the biggest issue had been that I invited both to various events including my wedding. For each event, Val would switch her RSVP to no at the last-minute. Sue on the other hand would RSVP yes, then just never show up. After my wedding, I just decided to cut my losses and move on.That was until their company decided to move to the same software that I use. Suddenly, Val started texting every week about how she wants to see me and is scared of the software. Now they have implemented it, and she has NO IDEA how to use it. In fact, she hasn't been able to do her job at all since they switched, Sue has had to do it all.Val asked me to sit down with her this weekend and go over how to use the software so that she can better do her job. I initially said yes, but now I'm thinking of canceling. My husband insists they are using me. Training on this software is not cheap for end users, like $4000 per person for 1 week of training on the basics of Val's specific role.

	"body" : "I apologize if my post if too much for such a small issue. My family has a history of being people pleasers. They don’t like to rock the boat, will say fake nice things so others will enjoy being around them. For a long time, I was the same. I mean, everyone ants to be wanted, right? A few years ago, I was so unhappy because I let anyone walk all over me. I tried so hard to meet their needs that I let mine be non-existent. Since then I’ve done a lot of soul searching. Life is short. I no longer keep quiet when I feel like things are wrong. I speak up. On that note, onto the story. My SIL (I’ll call her Julie) has had a history of making up extravagant lies. When she first started seeing my brother, she emailed my mom about some VERY detailed abuse she’d had growing up. My mom was super worried and wanted to make sure she was ok. In the email, Julie has said that her therapist had told her to email a trusted friend about it. Julie included the therapists name. After a few emails back and forth, Julie’s story would change. She escalated the situation enough to where my mom felt she needed to reach out to the therapist. Turns out there was no therapist. Confused, my mom asked Julie what was going on. Through a lot of prodding, she discovered Julie made the ENTIRE thing up. She had a happy childhood. Loving family. My mom was hurt. After a while, she let it go. Since then, Julie was had a slew of illnesses. Her kidney was failing, she had to take chemo for some sort of disease she has, had to be on a constant IV drip for another thing. Just…extreme things. Knowing what had happened with my mom, I took everything she said with a grain of salt. I had no proof any of it was fake and was not about to call her out only to have her really be sick. And I’m an insensitive asshole. Now the part where I might be an asshole. Shes moved away now but I am friend with her on social media. She always makes posts about how good her kids are at sports, throwing 90mph pitches when one is 7 years old, etc. she then made a end-of-school post about how her oldest grew 9 inches in 9 months. Which is A LOT. She even made a comment on it saying she had her husband measure TWICE! Cut to three months later when she made another beginning-of-school post. This one saying his height was 7 inches shorter than the end of school. So I spoke up. I said “he shrunk 7inches?” To which she replied “yeah, my husband mismeasured. He only grew 6 inches last year.” I then said “those measurements still don’t add up.” She didn’t reply. I was proud I said something. I think she should have been called out. Even though I feel like it was a tiny thing. The next time I saw my mom she looked at me disappointed and said “that wasn’t very full of grace.” Honestly that hurt me a lot. So..was I an asshole?",

	"body" : "My husband began working with a woman about two years ago. She consistently called him for his help on a daily basis. I found it was a little unusual and I then saw (we share devices/accounts) that he and his colleague were messaging each other 10-15 times a day. Nothing sexually inappropriate but like two best friends. He was constantly coaching her in her job and her life, giving her advice, checking to see if the workload was overwhelming. I confronted him and he said he agreed it was inappropriate and that he would nip it in the bud and not to worry, he’d never blow up our marriage. So he started delayed responding or not at all. This actually made her message even more. To the point that she would claim at least 2-3 times a week that she didn’t know what time she started her shift and needed him to tell her. He would answer every time. (Their schedule is posted at the workstation.) He started silencing her messages because it was every weekend, every shift she worked without him — daily! He even silenced her on our vacations so we wouldn’t be interrupted because he didn’t want to fight and didn’t trust she wouldn’t reach out. One day he flat out told her (after nearly a year of this) that she messages him a little too often and his wife finds it odd. She claimed she had no idea and apologized. Ok, I gave her the benefit of the doubt. After this, she slowed down but still found a way to need his help every week. She started messaging him only when she knew he was at work. In an effort to minimize fighting, he was deleting messages and lying to me about her contacting him. I went on a business trip and the day I was away, she messaged him on his day off needing help. He called her via What’s App so it wouldn’t appear on our statement and stayed on the phone almost an hour helping her do something he and everyone he knows did independently. I checked his phone when I got home. He had deleted it from his What’s App but not his call log. I flew off the handle. He claims he only hides stuff from me to preserve the relationship. The lying has broken the foundation of our trust because I constantly caught him and now I don’t know how to move on. We have a family and have been together for nearly two decades. We never had a lack of trust before this and I honestly thought we had the perfect life. Now I feel like everything is changed. Them working together causes me constant stress. I feel like I can’t trust him and I know this woman will do anything to get into his life. I feel like the only solution is for him to switch branch (easy to do) to get her out of our daily scenario. He loves his job so much. He has agreed to move and says he feels bad to leave but once he gets used to the new place, all will get back to normal. I feel bad. I don’t want him to hate it there and resent me. If he stays, I fear I can’t trust him and my resentment will grow. I don’t know…AITA, him? Both of us?",

We intended on having a small wedding with just close friends and family, however my family is very large. In total our guest count will be just under 60 people.During John’s family’s dinner we were discussing the guest list, when Martha (FMIL) brought up Jane (FSIL&MOH) and her plus one. I pulled John aside to discuss how I am uncomfortable with an open plus one for the following reasons:-Jane is not currently interested in anyone. If she did start dating someone we would have no problem inviting them, it’s just the idea of bringing someone we haven’t met just to bring someone-I am socially anxious and being around strangers in general is hard for me let alone showing PDA in front of them.-Jane will be busy all day and sitting with us at the reception. I don’t want a stranger sitting at the head table with us and our families and being in every picture, and I don’t see a point in having someone there just for them to be alone the whole time-We are trying to keep the wedding as small as possible and there won’t be a whole dance or anything she’d need a partner for-No one else is getting an open plus oneJohn agreed with me and we decided to talk to her one on one later. However, when FFIL (Henry)  brought up her plus one again I was visibly anxious, he saw something was up and kept pushing me to say something. I told him I’m not comfortable with an open plus one. He then argued with me about it in front of Jane. Jane left, obviously hurt. We talked with her later and she understood, but my in laws were still furious.Henry said I should give her a plus one because what if she meets someone she wants them to meet? Martha said I was being selfish and asked why I brought up the guest list in front of Jane if I didn’t want her to have a plus one. I tried explaining that I was not expecting that at all, and it was pried out of me. Henry said I was being too sensitive.I tried to clarify that I’m only uncomfortable with an open plus one, and if there’s someone she meets we would be happy to invite them. They were still angry when the conversation ended.Martha now wants to meet me for lunch, and idk if I can handle my own and defend my position again. I’m not sure it’s even worth the tension if it will just make me uncomfortable for one day, even if it should be just about John and me.So, AITA for not giving Jane an open plus one?",

He continued to tell me, how this girl had a boyfriend and everybody knew, but they were still teasing him. I didnt know how to respond to that, so I said \"oh yes, I like to compliment people too\" and he said \"but you never compliment me\". I replied with \"there should be something that is compliment worthy\". He got offended and said I was rude. I told him, that I compliment when I find something, that stands out(something out of ordinary, like a unique color or accessory). He said, but it is still rude. I tried to explain it was only regarding his dressing sense, but we came back home, and he rushed to his room.Today, I met him in the living room and saw he was upset and asked him, \"what happened\",  And he said \"nothing, im not talking because I'm not worthy to talk to you\". I didnt understand, and asked \"what, why do u think so\" and remembered he was implying to yesterday's conversation. I just told him, i never said unworthy to talk, but just remarked about compliments. He said \"you act well\", and before I said anything, just asked me to not say anything further. I said okay, and came back to my room.I saw he also unfollowed me on Instagram.I can't see his perspective, on why he thinks he should get compliments if I dont find his dressing sense compliment worthy. I might've been too blunt, but I didnt know how to respond to, \"you never give me compliments\".Note: I did compliment him a few times on his cooking skills, his guitar skills and his voice(he sings), but never on his clothes.Please tell me, AITA, or is he overreacting.Note: He also said \"you can say anything to me, I never get hurt, exactly 15 mins before I made that comment\"",

This pattern intensified when she was required to find her own living arrangement after our engagement.Every three months, my MIL quits her job for a new one, claiming sexual harassment or mistreatment. However, we've heard from previous employers about instances of stolen money, unexplained job abandonment, and poor performance. These inconsistencies raise concerns about her credibility. Recently, she requested to stay with us while visiting a doctor for a possible brain cancer diagnosis.A few days turned into agonizing weeks, during which my MIL hurled constant belittling remarks and threats at me whenever my husband was out. She even went as far as sending malicious messages to her friends and social workers, falsely accusing me of abusing her, my daughter, and even my husband. I eventually discovered that the brain cancer diagnosis was a complete fabrication, a cruel manipulation to garner sympathy and control. Moreover, I learned that she had been skillfully manipulating my husband through guilt trips and fabricated scenarios, further straining our marriage.After weeks of heated arguments about her inappropriate behavior, we had to ask my MIL to leave. Despite this, she has continued to harass us. She falsely told my employer's wife about an affair with my boss, even though we only work professionally together. She also contacted several family members, spreading lies about my alleged alcoholic abuse, which are completely untrue. We've documented these attempts and blocked her from contacting us directly, but she keeps finding ways to reach out. My husband feels immense guilt over her persistent demands for money and her manipulative tactics that make him feel inadequate. While I offer him my unwavering support, we're considering seeking professional guidance to deal with this ongoing harassment and protect ourselves emotionally.This entire ordeal has caused me immense emotional distress and strained my relationships.

I knew he had a ton of work he was behind on and told him repeatedly that he can go home. He insisted on staying.Over the next few days he was really great, visited daily, brought me a blanket, flowers, clothes, food, checked on my cat a couple times (at my request). I thanked him every time, told him the blanket made my visit better, that I loved the flowers and every nurse was commenting on them, etc. When he visited he’d stay about 30 mins before I told him to go home to do his work.I finally got out and called him to pick me up. I asked to stay at his place for a bit since Im not supposed to be driving and wanted observation. He was ok with it. We had a tiff that evening when I said I had a headache & he told me that’s not possible since I don’t have nerves in my brain & that my stroke was so small I’m probably imagining it. I explained it is possible and very common, and asked him to not minimize my experience. He started to raise his voice in defense and I calmly said that I will not deal with being yelled at right after a stroke. He apologized & said he was trying to make me feel better & then left.When he got home he was visibly annoyed. I told him I wasn’t mad and asked what’s wrong, he broke down and said he was stressed about his work. I told him it was ok to take a break to eat and take a nap, to tell his work that I had a stroke & it would be ok, that there was no need to stress so badly. I said I’d have my mom fly out and stay with me to give him space so he can work.He woke me up in the morning with all kinds of food (not sure if I thanked him since I was so out of it but I was clearly happy and praised his choices) then tried to stay out of his way and do some puzzles (to help my brain) while he worked. Later, I asked him to take me to pick up my meds. Again, he was annoyed and asked why I picked a CVS that was 6 mins away instead of a closer one, and if it would be a regular thing. I assured him it was a one time pickup and thanked him for taking me. Once home he was still visibly annoyed so again, I asked what’s wrong. To which he said that he feels like I’ve been unappreciative towards him, that he’s gone out of his way a lot, and that I didn’t comfort him appropriately last night.I told him I do appreciate him but also I just had a stroke & I don’t have the mental capacity to deal with him sulking around & having to manage his emotions. I need to be focused on my cognitive therapy to make sure I have the best recovery possible. I told him I’d be getting an Uber home and I hope he got his work done. He said he didn’t want me to be alone & I said I’d rather be alone than deal with drama.So now I’m home alone, & my mom is buying a last minute ticket to come stay with me.

I've always been mildly uncomfortable around this friend, but I've always made the effort to be their friend and nice even when they've been otherwise rude to me. In the past this friend as always made very toeing the line of racist energy jokes, but nothing too crazy or insane.

Recently however, this friend and I and my best friend got in a car together and she actually started getting really racist. Saying \"I hate Chinese people,\" \"shutup darkie,\" \"shutup you're literally fillipino,\" \"stop squinting your eyes\" etcetera.

In the past she's told me she isn't as close to this other friend and us closer to me, but lately she's done nothing but prioritize and hang out with this friend, and didn't even stick up for me in her own car?

Since my hubby and I are earning more than what we need, everyone in the household expect us to cover every thing at home. My uncle would often said that we should be taking care of them since we are living in their house rent free. I am obligue to give, but not my sister.I a paying our  utility bills and groceries. When my sis asked to live with us, she told us they will be sharing with the utilities and will be cooking separately (using my gas stove). But none of this happen. They never shared anything and their children often asked for food from us since their parents dont leave them money for food.  No one is contributing. They are reluctant to share since they knew i am earning several folds their salary.Every day my sis and my uncle have daily deliveries. This bothers me, they said they do not have money to share in the household expences and yet, their online purchases are coming nonstop. i even sometimes paid for these purchases as the package came “unexpectedly early” and they do not have the money to pay for it yet. they never pay me back. My sister and his partner purchase their own vehicle each with monthly ammortization, but never paid me the money they owe me.This has been happening since my mom found out how much money i am earning few years back.Last Oct, I told my mom that we will be spliting the bills starting Jun 2023, I’ll pay 70% of the utilities and will be limitting the groceries too since most of the food we bought were consumed without us knowing it (e.g. foods mysteriously disappeare). I think 70% was fair since the remaining 30% will be divided to 3 families. Came June bill, I asked my mom for their share, she told me to pay for it first and and they will pay me later. The same scenario continue and they never pay me.So when Sept bill came, i stand firm not to pay for it. Hence, when the Oct bill came, we received a disconnection notice. My mom asked if I paid our Sep bill and i told her no, cause I am still waiting for their share. The following day, my sister came and gave half of the Sept bill. So I paid for Sept but not for Oct.

We've had a strained relationship for a good portion of my life, despite him financially providing for me. My parents divorced when I was 15.Onto my dad. He works a difficult job as an executive at a tech company, and brings in at least half a million a year with bonuses. My mother works as an instructor at a local polytech, and we're well-off because of their hard work. He's been very emotionally withdrawn as long as I can remember, and has never told me he loves me or shown any affection. He's never been to a single school event, never driven me to school, never spent time with me, never showed any interest in me/achievements... and so on. Just a guy who lived in my house.My mother is, simply put, a superhero to me. She worked hard my entire life to provide me with a normal childhood and showed up to everything. She even broke her no-contact with my grandpa encourage him to attend my father-daughter events at school so I wouldn't feel out of place. She worked a 9-5, but still made me homecooked breakfast, lunches, and dinner. She tucked me in every night, called out of work to come to therapy with me, always noticed when something was wrong and magically made it better.A year the divorce, he started paying more attention to me. This coincided with him seeing a new woman (who is married with kids, and was a source of scandal in the family). This was shortly after I left an abusive relationship, where I was d. He stepped up on providing me with comfort and caring more than he ever did previously (I've had very poor mental health since I began grade school, and he never noticed, despite me having scars and being in hospitals often). He began taking a bigger parental role in my life, despite me living with my mom full time. However, his attempts were always half-hearted and I usually left feeling sour.This spring, I'm getting married to my highschool sweetheart, 20M. He's everything I've ever wanted, and knows about my relationship with my father. When I was worrying about whether I wanted him to be in the wedding party or not, he made the suggestion that my mother walk me down the aisle. I loved this idea, since she practically raised me on her own, and she was the one who also took my fiancé under her wing when we were younger.Yesterday, I had lunch with my father to invite him to the wedding, and he was surprised to hear I was getting married (even though fiancé and I have been engaged for a year, he was invited to the party but didn't attend as he was in Japan on a trip). I bit my tongue about it and let it slide, until he asked when he should arrive to walk me down the aisle. I broke the news to him that he wouldn't be the one doing it, and he got up silently and left. He has since not answered any calls or texts, even from my mom. I'm still planning on having her walk me down the aisle. WIBTA if he was only a guest?UPDATE: There is a character limit here, so the update is on AITAH.",

I visited his flat that he shares with his girlfriend Amy. The problems started when I was helping his girlfriend cook dinner. I tried to make some small talk, but she wasn't really interested. I assumed she was just an introvert and left it at that. Whilst we were eating dinner me and mack were are talking about how shadow and bone were cancelled, I asked his girlfriend if she had ever seen it. She said that it seemed like a dumb show. This shocked me a little, and I think my friend was shocked to I change the subject, but every time I tried to include Amy, she would always give one word answers or be rude. The same happened when Mack tried to include her, too.Eventually, I left and went back to my hotel. The next day, I woke up to a Facebook text from Amy saying that I was a bich and was trying to steal her man. I was very confused and asked her if I said something to imply that. She responded by saying that the way I was acting was very flirty to her boyfriend, and I was being dismissive of her. I reminded her of what she said during the dinner and how she was dismissive to me and Mack, but she just started insulting me.I blocked her, but later on in the day, one of her friends was messaging me saying the same thing. I was really confused about why she was going through the trouble of doing all of this. I ended up taking screenshots of everything and sending it to my friend. He apologised and said that he would talk to her.Later on, I got a message saying that I was a jerk and that they were now in a massive fight over it. I looked at the profile, and it was another one of her friends. I blocked her and then set my account to private. After thinking about it for a while, I brought it up to one of my other friends (Cara), and she said I should have just ignored them from the start instead of telling Mack about it.I feel bad because I know Mac really likes this girl, and I don't want to be the reason that they argue. But at the same time, I don't want to be harassed when I feel like I did nothing wrong. But also, maybe I did, and I just don't realize it.Update 1:So I spoke to Cara again to see what was happening with Mack and Amy, and she told me something surprising. I didn't mention this before, but Cara is also friends with Mack and some other people who I know. It turns out last month they were all hanging out a bar, and I happened to come up in conversation. Mack was apparently really drunk and said that I was his first crush back in primary school for over a year. This made his girlfriend upset because I was going to fit it soon. It turned into a big argument in front of everyone and him promising that we were just friends.I was really surpriand felt a bit bad for Amy so I called up Mack to see if it was true. He was really mad that someone told me so I think that it was true. He kept on asking, who told me and refused to answer any of my questions. I told him I wasn't going to tell him who told me what happened because I didn't want him to blame them. We got into an argument about it, so I just handed up on him.I don't know what to do now. Part of me wants to apologize to Amy, but at the same time, I feel like I don't have anything to apologise for. I really don't know what to do, so if any of you have any advice, please put a comment.",

I laughed and said that I would never touch him or think about him in that kind off way, not in a million years. I said it kind off jokingly but she took offense. She asked if I really thought I was so much prettier than her, that I think she had low standards because she is dating him etc. I said that I did not think anything bad about her, but James is just not my type and therefore I would not go after him. She scoffed and said “sure”.They left after this and James texted me this morning telling me that if I was going to be disrespectful to his girlfriend, he would have to cut me off and that he thought better off me.

	"body" : "My roommate and I both have our names on our lease that was renewed back in Oct 2023 which ends on Nov 2024. We made an agreement with each other that we would each be paying for half of the total monthly rent, and this agreement has been in place since before the lease renewal.At the end of December 2023 he told me he found a better opportunity and would be moving out in January.He told me that if we paid $[x] between the two of us, we could buy out of the lease completely and it would count for our rent payments for 2 months after that (we need a 2 months written notice to terminate the lease.) If that was the case, I told him I wouldn't mind paying for half of it because it would be cheaper for both of us in the long run - mutually beneficial.However, sensing this was total B.S. I spoke with my property manager who clarified that the $[x] is a separate charge and we are still rent responsible for the following 2 months after that notice is given (so March 31st if we gave our notice before the 31st of this month). That made more sense. I do not feel comfortable paying half of the termination fee out of my own pocket simply so he can move out while I stay here.When I expressed to him that I would not pay half of the $[x] just so he can leave, I was told by him that we will \"cross this bridge when we get there.\"He decided yesterday that he would \"help me\" with rent until the end of February. \"Help me...\" meaning that he shows no intention of paying his part of the rent after that point. Keep in mind: his name is still on the lease agreement. If he chooses to terminate the lease sometime in February if a roommate isn't found, our 2-month notice is pushed back to April 31st and we are both still rent responsible until then. That's 2 full months of rent that he has no intention of paying.I am unable to pay the entire rent on my own which means that he will have the face the consequences just as much as I would if he refuses to pay his half. This also means that even though he is searching for a roommate, I am in search of a roommate myself as well simply out of fear and obligation. I do not feel like I should be responsible for not finding a roommate if a roommate is not found. I also recognize that since I cannot pay the rent fully on my own, we will both be legally responsible when he decides to stop paying.So, I am kindly asking if AITA forA) Alerting him that I will not be accepting responsibility for paying the possible termination fee if it was his choice to leave in the first placeB) Letting him know that I will not be accepting responsibility for finding a roommate to fill the spot that he is leaving behind and letting him know that said responsibility is his own",

They all live in a different state than me and I basically act like I don’t have family.My mother has been homeless/motel-living since I was 8 and we don’t get along at all. I was in desperate need of childcare (I work a 9-5) so I called my mother, who at the time was getting kicked out of a motel for non-payment with nowhere to go. The agreement was she would stay with me for two weeks without pay while she finds a room. Then once she moves into a room, I will begin paying her the agreed amount. She took a bus to my home and never looked for a room. I’ve been miserable ever since. She is ghetto and disrespectful. She lines trash outside of the apartment door for hours while I’m at work no matter how many times I say different, she refuses to use things the proper way and then doesn’t care when it breaks, she’s super dirty, starts screaming if you ask her anything about plans to leave, she refuses to do anything I ask regarding my son (like keeping him in his crib for naps, not feeding him certain foods, etc), she makes the nastiest rude comments (“I bet you f**ked to buy that”), we argue constantly and I feel like a prisoner in my own home.

	"body" : "For the past three years, my brother (25 M) and I (22 M) have exchanged Christmas/B-day gifts. We live in Canada and with the housing crisis, moving out isn't really an option. This year, he surprised me with a drone. I Spent $100 on a white Nike cap, brown Raptors Toque, Hat Organizer, and Leafs lanyard. He's always stressed about misplacing his hats and wants more that are my style.I was shocked when I opened the drone gift. I was also worried it was expensive, so I asked how much he spent. He reassured me that he spent a similar amount.However, I couldn't shake off the disappointment and anxiety, as I felt the drone wasn't something I'd use. I belive, he gets me things, he wants for himself. My brother admitted in front of me, my mom, and his girlfriend - that the gifts he buys me - are also something he can wear and use.I acted happy and grateful but my girlfriend sensed my discomfort, knowing this is something my brother would love and that I’ve never shown any interest in.Some Examples (you could skip this):He gave me bright Red 550 New Balances. He already has the exact same for himself in blue “he liked both so much and couldn’t pick so he got the red ones for me” - I later asked for a receipt to make an exchange, no receipt and he has worn them.One b-day he gave me Purple Vans with a “One Piece” design (this is his favourite anime). I enjoy the show but I've NEVER worn anything like this (I have a very minimalistic style, I can provide a link to the shoes). This 100% was something he wanted for himself (no receipt provided). At the time, I felt really bad bc I knew I wouldn't wear the shoes and he would notice. I thanked him for the gift. Later I told him how I felt and asked him to keep the vans (he was very happy and wears them everyday), while I kept my gift to him - a custom “One Piece” poster of his favourite character (he wanted posters for his room this year).For the past 3 years it's just been more of the same. I feel he doesn't put in effort, I ask for a receipt, and my family calls me ungrateful. While my gifts are always so personal to him.My girlfriends noticed this trend and how increasingly rude he's been with me over the years. I don't feel close with him - like she does with her younger brother (4 years apart, we're 3). My gf asked me to make this post bc I've been extremely conflictedMy parents call me ungrateful. Sometimes I think my brother gets me stuff he likes, thinking I'd like it too. However, it's difficult to communicate with my brother. He reacts angrily to simple requests for advice. He says he's a responsible older brother but I don’t even feel close with him. I can give more examples of other shitty things he doesSo, am I being the asshole by always asking for a receipt? And would I be the asshole again, if I ask to return the drone? I know that it will cause an argument/greater rift between us, and how my parents would react.Edit; Thought I'd provide more context about our relationsihp and why I feel so conflicted.I want a better relationship with my brother. Recently, when I think about how he treats me, I get depressed. When I compare our relationship to my gf and her brother (or other brothers), it's night and day. I'm not sure if what I'm thinking is right becuase my family always made me feel guilty.But I've been thinking he genuially treats me like shit. Recently, he wore my suede timberland boots (that I keep in prestien condition) and put a years worth of damage on them in 1 night. This is because I wore his hat. Salt was everywhere, deep scuffs, and creases. He didn't even bother cleaning them with our salt wipes. When we reff hockey together - he yells at me/trys to embarass me in front of our boses and strangers (this only happens w/ him - reffs are supposed to have each others back). I've also I told him nuermous times to stop. Our parents have overheard our arguments and are quick to tell me he doesn't know what he's doing, or just try to get us to stop.When I try telling him how he makes me feel, he literally could not care any less. He completely dismisses/ignores me. been like this since covid. he's also so quick to anger and ingores me to my face when I try talking to him. He acts like he can't hear me (as I stand right in front of him) and continues on his phone.For so long my family always tells me how I'm not responsible, consistently giving me shit. Rarley anything is said to him and they display him as a role model. I feel like this is a breaking point for me, but I honselty think I'm being a pos for feeling upset about his gits.",

But my housemates decided to go to an event on the weekend, and invited our friend, and some others, to stay at our place for the event. I wasn’t going, as I was way too behind with work, and needed to go to the library early on the weekend.I was told by my housemates that our shared close friend would be sharing my bed with me, as they both are sharing a bed with another one of the girls. I was reluctant at first as everyone knows I hate sharing beds as I suffer with insomnia, and I wasn’t going to the event so wasn’t sure why I was now hosting, but sucked it up as she is one of my best friends.Turns out, that the spare bedroom we have wasn’t being used (which I thought it was). Just to caveat, it’s a single bed with a broken mattress so no one wants to stay in it, but is fine for a one night drunken sleepI said to my friend when she arrived, and they were all drinking in the living room having fun, that I’m going to sleep now as I need to be up at 7am, so pls try be quiet when you come into my room - but I also suggested, if you prefer not to be woken up at 7am if you’re staying up late tonight, the spare bedroom is free.She expressed that she was reluctant to stay in there as she has before and it was uncomfortable, but I said I can lay it out with some blankets and pillows to try make it comfy. I reassured her if  isn’t comfy, come into my room multiple times. I then made the bed for her and texted her saying it’s done, but once again no pressure and she’s welcome in my bed.One of my housemates then texted me in the morning saying: I do not appreciate you not being able to do anyone a favour. And I am yet to see you lift a finger for anyone that isn’t yourself.I explained the situation and that our friend seemed to prefer to stay in that bed than in mine as I was waking up for the library, but she said I guilt tripped her and manipulated her. (I think my friend said to my housemate she was pissed off having to stay in the spare bed). I explained it to my housemate and she said I’m not seeing the situation for what it is.So AITA for suggesting my friend stays in the spare bedroom? It seemed it was genuinely her decision, but apparently I guilt tripped her with the ‘I have loads of work to do, and I hate sharing beds’ and that was manipulative.",

When she did this, she was in decent health and of sound mind.  Signing it over was her idea, not mine.For context,  there's me 48/f then I have 2 brothers 53/m (we'll call him Kyle) and 52/m (we'll call him Dex).  Our dad died years ago and after he died I'm who helped and took care of our mom.   I stayed living with her to help her financially and then with medical issues she had over the years.   I never lived there for free and wasn't a freeloader  I helped her with the mortgage, taxes, upkeep/maintenance.  Plus all the other typical expenses of a home.  I could afford my own house but I couldn't help her and do that too.   I gave up a lot so my mom didn't lose her home and I don't regret it.  Getting married wasn't a priority to me but my living situation was often a deal breaker to men and I also gave up having/adopting kids to help her.  If I had kids I was planning to be a single parent from the start by way of adoption or IVF.Houses age and things need replaced/repaired before my mom died I was already making improvements because well ... it needed to be done.  Since she has died...  I renovated a lot.   I updated the electrical system, the kitchen, 2 bathrooms, put in all knew light fixtures, new doors throughout the house.  Then I redid a lot of the yard too.  All of which I paid for myself.  Essentially, I made it my own home and the way I wanted it.  Some of these things were changes my mom wanted that we had planned to do together.\"Dex\" had no issues with our mom giving me the house.   The house wasn't exactly free, when she died she still had a small mortgage left and I assumed that debt plus well, the house needed a lot of work.   Kyle threw a fit though.   Both of them had their own homes.  Kyle would always talk down about the house because it wasn't in great shape, my mom couldn't afford the repairs and couldn't do them herself.  I did what I could over the years when she was still alive.  He only became interested in house when he found out it was worth more than he thought and he didn't want the house, he wanted the money.  He tried to sue me in court to buy out his \"interest\" in the house but his case was dismissed because the house wasn't an asset of our mom's  when she died.I have since sold this house.  It was valued at $75,000 when she died.   It sold for $235,000 recently so I gave my brother each a third of what the value was ... when she died.  I gave them both a check for $25,000.  Most of the rest I used as a down payment on the house I bought.  Dex was happy with that $25,000.  Kyle is throwing a fit that he says I owe both of them $78,000 each for it to be fair/equal.  Yet I put thousands of dollars into the house of which he contributed exactly $0.00.AITA?",

While we were there, my dad decided to take us to one of these spa-pool-relaxation places that are typically near ski-hotels (sorry if I'm not explaining this correctly).We get to this spa and we check in, and after 3 or so hours we decide to leave. We get to the check out reception and my dad is paying. My brother, my dad and I are being charged as adults (anyone over 12 is), but my dad is under the assumption that I will get a student discount.In Germany there is a \"Student\" discount— but my dad thought it meant like anyone who's in high school, but it actually means university student. So clearly there was a language barrier somewhere. My dad starts picking a fight with the woman at the cash register.The woman at the cash register (Laura, as her name tag said), keeps explaining to my dad that in Germany student refers to University student, and \"schüler\" is high school student. My dad keeps disagreeing with her and saying that the discount doesn't explicitly state that it is only a university student discount, and keeps trying to haggle her for a discount.We're standing at the front of the cue, in front of a bunch of other families who are waiting to check out. My brother is typically very aloof and stays out of it, but I was honestly dying of embarrassment at this point and tried to jump in.I told him that Laura was right, and I explained to him (somewhat condescendingly) that Laura was right and he was wrong. My dad is very prideful, so essentially I embarrassed him in front of the woman and the other families. I told him he should just pay the full price because I'm not eligible for any discount. My dad gives me the dirtiest look. He begrudgingly pays the full price and mumbles some colorful words under his breath.After we leave the spa and head to the car, he stops me and points his finger in my face telling me:\"When we are in public, you either agree with me or you keep your mouth shut.\"He was obviously very angry with me for embarrassing him in front of everyone, and it honestly spoiled the rest of the day and vacation because he kept being short with me or huffing and puffing during dinner.My brother thinks I should've kept my mouth shut, but I think I was in the right in trying to humble my dad's attitude.AITA?",

I started posting more often on my stories, mostly funny memes. Occasionally, I would post a selfie of me trying a new hairstyle or makeup look that I really enjoyed. After I posted a story of my gym access card saying it's time to do something for myself, Josh messaged me privately saying \"ok you don't have to post everything on your story\". He went on to say that I should only post good moments on my page, and that \"when I achieve an amazing body then that'll be something worth posting, people will actually commend you for it\".I was taken aback because 1) it's my page and I can post whatever I want, and 2) although he said I can post whatever makes me happy he kept going on about how it's better to follow his method of posting and jokingly offered to be my social media manager. He went through my entire instagram page and even asked why I still have my post about my UMAT preparation. To give more context, Josh has also commented on my body on how I haven't reached my full potential multiple times, at its worst he would mention it at least once a day. I have set boundaries with him, explaining that I understand where he's coming from and that I agree that I'm not in the best shape that I can be.

He texted me a couple times asking when I'm free, but I just brushed it off and have been in no contact since.I understand to an extent on where he's coming from as my ex is still following me on socials. I get that he might be trying to tell me things from a different perspective, and how my increased postings could seem desperate to my ex.

	"title" : "AITA for telling my friend that he was a jerk for not wanting to hang out with someone?",
	"body" : "I (23m) have been friends with the same group of people all my life. There's five of us, and we met in elementary school and have been extremely close ever since.One of these friends is a girl we'll call Melanie. Melanie is the only girl in the group, however that's never really been a big deal. None of us have ever seen her as different, and so we grew up with her going to sleepovers with us and basically doing all the same stuff we did with each other. Well, recently our friend, who we'll call Dan, got a girlfriend. I didn't originally have a problem with her her, until last week. My friends and I had made plans to go over to one of our houses to hang out, but when we got there, I and the other two noticed very quickly Melanie wasn't there. I ended up mentioning this to Dan, and he said he told her she shouldn't come. I was confused, since Dan and Melanie were just as close as the rest of us.He explained that his girlfriend didn't like Melanie because she only had male friends, and apparently that was a sign of a hoe. (Melanie is the farthest thing from a \"hoe\") He said that since his girlfriend didn't like her and didn't want them to be friends, he had stopped talking to Melanie. I was obviously upset by this, and told him that it was kind of messed up to just ditch one of his best friends of 17 years because of someone he met 3 months ago. He got defensive and said his girlfriend was just jealous that Melanie and him were close, but I told him that there was nothing different about our friendship with Melanie then our friendship with each other.We argued like this for a little until I gave up at trying to make him realize that he was being a jerk, and just left. The next day I woke up to a ton of texts and calls from him, and even some from his girlfriend. The texts we're sort of rude, with his girlfriends being much nastier. Just them telling me I'm jealous of their relationship, and that I'm trying to break them up.I just don't understand what made him go from not caring Melanie was a girl, to suddenly only seeing her as a girl and not one of his best friends.

We ended up separating and our daughter and I moved out of state. He agreed to this because he was planing on going into the Air-force and we both were working on ourselves to better a future relationship. Now that future relationships isn’t happening. Turns out he lied to me about wanting to go into the military, lied about that fact he stopped drinking and smoking and he lost interest in being a father. My daughter and I have been living out of state for a year now and he’s come to see her once for a week period. So the entire time she’s been three, he’s seen her for seven days. For the first seven months I would call every time our daughter asked and be started getting angry saying “you’re calling too much” so I stopped and started only calling for nap time and bed time. However that didn’t make him happy either. So I told him I tried but it’s not my responsibility to make you talk to her and if he wants to talk to her he can call. I still text him “nap” and “bed” and if he wants to talk to her, he’ll call. He refused to work all of 2023 except for Uber 2-3 days a week for 2-3 hours. While I found little jobs short term and have been trying really hard to find a good job. Two days ago him and I had a conversation about taxes. He wants to file and put our daughter on it to get the child tax credit. But because he is going to be owing taxes this year, he wouldn’t get the child, it will go to what he owes. I asked him to not put her on there so I can file and get the child tax credit since I have the child and he became enraged. He still wants to us it to go to what he owes the IRS rather then it going to things for our daughter. So would I be the AH if I filed for full custody making it where he can’t put her on there?Edit: our daughter is almost four but is the average height of a six year old. I am constantly having to buy new shoes, underwear, shirts and pants. She is also a really observant child and knows he doesn’t really want to show up or talk to her ( she knows cause he has said while knowing he’s on speaker and he can hear her). I want to do what’s best for my daughter. I want him to see her again but only when he actually wants to.

We have made the decision to spend the rest of our lives together and we spend hours talking about how our lives are going to look like in the future. We usually talk about our finances, housing situation and things that go along after marriage. We have started investing together as well in some SIPs.He is doing well for himself and loves to buy things for himself and those around him. He goes on shopping sprees and spend a good chunk of money, which sometimes I find too much. I have pointed this out to him, and he says it’s okay for me to tell him to stop when he is spending too much on things he doesn’t need.However, one thing that I particularly don’t like is when he spends on other people without thinking. A little background on his family: He has 2 sisters, one of them is married and her husband is well off who does better than my husband. The other sister is unmarried but she has a good job and does well for herself as well.My partner spends on expensive gifts like designer bags, clothes, latest tech gadgets and gives them to his sisters on multiple occasions every 3rd month. Every time they go out (my partner, his sisters and the brother in law) it’s my partner who picks up the tab every time. (I am not sure how adamant they are to pay the bill, but I know that my partner thinks it’s his responsibility to pay). He has even given the unmarried sister his credit card so she can order whatever she can, whenever she wants. The married sister gets these gifts on every occasion. Recently he bought her a very expensive phone on her birthday.In our culture, it’s important for the brother to give gifts and money to the married sister on festivals, birthdays etc but I believe he tends to overboard. I don’t mind the gifts, but I believe that it sets out back financially every time he goes overboard.A little background on me: I have a great job that I enjoy and to get married to him I would have to leave my job and move to a small city with no job prospects, whatsoever. He is doing well for himself and he works really hard but I believe that we need to seriously start saving up for ourselves and our future and spending all that money elsewhere will only set us back in our financial goals.I have tried talking to him but he says  that it’s his responsibility to take care of his sisters and everyone in the family to the best of his abilities. He thinks it is not a big deal but to me it is. I have stopped bringing this up because I don’t want him to think I have an issue with him spending on his sisters but it still bothers me every time.Am I wrong in any way?",

Parking in lots near my building so I have a short walk, but also not associated with my building would be the safest option, which is what I have been doing.I have lived in this condo complex for over 5 years.

The driver of this car (M70s) was still in his vehicle, and as I was pulling in got out of his car. I rolled down my window and politely asked him if he could move his car so it was not over the line.He immediately started screaming at me saying that he will not be moving his car because he doesn't want to park it too close to the curb, that he needs to unload his car, this is his assigned spot, that I am a bitch for asking him to move his car. He then continued to scream at me saying how he told the HOA and management company I have been parking here, and how I am not allowed to park here and I need to park closer to my building, and he has written many complaints about me because I am being \"an entitled bitch\" by parking next to his car which is why he \"has to park over the line\" so that I \"learn where I should be\" parking my car.I drove to a different spot in a different section from the lot, which is further from my building and parked there. I had to walked past his car to get to my building. When I walked past he was still screaming at me. I did not engage. I took pictures of his car clearly over the line, emailed the management company that handles common areas maintenance and disputes for our complex, and informed of this interaction.So I just wanted to check, AITA?",

We ended up becoming close friends, and over the years we would have trips, bail each other out of difficult life/health situations, and ultimately become quite tight.Unfortunately, they moved to a different region in my country. I kept in touch with them over the years and continued to visit and stay with them when I needed a getaway, on their offer.A little over two months ago, I had an opportunity with funds, scheduling, and training to attend a footrace in their region. I reached out to Bill, letting him know I'd be around. Bill mentions he has important functions that weekend with others to host, and will be unable to host me. No issue, I already booked a hotel because I wasn't already invited like that.So. The big weekend comes, I fly, pick up my rental and get to the hotel. \"I've made it to [City] safely!\" Crickets. NBD, I knew they had other things on their agenda. Three days pass. \"What's with this weather here? Just finished that marathon!\" Bill responded, \"you brought the cold weather with you. Lol.\" That's our typical joke. I asked Bill, \"how was your weekend?\" Crickets.The following night, I went to a restaurant I'd enjoyed when I stayed with them prior. It was about 1km from their house. I shoot a message, \"Closer to your neck of the woods, I’m hoping to hit up [Restaurant] if they’re open tonight. waving hello\" Still, no response.Two nights after the restaurant message – I tell Bill I had fun in their city and while we couldn't meet up, I hope the weekend was good to them too [with their events and guest].Today Bill messages me, \"we’re kind of floored that you could be less than a mile from my house and you didn’t even make an effort to stop by for five minutes.\" ... ”If they are a friend they are a priority.\" - I take this to mean they would have made time for me, yet – \"we would’ve expected that you would’ve said hey I’m a mile from your house.\" Bill went on to say that Frank was upset too, yet I cannot say for certain that Frank knows anything other than what Bill told him. My last message to him today read, \"my message history shows no response to my text [from that night].”I was able to make connections with other friends when in this region during this trip. Neither Bill nor Frank reached out to me that weekend to ask how the race was or how I was, I figured they were rather tight in scheduling, hence the ghosting. Now I feel upset that I upset him, and I've been beating myself up for it. Should I have just stopped by unannounced like that? I feel that would've been rude.Reddit. AITA for neither reaching out more nor appearing at their house after making such a long journey, even though the intent wasn't expressly to see them?Edit for clarity: Bill and Frank are married, though I largely communicate with Bill. Rarely call. Edit 2 for clarity: There was a 1 hour difference between my heads up and going to the restaurant, and over 24 hours since the previous unacknowledged \"how was your weekend\" message. Edit 3 for clarity: Bill's \"kind of floored comment\" came after he saw a post of me at the restaurant, which published after having left there.",

She is disabled and cannot work. so I have always had sympathy for her.When I started dating her son she wanted to spend a lot of time with me which I didn't see issue with as I already knew her. This was a mistake.No amount of time spent with her was enough. She felt entitled to every ounce of free time I had. She needed me to do everything with her and would guilt trip me even if I had work or plans with friends. She would manipulate me by planning a dinner without me knowing or set up the patio with drinks and snacks so if I dropped by, I would feel bad if I couldn't stay long.  Anytime I was over there with my bf she would try to be apart of all our time together and would linger where we were and stare at us until we invited her into the convo.Boundaries needed to be set with her. She did not take it well. My bf let her know that she was asking for way too much.She started acting out in some dramatic ways. She would stomp around the house when I was over, started saying I couldn't spend the night because me and my bf aren't married, told us she felt excluded, like we were avoiding her by spending time in his room. We tried facilitating this by watching movies in the living room, that of which she interrupted constantly by talking or making as much noise in the kitchen as possible- slamming cupboards, turning on the garbage disposal for minutes at a time, rustling through plastic bags, and other attention seeking behaviors. What made me lose all respect was when she started protesting against my boyfriend taking me on dates by telling him not to spend his money or waste gas.Her behavior after having simple boundaries set made me really dislike her and see how manipulative she is. I've been told to attribute this selfish mindset to her disease so it makes me feel ableist to dislike her for that reason. She suffocated all chances of me wanting to have any kind of relationship with her which she protested by saying that it would be very hard on her son, which might be true considering the living situation. My boyfriend is protective of me and advocates for me, and just ignores her deterrents.She's made it clear that If I don't want to be her best friend, that she'll make the environment hostile.AITAH for not wanting to have a close relationship with her?

She didn't respond well to this and told me that if I really loved my niece I would do anything I could to protect her. I was getting frustrated at this point at told her that I love my cats more and am not going to stress them out so I can meet my niece for a weekend.She hung up on me and is not responding to my calls, she got our mother involved and she's taken my sister's side and said I went too far and how could I love my cats more than my own niece. I admit that I could have responded better or kinder I just was frustrated that she wasn't even trying to find a middle ground where we could both be happy.",

I put the word marriage in quotes because I found out after the fact that there was actually no legal marriage that happened, as his girlfriend apparently didn't believe in legal marriage. They instead had a ?symbolic? marriage to celebrate their commitment to eachother after being together for almost 4 years, but the guests were led to believe that it was a legal marriage. He and his now ex-girlfriend had asked for donations for their honeymoon in lieu of wedding gifts. The 'wedding' happened, and then his girlfriend broke up with him before they even went on their honeymoon. Weeks have now passed, and they never returned any of the guests' donations for their honeymoon fund.  I don't want to rub salt in the wound, and I understand that once a gift is given, it is done; however, this is an unusual circumstance. Am I being an asshole  asking for the money gift back?Edit: Some answers to commenter questions: I donated 200$ as my wedding gift for their honeymoon fund. Yes, there was a wedding party and food was offered (nothing super fancy); though from what I was told, the wedding was paid for by their parents. Many guests, including myself, paid a lot of additional expenses to travel to their wedding to attend (hotel costs, time off of work, gas).",

	"body" : "I (25F) knew my ex-best friend (26F) since we were in the fourth grade together. We absolutely were best friends, basically sisters, but it has been 3 years since ending our friendship on difficult terms. I realized that she relied heavily on me for everything, and I would bend over backwards with whatever she wanted or needed. This not mutual as when I went through my own significantly difficult time in my life, she was not there for me and instead was condescending and treated me like it didn’t matter that I was going through difficulties, and that I just had to “get over it”. I was not in a place in my life to bend over backwards for her anymore and she did not attempt to even be there for me, let alone help me when I needed her most. At this time I just stopped talking with her and we drifted apart with hurt feelings but no real blowup.She reached out about a year after we had drifted apart, and I agreed to attempt to reconnect, only to realize again how selfish she was when a crisis came up while we were re-connecting, and she blew me off after I asked for a simple request from her. At this time, I then also told her I would love to remain her friend, but I could not be best friends with her anymore. She blew up at this and said if I wouldn’t be best friends, she didn’t want me in her life at all, so we stopped being friends. I also found out from another friend that she was saying untrue and mean things about me, such as calling me manipulative and saying I could not keep secrets, so my friend should “watch out for me”. So I know she was talking badly behind my back and telling lies, as well as twisting the story to make her out to be the victim.Fast forward three years, I am getting married! My mom (68F) has been going through a hard time, so she has been acting out and causing problems toward me. She got it in her head that she had to reconnect with my ex-best friend. The problem began when I started discussing the invitations to the wedding and my mom announced that as a matter of fact that, “ex-best friend is coming to the wedding” and in fact that she had already invited her. I told my mom absolutely not, and that she couldn’t give unofficial invites because I still had not finalized my guest list, which my mom did not take well. My mom said that I “actually want [my ex-best friend] there, [I] just don’t know it”. My mom also claimed because she is helping pay for the wedding, it’s actually my mom’s wedding and I need to just accept it. I am in charge of sending invitations and I am refusing to make one out for my ex-best friend, no matter what my mom says. My mom demands I just “need to forgive and forget”, but I do not want to have another attempt at being friends with her and I really do not want to invite her to my wedding.So, AITA for not allowing my mom to invite my ex-best friend to my wedding?",

	"title" : "AITA For Telling My Mom She Needs To Get Her Own Hotel Room?",
	"body" : "I am 22 and I took a huge step about six months ago and moved away from home to be with my partner (26). My parents (mom is 47, dad is 60) weren’t happy about it. They didn’t like it when I moved 35 miles away to go to a university, so now that I’m around 1,300 miles away, it’s a BIG deal for them and they call and text constantly. I’m genuinely shocked neither of them has tried to make me get Life360 or something, because they’re always asking where I am or what I’m doing and freaking out about every possible bad thing that could happen. It’s emotionally exhausting. Despite this, I do love my parents, and I try to maintain a good relationship with them.Ever since I moved, my mom has asked when she can come and visit. For those of you who have uprooted your life and moved hundreds of miles away, I’m sure you understand how stressful this is. I had to find a new job, get my new documents in order (license, insurance, etc), unpack my entire life, find a new routine, just a never ending list of tasks to get acclimated to this lovely new place.Anyway, she has finally settled on coming to visit in April, when she’ll be able to take leave from work for a bit. We started discussing activities and places to visit, and I told her which towns nearby would be the best places to get hotel rooms in, because I’m pretty sure that there’s nothing like that in my new town, as it’s so small. I told her if there were some vacancies in town, though, I’d keep an eye out and let her know. Things got awkward at this point, because she had apparently assumed she would stay with my partner and I in our apartment. I told that wouldn’t work, and when she asked why I provided all the reasons I could think of at the moment:If she gets a rental car, she can’t park in our driveway, there isn’t room.Overnight guests aren’t allowed in our lease.My partner and I want our privacy. This is our home, and we do not want to keep overnight guests.We don’t have the room to keep her. We have one bed and one bathroom.Her response to all of these was basically “BUT I’M YOUR MOTHER!” I told her I’m sorry, but we can’t host her overnight. She also has a habit of bringing her dog along with her when she says she won’t, and my partner and I aren’t allowed any pets in the apartment whatsoever. She’s angry with me and has since been accusing me of not loving or caring about her, that I’m ungrateful and selfish, and that I obviously don’t want to see her and just moved to get away from her. She also said that if we visited, someone would host us instead of making us get a room. I told her we would get a room anyway, because again, we prefer our privacy, and I’m pretty sure my relatives don’t want to host a queer couple anyways. My coming out last year had mixed reviews to say the least.After all of this, I’m wondering if I was really being an asshole here or if my mom is just unreasonable. AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for telling my roommate that she is neglecting her puppy",
	"body" : "Apologies for any formatting issues - I’m on my phone.My best friend and I (both 22F) started living together last year. We both work a full-time job (I work 40 hours, and she works between 45-55 hours a week).Roommate wanted a puppy (small female Maltipoo). I said that I was fine with her having a dog, but that I can’t put up with a yappy, untrained dog. She agreed.Things were going okay, but I would notice that the puppy would only get about a 5-10 minute walk in the morning at around 7:30AM, whenever my roommate could get home for lunch (between 11AM-2PM), and then maybe once or twice after she got home (5PM-7PM). Mostly short walks. When she’s gone she leaves a couple toys that the dog gets bored with quickly.The puppy generally played well with my indoor cat (boy), but there were a couple times where she was very hyper because she hadn’t been exercised, and she would grab him by his neck with vigor. This freaked me out, and I told my roommate that the dog should get longer than a 5 minute walk in the morning before work, because if she has a lot of energy she could accidentally hurt my cat.My roommate agreed and told me that she would walk her dog longer in the morning. She didn’t. She was also unwilling to put the dog in daycare, to hire a dogwalker, or to confine her dog in any way unless my cat was also confined some days.Now, the dog is 8 months old and not potty trained, not house trained, barely leash trained, not kennel trained, and not obedience trained (does not listen to any commands besides the occasional “sit”). She pees/poops in the house frequently, peed on the couch twice, barks constantly, and has destroyed some of my belongings. Roommate is not trying to train her, either.The other day, my roommate did not come home at lunch to take her dog out, and so the dog was inside from 7:30AM-5:15PM, and pooped inside. When she can’t take the dog out at lunch, I’ll usually take her out, but she didn’t tell me that she was going to be gone that day.To me, an untrained 8 month old puppy should not be left loose in the apartment for close to 10 hours without a potty break. So when it looked like it was going to happen again the next day, I said that leaving an 8 month old dog inside for 10 hours is getting neglectful. It’s also dangerous for my cat.My roommate was very hurt by this, and said that it is not neglectful. She said that we have different opinions of what neglect is, that her dogs growing up were left inside without a potty break for the whole workday, and that she has to train her dog the way that she sees fit. She is annoyed by how much I complain about the dog. She went to a mutual friend’s house and refused to talk to me.I feel bad for complaining so much and using harsh language, and almost wish I hadn’t said anything.AITA for saying that it’s neglectful behavior?",

There’s a certain supervisor that has always picked on me since I’ve been hired, but luckily we haven’t worked together for the past couple weeks because we’ve had different schedules—until tonight. He recently changed the cleaning process and it now takes twice the amount of time to clean.1st INCIDENT: I asked my supervisor why we’re doing it this way when it takes much longer and he responded by saying, “you’ve done enough already, you can wait outside”. Keep in mind this is after I had cleaned so it wasn’t like I was sitting around refusing to work and complaining. My coworkers agreed that I had asked my supervisor in a respectful tone and was very cordial when inquiring why we were using this new process. He continued to give me attitude and while I was walking away from the plane he yelled, “look at you, first day back and you’re acting like this!”, I kept walking because I didn’t want to escalate the conversation. I also haven’t been on vacation or missed any work so I don’t know what he’s talking about when saying it’s my first day back.2nd INCIDENT: Later that night in our official work groupchat we were asked to vote for an employee of the month. The supervisor that has been problematic votes for a guy named Brad (he is white, this will matter later on)…he then sends a text afterwards saying “The only white boy who works and doesn’t complain”. Clearly referring to me because I’m the only other white male that works in our department.QUESTION: I don’t want to work with him if he’s going to continue picking on me and throwing passive aggressive comments towards me. I don’t have isssues with any of the other coworkers, and they enjoy working with me— so I’ve made sure I’m not the delusional one here. What should I do? Should I try talking to HR? Are his comments in the work group chat acceptable for a supervisor?Any feedback is welcome, thank you.",

I won't use your food. she says okay and leaves. she later texts me saying that she'd really rather me not use her pans.

I apologize profusely for not cleaning her pan right. I agree I won't use her pots and pans. when I buy my own pot and pan, there's barely room in the cupboard for it, but I squeeze it in.about a week later, Anna texts me telling me not to stack my dishes on the drying mat on top of hers if I don't clean mine properly, because it could gunk up her stuff. by this point, I'm suspicious. I KNOW that I cleaned my dishes properly. I check after she texts me this, and they're just fine -- certainly not messy enough to drop gunk onto her dishes. I text her that I clean my dishes properly.the next day (today) she knocks on my door and shows me one of her bowls. there's a speck of dust on it, and she tells me its proof i dont clean my dishes right.

There were at least 30 people there as she a mix of childhood, college, work, and city friends like me that she's met since moving to nyc. I knew at least 2/3 of the guests and got along well with all of them. There was a $50 spending limit. I spent $51.23 but with our sales tax being almost 10% I went about $5 over the limit. I bought 3 unisex items, 2 of which were on super sale (30-50% off). Without the sale the total would have been around $80. I bought everything at target, it's not like any of the items were extravagant by any means although I got a lot of feedback that my gifts were creative and fun. Some people spent less than $50. For instance someone brought a lush bath set that I saw in store for $30. No issue with that at all just adding for context. I'd say most people spent right around $50.My gift was extremely popular. It was one of the first wrapped packages picked and before we made it through half the picks my gift had already been stolen the max amount of times and removed from rotation. I was super happy the final giftee was excited with the gift. Multiple people asked where I got the gifts and I told them on super sale at target. After the party I left for the holiday then a long vacation with my husband. I returned recently and heard through the grapevine a couple people were annoyed with my gift. Apparently they feel the $50 cap applies to the value of the gift not the sticker price and feel that i intentionally tried to upstage them. Hand to God I didn't, I thought if I spent $50 I was within the rules. For what its worth the 2 ladies annoyed with me are people I did not know prior to that night, and after apologizing to the hostess she reassured me i did nothing wrong and she loved what i brought. No one I know was upset with my gift either. But now I am questioning myself if I was an asshole for buying gifts that were worth more than $50? I'm not a showboat person by any means and feel bad that my gifts may have made others feel bad about their gifts.",

	"body" : "I (18m) am saving up for a holiday to italy in July. The original plan was to take my sister (13) but since she's too young my parents didn't want me to go alone with her in case something happened to one of us. Fair enough. So I asked my dad to come with me instead, it's not a case of choosing my dad over my mum, me and my mum work in the same place and we wouldn't be able to get the same week off. I also can't afford to take 4 of us. My parents are really struggling financially atm so they can't really put anything toward it.It's also not really possible because there is only one week in the year that all 4 of us are off and it's a week in August. That week is totally booked everywhere. So even if I could afford to take my mum and sister too (my sister would cause us a fine for taking her out during school time on top of that) we can't even get the same week off anyway. So essentially I'm now being guilt tripped for not either, changing my destination to somewhere I don't really want to go/can't afford and going August, or not waiting until next August.I don't think it's fair that I'm being expected to only go away when we all can. I totally understand that it's disappointing for whoever doesn't get to go, but that isn't something that I can do anything about. Am I being unreasonable?",

We stopped hanging out as often but whenever we do, he always brings him around, he used to ask if he could but now just does it which is very annoying, i also get annoyed that he just invites himself to our things but has never invited us to anything (including birthdays) so that adds to it but me and our other friends dont say anything because we dont want any drama, i know its kinda wrong for me not to say it makes me uncomfortable, but i know he would just get mad and last time i did say i didnt like a friends boyfriend who was also abusive she just ended the friendship, i dont have a large friend group so would just rather avoid the confrontation.

She saw me through the cameras and saw that I didn't even come the first day and the second day, I just walked around her garden doing nothing. I apologized and explained to her about the rain, and said there's no point on watering if it's raining all day and night. Isn't that too much water?

Fast forward to now, me and my partner had a rocky patch between asking them to be bridesmaids and now, he vented to his sisters about me and its now created an argument because he was talking to his older sisters on facetime and my partner couldn't answer one of the wedding related questions (guest count and who's invited) because he's quite forgetful when it comes to the wedding, so I answered. This seemed to anger his older sister as she thought I was butting in,  little sister then also stated that when they are talking to there brother on facetime then they are talking to just him, not both of us,  this is when were sat next to each other for context. Alongside the fact that she wants us to invite her husbands family to the daytime, at this point we are already at capacity for the amount of guests that we have invited, but my fiancée stated that he would invite some of them to the day if people who are currently invited say no. We were hoping to reduce the guest list a little bit to save some money as jts roughly £110 per person for the day and if we could save some money that would be great as Weddings are super expensive. His sister still seemed to be annoyed about this fact as she states that there his family too now, which I get but my fiancée should be able to choose who he wants to be invited and not feel pressured into inviting people, I think.

During the summer break, our year advisor sent us the camp groups and I was in a group with 4 friends in my friend circle, plus a new student named Vivien. It turns out there were 5 students transferring to my school.The year advisor then asked for volunteers to help the transfer students settle into the school. I was excited by this. I thought this would be an opportunity to socialise. Plus, since we had Vivien in my cabin group, I thought being a buddy to her meant a less awkward experience for Vivien as she's not going to be feel as if she's sleeping with complete strangers at camp.I told my friend group on our gc that the camp groups were released.  One of my friends asked who Vivien was and I told her that she was a new student. Our group has 10 people and the maximum number of people in a single cabin is 8. So we split up 5-5. Our cabin group got Vivien so we got 6 people in total and the other group was a group of 7 because two other friends from a different friend group joined.The issue was when I volunteered to be a buddy without telling my friend group. At first, I thought I didn't need to. I thought that since Vivien was going to be in my cabin anyway, it didn't matter if she hung out with us for a bit.However, one of my friends, Angela, got really mad at me for not telling her beforehand that Vivien is hanging out with the friendgroup for at least the first few weeks because I signed up to be a buddy. As everyone in this group has known each other since year 7, it's going to change the group dynamic as this person was not someone anyone knew online or irl. We had two transfer students last year but one of them I knew since 4th grade and the other one went to the same primary school as some of my friends so it was a lot less awkward.The friendgroup is taking sides. Some of my friends took Angela's side, saying that our group is very tight knit and that I should've known that some of our friendgroup don't like socialising with others outside of the circle. Some of my friends are on my side, saying that it's not that big of a deal. They said it was considerate of me to sign up and to give Vivien some familiarity before school camp begins.The fact I just jumped in to volunteer straight away without telling my friends beforehand is the reason why I might be viewed as an asshole. Camp goes on for a week and because I'm a buddy, Vivien might be with us for at least a few weeks after camp. Plus, I knew some of them would be uncomfortable with this decision but I jumped in anyway.AITA for wanting to socialise with a new student without telling my friendgroup beforehand?",

	"body" : "My sisters, my mom and I were on a weekend vacation. I did a lot of research finding a good spot to eat outside coming out of a cold stretch. My sisters said they were perfectly happy reading by the pool all day. I didn’t force anyone to join me but they joined anyways. We had already spent hours at the pool. Everyone heard me talking about sitting outside and having a really good lunch for two days. The day before we ate indoors already and it was fine but the atmosphere was not ideal.So day 3 I finally pick a spot and when we get there my sister gets to the hostess first. The wait was going to be 45 minutes but my sisters wanted to wait since the food looked good. I guess when the hostess asked “inside or outside?” my younger sister said, “doesn’t matter.” My mom (who told me this later) said, “Jenny wants to sit outside.” I guess my sister shrugged it off.One of my sisters is in brace sitting down as we wait. She has broken her bones, multiple breaks, on uncountable occasions. She is a mountain biker/adventure seeker. This is par the course for her.So I am still unaware that we are waiting for an indoor or outdoor table. I go over to a shop next door since this will be my only opportunity to walk around, since my sister can’t walk around with her brace on. I am over there for 15 minutes and out table is already ready. And when I get there, we are sitting inside at a corner table. The only seat left is facing the corner walls. My sisters have sat at the only seats facing windows and the other nice seat is being used for my sisters legs. Granted she could have used a chair but I didn’t go there. She makes a comment about how she hates having her back to people (yeah don’t we all) I put my stuff down, comment how loud it is, and go to the bathroom. When I come out, I asked if I can sit next to them on the booth and I’ll sit in my seat with the food comes out. Well this results in my younger sister getting up and yelling at me, telling me how selfish I am.My older sister  asks, “how does your husband deal with you?” And another comment how high maintenance I am.  I say, “well he would have wanted to sit outside too.”  I defend myself saying I’m not high maintenance.” Then everyone is laughing at me saying how high maintenance I am. Aquote from my sister, “who is in your life that makes you feel like you are not high maintenance?”I was told later that it was selfish to even ask if the wait would have been longer to sit outside. My sister’s comfort was more important even though she was sitting while waiting. They never even asked how much longer also. Could have been five minutes. And our table was ready way before we even thought. But everyone jumped down my throat when I was disappointed. Which lead to my being actually upset for being yelled and laughed at and basically being told I am the problem.I spent a lot of time picking the restaurant but lost my appetite and just a had soup.",

It was the classic \"Hey watch my pet for a while\" thing that usually leaves people with animals they didn't intend to have but love anyways. We were those people. Our rabbit is the  best, for this post I will call her Ivy. She is the sweetest little bun in the world.When we were first asked to watch her she lived in my room. She had plenty of space to run during her out time, plenty of cardboard and wood pieces to chew on, and because I am in my room all the time I became her little buddy and main caretaker.My mom has always wanted a rabbit and was super excited to have Ivy in our house, especially when we realized she was basically ours.One day my mom came up with the brilliant idea to move Ivy into our guest room. I was fine with it in theory, but in reality I knew it was going to be miserable. The guest room was basically my moms walk in closet. It is directly across from my parents room and is filled with makeup and clothes all belonging to my mom.My mom is also a huge procrastinator. Everytime she tells us she is going to do something, it never happens, or it happens the day off. She told me that we would move Ivy in before my big birthday party so I could clean up my room. We did it the day of.Now Ivy is in a small room still filled with clothes and makeup. Everytime I go in there she is missing something important, even though my mother constantly is in and out of that room and should have noticed. Ivy barely gets to socialize which is very crucial for rabbits, especially young ones like her.So, I'm planning on giving my mom an ultimatum. I cleared out a space in my room that is both healthy for Ivy and for me. I have feeding, play, and cleaning times marked down and posted on the wall. I have everything set up.I want to tell my mom that if she does not clean up the guest room by a certain date then Ivy will no longer be OUR bunny, she will be mine. I will solely take care of her and my mom cannot get her dream pet.I've discussed this with a few friends and my therapist. My therapist is on board, but some of my friends have made me doubt that this is the right thing to do and have said I'm being an asshole.So reddit, would I be the asshole for giving my mom an ultimatum?Edit: My parents have been neglectful most of my life. They give me bare minimum when it comes to care, that is why a discussion will not work. I have tried having one about my own care in the past and it is met with empty promises.

After being in an accident, I was unable to work, trying to complete an honors degree and living with my then abusive boyfriend.I had rekindled things with this ex (but solely as a friend). I always liked this ex as a person, just not as a partner. I thought they were great, we always had great conversations, and I thought he was a stand-up, honest guy.After a few months of talking, I told him about my situation with my ex, and he suggested that I come live with him, but that he understood that I did not want a relationship. He is well off with multiple jobs and a 4 bedroom house with just him and his dogs. I hesitated as I have always found it really hard accepting help from others, but my situation at home was getting out of hand and it was one of those situations where 'I either get out now or I'll be stuck in this cycle for life' so I made a super rash decision, packed up my life in 4 hours and moved in with him.Things were going well. He offered to help me with most of my living expenses, including therapy, groceries, gas, and the odd outing. I tried to decline, but he insisted, giving me his card and telling me how it makes him happy to help me and to just help people in general and he would never expect anything in return (at the time he was helping quite a few people here and there).It's been about 4 months now, and things have changed dramatically.I don't even know who he is anymore, he is accusing me of using him, he told me I can't do washing at the house anymore, he changed all the WiFi passwords and he told me he wants me out by the end of the month (aka 10 day) because he wants me out of his life. He has pretty much cut all his friends out of his life as he says they all use him, he has lost 2 of his 3 jobs and all he does is smoke weed 24/7.Beginning of December he was upset with me because I wasn't a good enough friend, I wasn't making effort in our friendship and since then it just feels like he is looking for anything to fight about. I feel like I haven't actually done anything wrong besides actually accepting his financial help and living with him... I have since just gotten a job again (haven't even received my first paycheck) and he told me I could settle in first (this was end December) and now he is telling me he wants me out. He has been contradicting a lot of the things he has previously said and it just makes me wonder if anything he has ever said is true ? Because about 2 weeks ago during a conversation he said that when he offers to help friends out its just a test to see how much they will take and that he actually plays 'strategy games with all his 'friends'. He has no friends anymore, which he says is because they all just took from him, which I solidly believed up until now.... AITA for accepting his help ?",

I’m in desperate need of outside opinion.I (24f) posted a picture of my roommates (25f) hoodie this morning to my Snapchat story. I don’t have a lot of friends on there aside from her. If I post something on there it usually gets like max 15 views or something. The hoodie in question had a phrase from an anime she used to like a lot, but not anymore. I took the picture of her back while she was wearing it (the part that displayed the phrase) and I captioned it “everyday I wake up”. I didn’t really think much of it other than that I thought it was funny and moved on. Well maybe 10-15 minutes later while I was brushing my teeth she storms into the bathroom and takes a picture of my face mid brush (toothpaste all over, drooling - I just got an oral b toothbrush and I’m sorta messy) and posts it to her story. Mouth still occupied, I’m like “yo what is happening” - garbled but understandable. She then starts screaming about how frustrating I am, and how I didn’t ask her to post it. She’s shaking mad, yelling at the top of her lungs. I finish brushing my teeth and come back into the living room with her. “I just don’t want to be judged in my own house, you always frustrate me so much!” She says. “I didn’t post a picture of your face, no one has even seen it yet” (aside from like, my mom maybe) I say “You didn’t even ask me! You know this is all I have! (Clothing wise)” She bites back, but we both did laundry together two days ago, and her pants are themed with the same anime so it seems like a choice to me. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings. I’ll delete it right now” I say, and delete the picture. It has been up for maybe 20 minutes at this point. “It doesn’t even matter, you should t have done it in the first place! I don’t know why I’m even trying right now “ she says some other stuff along these lines, I can’t remember exactly. She stomps into her room and slams the door. She works from home and I have an on-site job- so I leave for work.First of all, I totally understand where she’s coming from about not wanting a picture of yourself posted. Even if it’s something not clear, it’s your visage. That’s why I immediately deleted it and apologized. The problem comes from her response. She responded with screaming and yelling, taking a full picture of my face in a compromising situation (which is much worse than an anonymous back picture imo) and demeaning me. If I were her, I feel I would’ve just asked her to delete the picture, not resort to theatrics. But I’m not her, and if I truly hurt her that badly I want to make it up to her. She’s my best friend right now. In the past with my other friends, it was normal to post funny pictures of one another on our stories. I’m confused. What gives? AITA?",

I don’t ask for or expect much but an example is when I asked for a $14 mushroom Squishmallow and he got me a Minnie Mouse one he found locally. He always finds something so he doesn’t have to buy online and ultimately gets stuff that only slightly relates to what others have asked for even though he could easily afford ordering items.Today he had a bad day at work so I asked him to make a list for an Amazon and send me the link so I can surprise him with a gift. I always buy stuff online for him, especially links he has sent me before.

Then he just blows up on me saying that if he doesn’t want to do it he doesn’t have to because that was the way he was raised and I’m being manipulative.

	"body" : "I was on the way back from work today feeling kinda exhausted from a long day. Usually I shower at night but since I’m sort of tired I decided to shower tomorrow morning. I also usually record music (I make beats) but once again I’m kinda tired so I decided maybe just relax completely for this evening. When I got in my girlfriend said she was going to cook up some vegetables that were about to expire. I said I was not so sure that I want it because I was filled up from a large Chipotle lunch that I had earlier today also a lot of the vegetables were brussel sprouts which I’m not a huge fan of. She asked if I could at least try some and I said okay. She gets overwhelmed from cooking so she asked that I do her laundry for her in exchange for her cooking food for us. I agreed. When I came upstairs she was crying and saying it was not going well. Then she blamed me because I wasn’t appreciative of her cooking for us. I said that I really just wasn’t hungry but I agreed to try some anyway. Then she asked what I was going to do while she cooked and I said I didn’t know and that I would probably take a shower tomorrow and not work on my music tonight because I’m feeling a little burnt out. She said I should of let her know my “plans” ahead of time because if she knew about this she probably wouldn’t have cooked and just relaxed with me. I asked her “so while I was driving back from work and  I had the thought to relax this evening I should have texted her to let her know?” She said “No. You should have told me when you walked in the apartment then we could have gotten doordash or something. Keep in mind the past few times I brought up Doordash this has also stressed her because she gets anxiety about spending money (I’m usually the one who pays for Doordash anyway). I just don’t know what I could have done to prevent this and she always has me feeling like I did something wrong.",

	"body" : "So my sister, (19 f) asked if she could buy and install lethal company on my gaming laptop and play it. Of course, I said yes, because quite frankly I don’t mind. But it’s gotten to the point where she uses it just about every second of every day. I’m worried about her running down the GPU and essentially burning it out from using it so much. It’s at the point I have to ask for my laptop back if I want to use it. so, AITA if I ask her to not use it so much?",

	"title" : "AITA for walking away from my mother without saying anything?",
	"body" : "I (f23) and my mother (f46) have a very unsteady relationship. When it’s good it’s very good and when it’s bad it’s very bad. When we are on good terms we spend almost all of our time together even if we don’t talk about anything or do anything in particular. My mother has come into the habit of speaking over or outright ignoring me recently. Nothing has happened to trigger this, she has always sort have done it but never this much.I will try asking her a question or telling her something and she will speak over me about something that popped in her head or tell me to wait until she’s done watching/reading/doing something and proceed to go minutes without saying anything and never ask me what I was going to say again. If not that, I will say something and not get any sort of signal or reply, wait a few moments and ask her if she heard me and she will say yes and never reply to me or acknowledge what I said.It gets very frustrating because I try to make a point of being attentive and listening to what people have to say and making sure they know I’m listening, because there is nothing that personally frustrates me more than being ignored. We were in her room earlier and I was searching through movies to watch and I started to tell her about my opinion on something related to one of the movies I saw, but she interrupted to laugh at something she saw on her phone and said “sorry one minute” and continued to watch for the next few minutes without acknowledging me. After I realized she wouldn’t reply I just left her room and went into my own.about a half hour later she came looking for me and Asked why I left. I didn’t reply and she asked if it was because she didn’t reply to me earlier. which frustrated me because that means she knew she ignored me. I said it was but it wasn’t as though I was stomping away after being ignored once, and it happens all of the time now. The reason I didn’t tell her that it frustrates me instead of leaving is because she gets angry at anything that sounds like criticism of her. And of course, she got angry and said she never ignores me and she said sorry when she was watching the video, and that I catch an attitude like a brat when I don’t get a reply the moment I want one. And she slammed the door and left. Was I being a brat here? AITA?TLDR; mother ignored me so I walked away from her and now she’s angry at me.",

	"title" : "AITA for not being enthusiastic about a gift",
	"body" : "AITA for this not enthusiastic about receiving a plant and stuffed bear from my partner? 2 weeks ago I attempted to break up with my partner. Over the last year we had a rough go of it. I realized most of our time was based on their time and I wasn’t being considered a lot of the time. Many times my wants and needs were put to the side for their sake. After trying couples therapy and individual therapy I started disconnecting still. I waiting for change and some changes were made but I was still feeling like what I wanted and needed did not matter. So after time I started choosing myself and I couldn’t shake the feeling of losing feelings towards my partner. I attempted to break up with them twice and we’ve discussed it more after that. We recently went to their therapist office and not mine where we originally started. It felt like they were trying very hard to convince me to give it another shot. I explained how it would be like all the other times and how it feels like if I do this then I’m once again putting my wants and needs aside for my partners sake. Any ways today I come home to a plant and bear on the table. My partner asks me if I notice anything different and I say yes and continue on with getting ready for my gym session after work. They didn’t take my response well..  they were definitely saddened that I was not enthusiastic about this gift. Not that I don’t appreciate it but how am I supposed to feel after the last few weeks we’ve had? So am I the a** h***? This feels like a last ditch effort. This would have been nice to receive during good times and not where we are now.",

	"title" : "AITA for telling my mom she’s not my top priority rn?",
	"body" : "so i (17f) got in an argument today w my mom (47f) she thinks we have a great bond while i dislike the way she acts towards me and try to back off. she was complaining abt the fact that she thinks that she’s “working for us” (me and my brother -13m-) while we don’t spend any time w her. we ofc help at home with the chores, so it wasn’t the fact that she’s always cleaning, doing the laundry… etc while we do nothing. so she told me this: “you say that you’re always studying but then you go out with your friends and you never do anything with me” (and a lot more complaints, my mom’s a self compassionate bitch). and tbh i just feel like i’m doing my job bcs:i study and get the best grades in my classi go out with my friends when i don’t have to studywhenever im feeling socially overwhelmed i have my own hobbies and play the videogames i like. so she replied: “so to you i’m like the last of your shitty priorities?” and i was like “no, ofc not, but you know well enough that my top priority is studying”. and i went on by saying “you’re always complaining about whatever i do. if it’s studying its bcs i study too much, if i hang out with my friends its bcs im out and not paying attention to you, if i stay home playing videogames i’m just an addicted piece of shit. she told me to stop exaggerating and to go fuck myself. imo, i feel im not her top priority either so she’s very hypocritical: she’s always working, if she isn’t at work she’s with her boyfriend or with her friends and she travels a lot. and whenever she’s at home she’s always in a shitty mood telling off both my brother and i. so aita for reacting like this??",

	"title" : "AITA for overreacting to parenting criticism",
	"body" : "I (33f) and my partner (39m) have a five month old baby. We've been together for almost a decade, married for three.Background on me: I was raised in a mildly abusive household, and I've dealt with depression for as long as I can remember. I was diagnosed with CPTSD, Bipolar II, and ADHD in my late twenties. I've been medicated for all these things for about four or five years, with no major issues.Background on him: normal dude.Despite the absolutely indescribable happiness that my daughter gives me, I have experienced an increase in depression and anxiety. I'm terrified of being a bad or neglectful mother, and I've confided in this to my partner. I don't feel like my daughter and I have developed a solid bond, and I've told him that I'm scared that people are judging my parenting skills and that she cries more when she's with me. When prompted to, he reassures me this isn't the case.The other day, on a good day, completely out of the blue (at least to me) my partner told me that I seemed overwhelmed by our daughter and asked if my BP or ADHD were contributing towards my lack of attention* of her, by making me delay my reaction to her crying. I tend to think too long about what might be making her cry rather than simply trying to stop the crying. He confirmed that she does cry more with me and said I don't do enough to try to keep her distracted. Sometimes I feed her her bottle with one hand and I am on my phone with the other and that makes him uncomfortable because I'm not giving her my full attention.He later said it was uncalled for and is acting like everything is normal again, but I just can't, and I can tell my distance from him is bothering him. I can't make myself be even just affectionately physical with him, and it's hard to be in the same room with him.But is it uncalled for? Am I overreacting? He really didn't say anything I hadn't felt or said before. AITA for giving him the cold shoulder and clinging to how I feel about that moment when he said those things, when it is all plausibly valid criticism?*edited for poor word choice",
