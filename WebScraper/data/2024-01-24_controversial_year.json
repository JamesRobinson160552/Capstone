	"title" : "AITA for wearing a different colored bridesmaid dress after the bride tried to purposely make us look unflattering?",
	"body" : "Hi, for privacy reasons this post will be a throwaway, and all names are fake.Recently, I (28F) was a bridesmaid in my friend Tara (28F) and Tony's (30M) wedding, along with bridesmaids Amy (27F), Jane (29F) and her sister Lily (32F).Tara was one of those brides where everything had to be perfect, so early on, Tara placed her priority on the logistics. Because of this, Tara had left the details about the bridesmaid dresses for last.Tara had organized a lunch for us in April to talk over the details of the dresses. She handed out swatches and said that the dresses must be in that color and floor length. I asked Tara if she was being serious to which Tara asked what the problem was. Simply put, the color was ugly and unflattering. Jane also spoke up and said that this color is going to make everyone in the party look bad. Amy also agreed. Tara rolled her eyes at us and said that she was sure and she expected us as bridesmaids to go along with what she wanted. Lily decided to chime and say that she thought the color was fine. I think that she said this to prevent her younger sister from going full bridezilla.For months, Amy, Jane and I BEGGED Tara to consider a different color, but she wouldn't budge. We asked Lily to ask her sister to reconsider, but she said that she was the bride, and that we should \"respect her choices.\" Yeah, no shit she was the bride, but that doesn't mean that we have to sacrifice the way we look, and look unattractive. Amy pointed out that Tara was probably making us look bad on purpose, so that she could look better, and that made me furious.And here's where I may be in the wrong. Amy, Jane and I decided that enough was enough and that Tara was being really unreasonable about this whole thing, and so was Lily. So we decided to lie to Tara and say that we were going to order dresses in the color she wanted and sent her screenshots of dresses in that color. Meanwhile, the three of us created a separate group chat and decided to order dresses that would actually make us look good. We agreed on baby blue and bought the dresses online. Tara didn't ask any more questions about the dresses and essentially just took our word that everything was okay.Flash forward to wedding day. The moment we put on our dresses, Tara lost her shit. She started yelling at us and crying, and Lily had to escort her out of the room. Apparently she must have gotten ready elsewhere, because we didn't see her up until we were called to go to the venue for the ceremony. The wedding was great, but Tara was upset.Since the wedding, none of us have heard from Tara. However, Lily and Tony have been texting me, calling us horrible people and claiming we ruined the wedding. Tony even said that Tara almost cancelled the whole thing, and he had to force her to go through with it. Maybe Tara was upset that we didn't get the color that she asked for, but I don't think it was right for her to make us look unattractive. AITA?",

I told her that I want her to come back sooner than later and that I don’t want her to go to the cabin. She says I’m welcome to come with her but she wants to spend this time with her niece.I told her she’s going to come home within the next week or so and she snapped that I’m not her boss and that she will be taking her niece to see snow then she will be spending Christmas with her.Now we’re not speaking so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.",

	"title" : "AITA for pointing out my sister's blue hand?",
	"body" : "I (27M) have an older sister (34F). She is a professional chef, and she has a lot of culinary-themed tattoos. Recently she got her hands tattooed with measurements she uses a lot in the kitchen, like teaspoon and tablespoon and that sort of thing. She says she actually refers to them at work a lot, but I really think she just got them because it makes people ask her what they're about and then she gets to talk about being a chef. It impresses people and I know she enjoys the attention.Recently, we were having dinner with our parents and some family friends. The conversation turned to tattoos, and of course my sister started talking about her new ones. Since they're food-related, that steered the conversation away from tattoos and onto cooking and recipes. I kept waiting for the conversation to go back to tattoos so that I could talk about my newest one, but it wasn't happening. Finally, I found an opportunity to point out the fact that one of my sister's tattoos is such poor quality it dyed a part of the skin around it blue. That happens if the artist presses too hard and it's permanent, which means it was a cheap tattoo.Everyone else looked really awkward, but my sister laughed for some reason and said something like \"yeah, I just have a blue hand now, oh well\", and that really bothered me. I have many tattoos myself, but all of mine are really meaningful and I take a lot of care to find good artists. She obviously doesn't take them seriously and just gets them on a whim, but since hers are mostly for attention, everyone wants to talk about hers instead.I told her she shouldn't be so casual about having a bad tattoo and that it looks like it was cheap. I told her I'm glad she likes it but it looks like she's been taking colloidal silver or something. My dad told me to let it go and my mom kept trying to change the subject, and finally my sister just said \"my tattoos are personal, it's okay if you don't like them\" and ignored me for the rest of the night. My mom thinks I should apologize and apparently the friends who were there thought I was out of line. Personally, I think I was just pointing out a fact, and I honestly want her to get better tattoos in the future for her own sake. AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for telling friends that my girlfriend (f33) writes fanfiction?",
	"body" : "My girlfriend, Sandra (f33) and I (m35) have been together for about a year now. We’re not living together (yet) but we’ve talked about this. We’re both working in respectable fields.The other day, I was out with some mates and after our night, I was slightly tipsy and I thought of surprising Sandra (of course, a fake name) as I have keys to her flat. When I got there, I noticed she was asleep on the couch and her laptop was on the coffee table. She hates sleep mode so she disabled it so her laptop was on, not even locked. She had a word document and it seemed she’s been working on it.I caught some words and couldn’t help myself, I started reading. I took the laptop to the kitchen to not wake her up. Turns out it was romantic fan fiction about one of her favourite tv series. Nothing steamy, just some silly, girly, romantic notions kind of bs. You know the ones teenage girls dream of and then realise no man actually behaves like that. It’s like “no Susan, I ain’t touching the small of your back because you’re cute, not catching those harassment allegations” if you know what I mean.I was curious and desired to spy a little bit to see if she’d written more and discovered her accounts on 2 platforms for fan fiction (had no idea those sites were that huge). Anyway, she’s written a lot of them. All cutesy, girly shit and some naughty stuff (again, unrealistic in my opinion).When she woke up in the morning, I confronted her about this and she was defensive and started going on about privacy and stuff. I told her to cut the crap and to admit that she feels dissatisfied about our relationship and that’s why she’s writing and I gave her a reality check and said her “soft” men she writes were unrealistic. She was really angry and kicked me out. I told her I’m not one of her characters and won’t tolerate her mood swings but she still kicked me out.Later that day we were meeting our friends for lunch. Sandra came but barely spoke to me. At some point, we were talking about something and I mentioned what Sandra writes, hoping that people will laugh and one guy did, the rest just ignored my news which kind of surprised me, I tried to continue the topic and understand why everyone’s seemed okay with the cringe but Sandra called me an asshole and went to the bathroom. My friend told me it would be best if I left but I didn’t want to do so because  didn’t do anything bad. When Sandra came back she told me her writing is her private thing and I’m an asshole for bringing it up. I told her to grow up and call me when she comes to her senses but she’s hasn’t called me since.I told my other friends and they agreed with me that what Sandra writes is cringe and should have been called out and they don’t think I am the asshole so I’m still confused about my other friends’ reaction. I need impartial opinion. AITA for telling my friends?",

	"body" : "I'm 40 years old and live with my wife (34) and our two sons (7 and 5). I also have a 14 year old daughter from a previous relationship. My daughter's mom and I were never in a relationship when she got pregnant with my daughter. My daughter has always lived with her mom, she visits us 1-2 times a month on the weekends.For years ever since my wife and I got together we always do 2 trips a year for each of our birthdays. When our kids were born, we skipped the trips for a few years and then as they got older we left them with her parents for our little 4 day trips. Now that the boys are older, we took them to the Grand Canyon for my wife's birthday a few months ago. We were surprised at how good the boys are at traveling (quiet on airplanes, they don't mind walking for a few hours, just generally in a very good mood) so we thought we'd do something bigger for my birthday - a trip to Disneyland. This is especially special because I haven't been there either (I grew up poor and Disneyland was just too expensive). We flew out last week (before the Thanksgiving rush) and enjoyed 5 days in SoCal/Disney. It was a fun, fun experience.When we got back, my daughter (who has already been to Disneyland with her mom) visited and found out about the trip from my sons. I wasn't hiding the trip from her at all I just didn't think it was a big deal because she's already been there before. My daughter was very upset and said it was unfair that she wasn't invited or included on the trip.I told her that it was a family trip for us and that her mom wouldn't have covered her half of the ticket anyways. Her mom is not in poverty or anything, she's just a teacher without much cash to spare. I legitimately tried to reason with my daughter. If her half of the ticket was covered, she could've joined us. I've never had my daughter yell at me much less as much as she did that day. I don't understand the issue when 1 - she's already been to Disney 2 - her mom couldn't have afforded that extra expense 3 - my sons weren't jealous of her when she went a few years ago. I just don't get the issue. I told her that we enjoyed the trip so much that we're going back in March when the weather is warmer and that we'll let her mom know now so she can start saving for the ticket. She refused to hear me out and ended up insisting I drop her off at home. AITA?",

As we speak, TBS and certain other production partners of mine are developing a television/streaming show that delivers all the fun, drama, and outrageous behavior of AITA in a handy, bingeable format that requires almost no reading and, at last, will live in a space that is free of downvote brigades. I think you’re all going to love it, and can't wait to share the finished show, but it’s way too early for me to share any more details.For the moment, all I can say is that if you want to be involved, and you live in Los Angeles / Southern California, have a BIG, FUN, OUTGOING personality and a great AITA story, you should APPLY NOW.

	"body" : "I (41M) have an ex which I have 3 children with, one of which recently had her high school graduation. My daughter Angie(17F, late birthday) invited me to her graduation, and I’d said I’d be there. I am currently in a committed relationship to my girlfriend of a few months (41F), who has a daughter Lauren (24F). Lauren recently graduated with a bachelors in biology.A week before the graduations, I was then given an invite by my girlfriend and Lauren to her graduation. Her father passed away and she told me it would mean the world to have someone there to support her in his place. I agreed before learning what the date and time of the event was.Day of the graduation, I’m getting ready to head over to Angie and her mothers house to head off to the ceremony. My girlfriend asks me why I’m getting ready to early, so I explain its in two hours, got an hours drive and want to make sure I’m there on time so I don’t hold them up, as well as travel time to the venue - then she cuts me off to say that she had no idea that was today, and told me today was also Laurens graduation. Laurens ceremony was 3 hours after the start time of Angie's graduation. I did some math and figured I had time to at least be partially present for Angie’s graduation, give her the gift I had for her, and take some pictures beforehand, but my girlfriend was not too happy with the idea. Stating it would be devastating if I didn’t keep my promise to Lauren, and that I wouldn’t be “stepfather material” if I blew her off like that. I tried to explain I'd still be there for the entirety of Laurens ceremony with this plan but she just wouldn't listen, but wouldn't give me any reason why either besides just me \"owing it to her\" and her daughter.I let that get the best of me and gave Angie a call, told her I was having issues with my car and wouldn’t be able to attend, however I would see her as soon as I could to get the gifts and take her out to dinner to celebrate with me. I went to Lauren's ceremony later in the day. Of course I was in some of the pictures, which were posted on Facebook and I was tagged in them. My wife, and probably Angie too, saw the photos on my page.My ex wife is livid, saying I betrayed my daughter and blew her off for some other kid I barely know or have any responsibility for. I tried to play it off like we took Laurens car there but she didn’t listen. She said I could have done better, could’ve done more, with stuff like uber and lyft I could’ve gotten a ride if I cared enough to see her and pay the fees but I just decided not to and I don’t deserve to be in her life anymore. Angie isn’t responding to my calls to set up our agreed upon dinner date to celebrate her achievement. AITA, or are they just blowing things out of proportion ? I can understand how not even bothering to attend partially would make me TA, but I figured planning a day just for her separately would make up for that, am I wrong?Edit : me and Angie were never close. She's what I considered my \"different/boring\" child. Always on her phone around me, we never shared any interests, its not like we were buddy buddy. Angie always had social problems. I am quite close to Lauren. Shes very funny and outgoing, enjoys engaging in conversation/debate with me. - Added since someone said I barely knew Lauren.",

She feels uncomfortable with my wife's attempts to take on a motherly role. Additionally, my daughter believes that I've been treating my stepdaughter better than her(I don't believe I have) which has led to a significant amount of resentment.We've had multiple arguments about these issues, and it has reached a point where our household was constantly tense. We recently got into another heated argument due to my daughter cursing her stepmother out calling her the \"b\" word and in a moment of frustration, I suggested to my daughter that if she couldn't find a way to coexist peacefully with my wife and her stepsister, it might be best for her to move in with her mother.As a result, my daughter has gone to live with her mother, and both of us are dealing with a lot of emotional pain and distance between us.

	"body" : "I 46 M have been married to my wife Amanda 41 F for 6 years. When Amanda and I met She had two children from a previous relationship Chloe 17F and Marcus 15 M. Despite their father being absent, the children have never viewed me as a parental figure which does not bother me as although I love their mother, I don't see them as my children or feel any love for them. They're good kids, just not mine.Earlier this year Chloe expressed her desire to move out at the end of the year. I did not think she could realistically afford to move out. Her mother and I both work long hours, so Chloe leaving would mean I would most likely have to hire help or cut down my working hours as she does a lot to help out at home so her leaving would not be ideal. I handle all household expenses so In order to deter her from leaving I suggested she try paying a portion of the bills/home expenses to get an idea of what living alone will be like. Her and her mother both agreed this would be a wonderful idea and so we drew up an agreement that she would pay ¼  of the bills and household expenses and her mother and I would stop financially supporting her.I thought this would be enough for her to change her mind however she was able to afford this comfortably. I decided to lie to her and tell her that due to inflation our bills and expenses had risen greatly and she would owe me an extra $150 a month. My hope was that even if she could still afford to pay me she would not be able to simultaneously save enough money to move out.Recently her brother Marcus was doing a school project that required him to analyse our families electricity, gas, water etc usage. I foolishly allowed him access to my study to look over our past bills. At some stage he asked his sister to assist him in his work. When she was looking over the bills it came to her attention that I had been overcharging her for sometime. She worked out roughly how much money I overcharged her and went to her mother with this number. They are now calling me an asshole for stealing her hard earned money and are demanding I return the money. I don't think its fair to call it hard earned when most of it is inheritance from her fathers passing. I had her best interest in mind and think i was just teaching her how the world works, so AITA?EDIT: thank you everyone for your helpful suggestions, i will be putting the sum she estimated I overcharged her into an account and will tell her i was saving it as a surprise. Hopefully she doesn't come across this post.A response to some common themes in the comments, i would like to make it clear i have never cleaned my home and will not be starting now. I do not like the noise of the vacuum or the smell of cleaning products. Maybe i went to far by saying i have no love for my step children. I want to make it clear that i like them they just annoy me as they're not my blood.EDIT 2: you all need to get a lifeEDIT 3: I aged down everyone for privacy reasons which was my mistake. Many people are concerned Chloe is a minor I would like to make it clear she is in fact older however still do not wish to reveal her age for anonymity’s sake",

When Andrew was growing up, I felt a bit trapped in the role of a stay-at-home mom. Matt was (and still is) a great father and earned more than enough to afford all the necessities and some luxuries too (we had just purchased a new Infiniti which Matt had picked out) but I wasn't happy and was seriously considering asking for a divorce.One day I was involved in a minor fender bender while out shopping. I was driving our still fairly-new car and Andrew was with me. None of us were hurt but neither of the doors on the passenger's side of the car could be opened. Andrew was understandably upset, (and so was Matt). The guy who hit me, Raul, was actually very nice. We exchanged contact info, and honestly I really enjoyed talking to him. So I began seeing him whenever Matt and Andrew weren't home. Honestly I was happier than I had been in a long time, but I eventually felt guilty. I told Raul that I wanted to work on my marriage. So we broke up.I confessed everything to Matt, and he agreed to go to counseling. Around this time, I found out I was pregnant with a baby boy. We did a prenatal DNA test and it showed that Matt was not the father. I decided to give my son up for adoption after he was born, so that's what we did. Matt and I then had our two daughters. I've always felt guilty about the adoption, so a few years ago I did a DNA test and found my son, Diego. I was horrified to learn that grew up in foster care and had an unhappy childhood. He always wanted to know his biological parents. He found Raul and has a good relationship with him. I told Diego that I wish things had been different.Matt's parents, who passed away in 2021 and 2022, left half of their estate to Andrew, and the other half was to be divided between our two daughters. TBH I thought this was unfair, but it's the way they wanted to do it. The girls will receive their portion of the estate when they turn 18. I have yet to begin distributing the money to Andrew, and the reason why is that I feel strongly that half of his portion should go to Diego.I have told Andrew that I would like give half of his portion to Diego because it’s the least we can do to make up for the fact that I should never have given him up. He’s my son, and the only reason why I gave him up is because I thought it’s what I needed to do to save my marriage, but he’s had a really hard life as a result. Matt has taken Andrew’s side saying that not only is this this unfair, but it’s against what his parents wrote in their wills. I know that there’s the legal aspect, but there’s also the moral aspect of me wanting to make up for a mistake I made when I was in a bad place. Matt is now threatening divorce, while Andrew has saying some really horrible things about both me and Diego to pretty much anyone who will listen.Is what I’m asking such an unreasonable request?",

I get that it is hers but I feel like if it's something that came with her computer that she doesn't use, it makes sense for her to give it to my son who would actually use it to upgrade his older computer especially since she already saves a lot on rent.",

I am very close with my wife's family and supported her through the grieving process.On Sunday, my wife insisted I skip NFL and go to Home Depot with her, as our order was ready for pickup.When we got to Home Depot, there was an extremely long lineup, so I'm already annoyed having to wait.Out of absolutely nowhere, my wife starts tearing up and crying in the middle of this long line. I ask her what's wrong and she quietly tells me that the gentleman at the end of the line reminds her of her late father (my FIL) and she became very emotional and continues to cry. I got upset / embarrassed and told her to quit being so random since it's a weird reason to cry, especially because the gentleman looks absolutely nothing like her father.I then told her she is tripping out for no reason and she ruined the vibe for home depot dates.On the car ride home she called me insensitive and said it's not my right to talk about her father, even though it was obvious the home depot customer / employee looked nothing like my father-in-law.

	"body" : "Hey everyone. I (34M) am married to Angela (36F). Angela is bisexual, and while I'm genuinely not bothered by it or anything, I do like to make a joke out of her sexuality every now and then. It's never malicious, and she usually just laughs along. However, this past summer, I went on a tour of a US Navy base with Angela, our 5-year old adopted daughter, and Angie's 29-year-old sister. We went down to a submarine, and our daughter was freaking out about how cool it was, and we all had a good time. However, while we were using the ladder to get out of the sub, Angie's sister went up right before Angie. And her sister was wearing a skirt that day (with running shorts underneath, however), and my wife looked up and got a view up her own sister's skirt while we were making our way up the ladder. After we got out of the sub, I jokingly asked my wife \"did you enjoy the view?\" My wife took a second to process the joke, and then she said \"excuse me? What's that supposed to mean?\" She forced me to explain the joke right there, right in front of our daughter, which I didn't really appreciate.The aftermath of it is that after our Navy tour, Angela spent a few days at her parents' house because she was so upset about my joke. We did later reconcile, and although we're all living under one roof now, there is a bit of an uneasy atmosphere these days. In any case, I've stopped making jokes about my wife's bisexuality.Edited: to add that my wife naturally has a sense of humor about her sexuality, and she subscribes to subs like r/bi_irl and doesn't mind self-deprecating jokes.Also edited to add that I made that joke in front of my daughter, because she wouldn't have understood it. That's why I didn't have a problem with making the joke in front of her, but I did resent having to explain it in front of her.Last edit I'll make: While my wife was upset about the joke I made, I was also upset at her for not being graceful and making a big deal out of it. She didn't need to pack her bags and spend a few nights at her parents' house.",

I work in the same place she does and I've seen her crocheting at her desk during her breaks and lunch. My brother says it's how she relaxes, apparently it helps calm her busy mind.Every week or so, we have family dinners over at my parents house. Since SIL has been crocheting, she brings it with her. She just sits in the corner after dinner working on a project. My brother often sits with her and they'll talk quietly. Both her and my brother are quite introverted. If she ends up sitting with my wife or another sister in law, she's crocheting. I recently invited her and my brother to watch a film at mine and again she was sat crocheting through the whole film. It's rude because she's not paying attention to anyone.Tonight my brother posted a picture of them where they were out having a couple drinks in the pub. Yet again she was crocheting, it was on the table in the picture. In the comments she was joking with her friends that she'll be able to see where on her wip that she got drunk as it'll be all dropped stitches and she'll have to start again. Her social media is full of posts about crochet. About what she's working on, the yarn or patterns she's bought, or there trips she and my brother take to go to specific yarn stores. I've had enough of her being rude and I commented under the post that it was rude that she kept crocheting everywhere and she needed to stop being so antisocial all the time. She didn't comment back but one of her friends did telling me to eff off and that she can crochet wherever and whenever she wants. I responded by saying in that case crocheting is banned in my house, so she'll have to socialise in future. My brother deleted my comments before SIL got to see them. I know this because he told me when he messaged me telling me that I was being a prick and her crocheting wasn't hurting anyone. He said that she'scurrntly crocheting all the time because she's making gifts for family and friends - bs because we don't do gifts for adults in the family anymore. He told me that they wouldn't be coming around anyone until i apologized to SIL.

When I left, I threw it into the garbage.He called me 2 days later in a complete panic, asking if I've seen it. I thought about lying but decided to fess up.

I also pay for my younger son (clothes, food, haircuts, school supplies, doctors visits) and never ask him for anything for him.

Last minute all three of us got invited to a kick back lia’s boyfriend’s friend was hosting and it worked out that we all could go. The friend told us to be there by 6 but Liz and I wanted to go around 8 because we didn’t want to go to a party early. I should have realized what was going on because lia’s boyfriend kept texting her to drive over earlier and he would pay for an Uber to come get Liz and I later. I told Lia to just wait for us to get ready. Lia drove and we arrive around 9 because we wanted to pick up some alcohol. I was so surprised and kind of embarrassed to find out that  the kick back was a surprise party for lia organized by her boyfriend . I felt kinda bad because apparently the boyfriend was trying to get in contact with us to tell us about the party but Liz and I had blocked his number prior to this whole thing because he dropped us as friends earlier this year. The party was really nice tho. We kinda just left lia with her boyfriend because he doesn’t like us very much. I feel like he should have tried harder to contact us so we could at least got her there on time and brought a present like everyone else.

	"body" : "So I (22M) have a brother (24M) who's been seeing this girl for around six or seven months now. If it's relevant, my brother works 40 hour weeks, Monday to Friday, and works overtime quite frequently. He's a workaholic, if you will. On the other hand I'm unemployed and have been for a year now, I have my degree and diploma but am still job searching.My brother and I were born 19 months apart, so as you can imagine, we've always been very close. We always have done everything together, and still pretty much do. We have many shared interests. Golf, soccer, you name it. Except, now that he's in a relationship, a lot of the time we spend together has significantly decreased.Him and his gf are long distance, so they can only see each other on weekends, and even then, it's an hour and a half trip one way, and he always seems to be the one going up to see her. So pretty much every weekend he's not home, unless either of them have other plans. He's also wasting a lot of his gas, because his workplace is already over a half hour drive from our place, and to go up to her place is even further.Another thing I should mention is that she's a bit on the heavy side. I genuinely just don't find her attractive at all, I don't know what he could possibly see in her. She also has tattoos, which my dad does not approve of. He hasn't seen them yet, though, because she very strategically wears long sleeve shirts when she sees my parents, which has only been twice now.We met her over dinner several months ago, and I guess I must've been visibly offput, because my mom said after the fact that I was being very rude towards her. I didn't actually say anything to her, though, but I guess I looked really disengaged.Although I was still annoyed about my brother being away every weekend, the straw that broke the camel's back was the weekend that he missed a soccer match we have with our friends, which is a weekly event during the summer, to go to a function with her family.Though my mom pointed out that other friends of ours have missed games, too, I reminded her that the summer is almost over and so we would only have a few more games to play. On top of that, we film each game, so I had to go even earlier to set everything up by myself. I don't think it's right for him to ditch his friends and our weekly games over his girlfriend who he sees every single weekend otherwise.Now, we're going to a get together at our aunt's house for our cousin, and my mom told my brother to invite his gf, which he did, so now she'll be meeting one side of our family.Obviously I'm not happy about this at all, but our younger sister (18F) and our mom and dad are both fine with it, and are constantly telling me to \"get over it\" and accept that he's a grown adult who wants to settle down. I just don't think this relationship will last, and he's wasting his time. AITA?EDITOkay, so since I mentioned her appearance, a lot of people are focusing on that. Okay, fair enough, but let me add a bit of context as to why that bothers me so much. When my brother was younger, like early adolescent age, he'd make fun of fat people. My sister used to be on the heavier side before she reached her full height, and he would tease and pick on her for that. He doesn't anymore obviously, but he did. So I guess hypocrisy comes into play as well in my annoyance with the relationship.Also - it's not even just her appearance. She's quite irritating. She finds everything he says funny for some reason.EDIT 2So the overwhelming majority consensus is that I'm a major AH, apparently. I feel like, again, everybody is focusing too much on the appearance part of it and not as much on what I'm saying. Why is it only MY responsibility to get along with my brother's gf?? Should she not have to make an effort too?? I said after that she should've tried to make conversation that night we met her, but my sister said she probably felt uncomfortable to even try because of the \"look on my face.\"And again, I'll add - they're also on opposite ends of the political spectrum. At least, I thought my brother was, unless she's caused him to change sides or whatever. I thought nowadays difference in political parties was a bone of contention in relationships. So there's that too.",

	"body" : "I (35f) live with my husband and daughter Saoirse (9, fake name), and my stepson (16) lives alternate week with us.I named my daughter Saoirse because it was  my great grandfather’s sister’s name. They actually came from the country of the name’s origin. I thought the name was lovely so used it to name my daughter but I pronounce it the English way. So, I call my daughter SAO-ER-SE, like what you would expect if you see the spelling. It’s still lovely and my daughter is proud of how there’s no other Saoirse in her friend group.A few weeks ago my stepson’s aunt picked him up to take him to his mom’s. My stepson introduced Saoirse to his aunt and she said “Oh, what a beautiful name! Let me guess, it’s spelled Saoirse? You know, the (people of my great grandfather’s origin) will pronounce it SER-CHAY.”The aunt actually speaks the language. My daughter was all excited to learn why her name could be pronounced so differently and the aunt gave her a quick 10 minute course on pronunciation. My daughter loved this new name so much she insisted on pronouncing it as the aunt showed her. She introduced herself to everyone new as SER-CHAY from then on.This hurts me as I put a lot of thought and love into choosing the name and the English pronunciation I gave my daughter makes the name extra special for us. I asked my daughter to please pronounce her name the way she used to as it was the name I chose for her. She said it’s the “right way” to say her name and I was the one saying her name wrong all these years.I told her the next time she introduced herself as SER-CHAY I’m going to correct her on the spot. My daughter is now sulking. AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for kicking a girl out of a support group?",
	"body" : "I (F20) am in college. In high school, my friends and I were considered the \"weird kids\" because we don't party, drink, or go out. To provide background information, we were bullied a lot and I have developed anxiety as a result. A lot of my friends in college have similar backgrounds, but it's much better now because the more \"social\" personalities that would have bullied us in HS leave us alone for the most part, so I am doing well now and am in mental health recovery.Anyway, with finals coming up and spring social events being in full swing, my friends and I decided to start a student support group for fellow students with anxiety. We advertised it on social media and held it in a classroom this morning. At first, it was going fine. My friends and I were very comfortable because the room was full of people like us and everyone could hear and relate to each other, so talking about how we were doing was very therapeutic. However, about 10 minutes in, a girl walked in that I recognized from one of my classes.This girl, to put it gently, is nothing like us. She is incredibly social and is involved in things like greek life and admissions, and there is no doubt in my mind that if we had gone to high school together, she would have at least been friends with my tormentors. At first, we thought she was looking for a sorority event or something, so we told her that this was the anxiety support group. She said she knew and was here for that.I immediately pointed out that she clearly has no trouble putting herself out there, and I voiced my doubts that she knew what real anxiety felt like. She said that she's been having a tough time with finals and was hoping to talk to people that understood. I sympathized with this-- of course anyone can get anxious from schoolwork, but it wouldn't be fair to have her there around people that have been struggling with social anxiety for their whole lives and wanted to talk to similar personalities about our shared experiences.I told her as much, and that maybe the guidance offices could help with her schoolwork, but that having someone there that couldn't relate to social anxiety and resembled people that only make this issue worse can make the space less comfortable for people to be open in, and that I wanted everyone to be able to be open and to relate to each other. She apologized and left.One of the other attendees said that what I had done was horrible and that I had no right to suggest that she wasn't anxious. That wasn't what I was suggesting at all; merely that it can be harder for other people to share their true feelings in the presence of someone who can't understand, but I do understand how it could have come across that way.AITA?UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your feedback. I believe some of you missed my point-- I'm not saying she can't feel anxious because she is popular, I was saying that her presence could be triggering for other members of the group. That said, she wasn't in class this morning so I wasn't able to apologize for the miscommunication in person, and to be honest I don't know if I would have been able to without fear of being ridiculed again. After talking to my therapist, we agreed that I wouldn't be able to seek her out and apologize personally for the above reason, but I still wanted to make sure she knew that I wasn't trying to downplay her anxious thoughts. I reached out to the guidance office to let them know that she was stressed about finals so hopefully they will help her manage that. I also let her sorority know that she had come to my group via their social media DMs. Idk how good a bunch of sorority girls will be at helping her manage her anxious thoughts (LOL), but she chose to join and hopefully they'll know her mind well enough to help. After all, she has many friends that should be able to support her.EDIT2: Wow, a ton of you continue to miss my point. First, for anyone insinuating that she doesn't feel welcome at her sorority due to her anxiety and was trying to make friends with us instead or that maybe she felt unsafe with her sorority friends knowing about it, she is constantly talking about how welcomed and close she feels with them, so I figured they would be a good support system for her. I really do think they'll care about her mental health and want to support her. Again, they're not the brightest, so whether they'll actually be able to do that remains to be seen, but those are her friends and they can support her. Second, why would a person be embarrassed about having anxiety? If people were going to be unsupportive that would be one thing, but as we've already established, she has people that will at least attempt to give her the support she needs. Anxiety isn't something you need to be ashamed of and hide from the people you care about. I hope she sees that now. But yes, I was TA for kicking her out so abruptly.",

I know it was very wrong of me to do that but during that time my dating life was a mess and I ended bonding with my sister's bf whom was also going through a rough relationship with her and we ended bonding and developing feelings for each other.However I haven't slept with him while he was dating my sister, it was only a kiss to which he immediately confessed to, but since then she essentially blacklisted both of us, but especially me. I guess the guy didn't remain in our lives for so long cause I dumped him as well after an year of dating after losing the spark, but my sister kept up the name calling and the slut shaming me for years and even after countless apologies from me, she still hasn't forgiven me.I just found from my mom that my sister's getting married and that she hasn't given me an invitation to her wedding and when I confronted my sister about it she literally said that I don't deserve one. I told her that she's ridiculous and immature for still keeping a grudge for a mistake from almost 10 years ago and she just told me to go to hell. I tried contacting her fiance to explain my side of things to him cause I'm sure my sister overreacting the gravity of the situation to him, but my sister somehow found out and now she deluded herself into thinking that I want to \"steal\" her husband as well and now I hear she even wants to hire security from preventing me from attending (not that I wouldn't come if I wasn't invited).I really feel like she's doing the most about a 10 years old situation.

She is pretty flat chested and instead of dressing in a way that flatters her she wears clothing that looks EXTREMELY unappealing on her because it draws attention to her lack of a chest (think things like dresses, wool sweaters, sleeveless turtleneck tops).I told her that she would probably have an easier time on her next date if she embraced her body type and dressed more appropriately. I meant that as a confidence boost as in a \"be happy with your body!\" type way but she seemed pretty peeved and asked with what I meant with dressing more appropriately. I explained that her style draws attention to her lack of a chest so she should try to dress more like a tomboy instead of trying to look feminine. This seemed to annoy her even more somehow and she said that her tits don't define her femininity, and that her clothes don't even draw attention to them. I said that she can dress however she wants, but that she will continue having a hard time in the dating scene if she pretending to be someone she isn't instead of being herself.

Now keep in mind the due date actually isn’t even 2 days until after he would be getting back, not that it matters because their marital affairs are literally none of our business.As you can imagine his wife is upset with him over this.

Sam approached me and my other friend about the rude comments our girlfriends have made towards him about him “abandoning” his wife, and I’ve apologized profusely for her behavior and told him I’d address it.I told my girlfriend that she was out of line, that how Sam wishes to handle his domestic affairs is up to him, and that she needs to keep her nose out of it. I told her it was totally unacceptable how she was butting into their affairs, even if nominally doing so to defend the wife. She said that I’m not in control of her, she’s free to speak her mind, and I can’t tell her what to do. I rightly said that she can’t tell my friend what to do either, and that there’s a certain amount of expectable tact from a partner and that it was totally unfair of her to be hostile to a close friend of mine thus putting me in an embarrassing situation like she has done.AITA or is my girlfriend for placing me in such an uncomfortable situation by butting into other people’s business?",

	"body" : "Two months ago, I went back to full-time work. My MIL, who already provided a lot of childcare for my husband and I, became are youngest two children's (4M, 1F) main weekday caregiver. She watches them from around 8am till 6pm. She also picks up our oldest two children (7M, 6M) from school and my two stepsons (16M, 14M) spend a lot of time at her house. She has a similar arrangement with her daughter and her two children (7M, 3F).Previously, my kids already spent a lot of time at her house and my husband would often slip her some money to cover things like food costs. The kids have always really liked it her at their grandma's house. She still has her two youngest children living at home (16F, 13M), as well as her niece and her niece's son (5M).I recently found out that my husband has talked to his mom (without telling me) about paying her to watch our children. The amount he wants to pay her would be around $80 a day and it would be out of his bank account.I am against this for several reasons. Firstly, he didn't even discuss it with me before talking to her about it. Secondly, I think it's turning a family obligation to help one another out into a financial one. Thirdly, it will continue to incentivise her to not get an actual job (she's been unemployed for 4 years). Fourthly, one of her brothers is already bankrolling her and bought the house she lives in, I'm not even sure she pays any of her household bills, I don't want my husband and I to be the next chumps paying her bills. Lastly, she hasn't even shown any interest in us paying her, it was my husband who brought it up, I worry he's going to cause problems where they don't need to be any.When I brought up not wanting us to pay her to my husband we got into an argument, and he thinks I'm being an asshole about it. His argument is she is essentially providing the service of a nanny and therefor deserves to get paid for it and as we can afford to pay her for it we should. He also thinks she's likely to use the money to buy more toys and crafty type things for the kids.I think if you start paying a family member for childcare where do you draw the line. I used to watch MIL's youngest kids all the time when I was on maternity leave and she was working, arguably I should send her an invoice. And like I said her brother already helps her out financially, so she doesn't exactly need the money. Am I the asshole here or am I making some fair points?",

The easiest way I thought I should do this since no one wants to go (but if it works out better that I have to bring the minors with me then they will just have to come) is that I offered to my 19 year old to rent my house with her girlfriend, they would live with the other three kids and they also have their cats. I'd pay for everything else, because it is still my house and I still have to come here for work so my thought was crashing on the couch or something since it is still my place and the plan is to sell it. I wanted to ease everyone into the process of me moving and not have to involve other family to take in my kids.My oldest has voiced some concerns that I just don't understand. Her biggest one was that since I kicked her out to light a fire under her to get out and live on her own and enjoy freedom, she feels like now that I'm asking her to come back and pay rent and live here again that it contradicts why I kicked her out.To me this is totally different. Another thing was that she and her gf (who lived here to for over a year) thought it would be hard moving back in loving with everyone again including me part time, because of how “horrible” it was and \"toxic\" it was and how they don't want to go back to a “dark place”.She added how the house is in rough shape, lots fo broken things that’ I’ll eventually fix, front door lock is broken, and some water damage issues, and also appearance problems. I said we could paint whatever, i'll be their maitence guy, because it is still my house, but it seems that she doesn't like the thought of me having \"control\" over her which i don't understand. i've always been told i guilt people for supplying roofs over their heads, heat, etc when i simply want respect for what I do for them. Her idea was more so that she finds her own place and she did she'd take on my two youngest instead of maintaining a house, all 3 kids, our dog and her cats, cleaning, parenting etc. But to me it's a better deal financially and logistically for us all? And it doesn't feel right to have her take them on because then I'd have to sign a legal guardianship.She also says how everyone just wants this over with, just sell the house and I leave so they can start to heal. I have many reasons why selling would be more complicated right now, ans juat keeping them all in the same house while I'm gone and then crashing when I work for now just seems best for me financially and then like I said so no other family members have to take any of my kids in if I let them stay.There are so many details that go into it that I can explain if needed.So, AITA for proposing this idea to ny daughter after kicking her out?

I spent a lot of time researching providers that matched her health insurance and settled on a general budget that is absolutely up for negotiation based on what provider she ends up liking.We got into an argument when I gave it to her and she is staying with a friend, which she has never done before (she's been living in my apt for 5 months). She screamed and cried asking if I thought she was crazy or if I was unhappy, which is not the case at all! She is an amazing woman, has been getting increasingly emotional over small things and has talked about wanting to consider therapy. I think she would benefit from it because she is under a lot of stress from her job, has had some bad relationships in the past, and over the last few months has gotten increasingly irritable no matter what I do to fix things. I was trying to be thoughtful since therapy is something I wouldn't want to pay for myself since it isn't a \"fun\" purchase. We have been together for over a year and I thought that is what partners do for each other.She told the friend she's staying with (F29 or something) that I think she's crazy (which is not true!). I am just not a trained professional and when she complains about work and things I can't change, I don't know what she wants from me. I can't fix her problems because I am not doing them to her.

The package was around an hour for the shoot. We sat down to discuss what photos we'd do when the husband speaks. He asks if when we do the pictures where he's behind her with his arms around her, that he stand on a box or something to make himself taller. I must admit that the height difference was amusing. Him at around my height at 5'4 and her at say 5'8. I looked at the wife and asked her what she thought of it. His wife was in agreement to this. She said it was her idea as he's always been a bit self conscious and this made both of them feel better.I won't lie, I laughed and shook my head. I thought it was a ridiculous request. It's 2023, a man can be comfortable within himself to not be bothered about things like his height. I asked what they did at their first maternity shoot and apparently they didn't have a professional one (they already have a child) because of COVID so they did their own home phone ones.The husband got a bit red either from anger or embarrassment but he asked they could just cut that portion out entirely if the box trick was going to be an issue. Unfortunately I'm on a schedule and I have to do things according to this plan so no, I couldn't just cut a section out. I told them this and they said they wouldn't be needing my services and left.I told my friend about how strange this interaction was but she said I should've just done it. It was money and their shoot. Well it's my studio so I have a say in what happens at it? A few other friends have said the same but my sister said it was fair enough. He should've just sucked it up for an hour. Not even that.Idk now. I feel bad but I don't? Am I the asshole? Should I invite them back and just do it?EDIT; To answer what I see in the comments. When I mean schedule, I go through the photos in an order. Set A, B, C, D, so on and so forth. It messes me up when that order is changed and I can't think straight. You're right, it would've taken less time but not for my brain to process.Secondly, you're all angry at the fact I said the height amused me. The height difference was amusing.

She's had a rough life, and although she has a degree, she just barely graduated with a 2.0 GPA from college back when she was 24. This was due to the fact that she was both a drug addict and a hikikomori during her college years, and it took her 6 years to graduate from a 4 year program. I met her when she was in the early stages of recovery, and now she's a happy, normal person with her whole life ahead of her.It's worth mentioning that Maaya is a locally successful musician, and she plays the guitar. She's a bit of a wizard at the guitar, and she can really shred. It's her #1 passion, and she plays both solo and with a band.Starting this semester, my girlfriend has gone back to college to take remedial courses, because she wants to go to grad school to study applied math. So I applaud her on her efforts to better herself. Her college has a weekly open mic at the campus restaurant, where anyone can come up on stage and perform in a time slot. So I've recently found out that my girlfriend has been performing at these open mics for the past few weeks. When she told me about this, and she told me about how happy it makes her feel to perform in such an intimate setting, \"enjoying her second chance at enjoying a normal college life\" (to paraphrase her own words), I kind of cringed and told her that she was being cheesy. I told her that these kinds of open mics are meant for 19/20-year old zoomers, rather than the semi-professional musicians like her. Looking back, it's an odd thing for me to nitpick about, but I nevertheless believe that this is the truth. When I told Maaya that she was being so cheesy and that she's too old for this kind of stuff, I could tell that her heart was sinking, and she just sort of made these angsty, embarrassed noises.Later on, I hit up Maaya's instagram page, and I saw that she posted about what I said to her about the open mic.

I do feel bad for calling her a bitch and feel i went overboard, but i feel like i didnt like how she talked to me, and the accusations she made later. I rlly dont know what to think, no one else has commented on it, and other classmates just saw it as drama, so AITA?",

	"body" : "Throwaway, my daughter is an avid Reddit user.I (48M) recently lost my wife to cancer a year ago. It was very devastating for me and my daughter, Emily (17F). Three months ago, I remarried to an amazing woman, Jess (41F). We’ve been working together for several years and she helped me out a lot when my wife was in the hospital during treatments.Things have always been tense between me and my daughter, as she has always been a ‘mama’s girl’. They’ve been getting more tense since Jess and her son, Eli (8M) have moved in two months ago.To give background, me and my daughter live in a 2B2B house. When it was just us, my daughter and I each had our own rooms. Now that two more people have moved in, Jess and I thought it would be best if her son slept in my daughter’s room. Emily originally did not agree with this, but eventually came around when I told her it was either share a room or take the couch. I thought this arrangement was okay, because once she turns 18 I’m expecting her to move out on her own.Other than the room situation, Emily has been hostile with Jess and Eli since they’ve moved in. I cannot understand why she could have this resentment towards Jess, who has done nothing but try to be a motherly figure for Emily.Now, we are planning a family vacation for me, Emily, Jess, and Eli. Emily and I had made the vacation plans together right after her mother passed as a way for us to mourn together. I extended the invite to Jess and Eli after they moved in so we could all feel like a brand new family. I originally booked two rooms; one for me and one for Emily so we could have our own privacy in the evenings. But Eli has insisted on his own room, so he can feel like a grown up on his first ever vacation. I told Emily about the new arrangement, and told her I could cover the cost of a new room for her, but only half. I can only do half because I am taking Eli to Legoland like he was hoping for this vacation. I am hoping that Jess and Emily will be able to bond while I bond with Eli and our family will be blended by the time we are back home.I expected Emily to be okay with this, because she is a lot older than Eli and more mature than him. Instead, she totally freaked out and went off on both me and Jess, saying she feels like not only has her mother been replaced in eight months, but she’s also being replaced by the son I have always wanted. I admit I have always wanted to be a boy dad, but that doesn’t mean I love Emily any less.I love Emily, and I really do miss her mom. But I feel like I deserve to move on and get on with my life and find happiness. Why doesn’t Emily want that for us?So Reddit, AITA?",

My daughter has already moved out and said she will stay with friends this year. In order to make the most use of the free space, I'd decided 3 weeks ago to undergo renovations in my daughter's room and our home office. These renovations meant the destruction of her and the office's connected right internal wall and the mailing of all her things to her po box. Once finished, I called in my family and had them move into the now-renovated bedroom/office for the 3-4 week period between Thanksgiving and Christmas to save money.Now, the reason I mentioned this is because of yesterday's incident. My daughter, having just started to receive her stuff, called me confused as to why I'd done that. I told her about the renovations, why'd I sent over her things, and to expect more of them over the week.There was a brief silence (she usually does this when she is uncomfortable) and she explained how she couldn't take most of the stuff into her dorm on short notice and that she wished that I had told her the plan before renovating or moving anyone in. I told her that since she moved out the room was mine to do what I wanted with and that I couldn't hold any of her stuff as I already shipped it. I've come to regret being as irrated as I was and feel as if I could have involved her more but I was already on a tight deadline with the renovation and needed to move out as much stuff as possible fast. Aita?Update: So after my family and I finished eating, I called my daughter to see where she currently stands. She's ignored me for a bit but she just texted me asking if I'd finished sending her things(to which I answered yes) and that she intends to spend Christmas at her same friend's house.",

When I told my wife (30 F) that I was going, she asked me to also purchase tampons/sanitary napkins for her in the process.I had never done it before as she's usually the one who makes such purchases. I got kind of uncomfortable and asked her whether she can't buy it herself, and she said it would be much easier if I buy it myself as I am going anyway. She said it makes no sense why she would have to go again herself, and asked whether I had a problem.I told her that it would look weird for me to ask for one as I am a guy, and that I am not comfortable indulging in such things that are meant for ladies. I made it clear that some of the medicines I was going to buy are also meant for her, so it's not as if I don't care about her. And she was the one who's been buying such stuff for so long anyway.She was upset and accused me of being very much inconsiderate, and also called me sexist. She said that no matter what I said, I don't care about her and that I don't deserve to call myself a man or her husband as I won't help her.I responded by saying she was overreacting because I won't get something she perfectly can by herself, and that it's true I am not comfortable making such purchases.

	"body" : "I (20M) am in a college class that requires a group project as the final. I go to a pretty good school, so most people there, myself included, are very intellectual. My group consisted of myself, three other people that have a more scholarly demeanor, and one girl, who we'll call L, who is not quite this way. Not that there's anything inherently wrong with people like this, but she's very bubbly and outgoing, is a cheerleader and sorority member, and is honestly sometimes a little childish in the way that she interacts with people, i.e. talking to us like we're her friends rather than classmates. While the rest of us will sit down and immediately get to work in a group meeting, she will ask us how our days/weekends were, what we did, etc. Again, I don't see anything inherently wrong with this and can appreciate that she makes the group environment more fun.However, the rest of us naturally tend to take each other more seriously in terms of information for the project. The way I see it, the time that L spends at parties and with friends is spent by the rest of us challenging and charging our minds, so it's only natural that we are more inclined to listen to more professionally-charged ideas. Unfortunately, this has culminated in more than one instance where L will give an idea, the other group members will more or less disregard it, and someone else will say virtually the same thing and be praised for their genius. When this happens, L will just sink into herself and concede that the other members probably know better. I know it's unfair, but I don't really think it matters who gets the credit as long as the project gets done well, and this just demonstrates L's lack of confidence in her own ability. If she doesn't believe in herself, why should we?Today, we came across a problem that had a bit of a crossover with environmental studies (an environmentally-friendly solution was one of the criterion), and L immediately piped up with a solution since environmental science is her major. The group didn't really address her solution and continued to think of others, but we weren't really getting anywhere. L rephrased her solution, but since she was so uncertain in herself throughout the project, I really wanted to make sure she had thought this through. I asked if she was sure and if she could do more research, and she said \"I don't need more research, this is my major and I know what I'm doing\". At first, I thought she was needlessly aggressive, but after thinking about it, I can see how someone would be frustrated at a group for constantly shooting down their ideas, even for someone as farcical as L.AITA?EDIT: Some people have asked and no, we are not all men. There is another woman in the group who is taken just as seriously as the rest of us. It isn't about that.EDIT2: No, I don't stand up for L when her ideas are taken. That robs her of the opportunity of learning how to stand up for herself.",

I don’t know much about her, but I see her every day out on her balcony smoking. She doesn’t seem to ever be out her house and seems to be slightly odd. Besides that, I had no problem with her.About roughly 2 weeks ago, me and my partner were engaging in s*x when he opened the window because we were getting hot. After about 15 mins, I can hear that girl shouting up from her balcony saying “I can hear you clapping” “can you close your window”. My partner kept looking out our window at her to check if she was still there and she started saying “are you gonna close the window now then” every time he looked out. The very next day I was outside my block talking with some neighbours when she came walking past giving me a really dirty look. I just ignored her.Yesterday me and my partner were making love again, when about 10 mins in I hear her again basically saying the same things as last time. This time I looked out and said “can you mind your own business please, you’re embarrassing me”. She replied “then stop opening your windows, nobody wants to hear that, it’s disgusting. What about how I feel?”. I wasn’t about to argue out windows so I just closed my window but me and my partner were put off after that.Now today her mother pointed us out when we were leaving our block, asking us to “close your windows when you’re shagging” and that we’re apparently making her daughter uncomfortable and that she has PTSD. I told her that her daughter is making ME uncomfortable when shouting up to us while we try to make love.Basically she wasn’t having it and threatened us saying if it happened again she was going to make a report for “anti social behaviour”. Are we actually doing something wrong here? AITA? Please keep in mind how hot you can get when making love before deciding. Also for anyone who wants us to get a fan instead, we do have one but it just ends up blowing around hot air the hotter we get, which is why we open the window to let cold air in.",

She seems to be an insecure person, which I’ll admit, she wasn’t before me. Like when my best friend broke up with his girlfriend and I started reaching out to her, my fiancé told me that I looked like a predator trying to talk to a vulnerable girl. Anyway. I have a friend (Emily) who often invites my and my fiancé to family parties, at one of these parties I met my friends sister (Sarah). Sarah and I hit it off. We talked and laughed for a good portion of the night. I guess my fiancé was mad about it because I heard from my friends mom that she noticed that we were talking and that my fiancé seemed upset. That night my fiancé mentions that I was a little too touchy with Sarah and she was uncomfortable with the way we interacted.Anyways, Emily invites me to an outing. I go with her and her husband but my fiancé is working. Sarah shows up for a while. We talked and we had fun. She seems like a really good person. No big deal. I didn’t tell me fiancé because I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it. We’ll later at another function Sarah mentioned the outing out loud and my fiancé heard so it became a big deal. She asked me why I didn’t tell her and I told her that it wasn’t any of her business and she was overreacting.So here’s the deal. I found Sarah on Instagram and I messaged her to ask her for her Snapchat so that we could talk more freely. She even asked me if I would get in trouble and I said no I’m not doing something bad. Well my fiancé saw a notification from her and lost it. She asked me why I would add someone that she’s uncomfortable with and why I would think that talking to her on Snapchat is okay. I told her that she can’t tell me who I can be friends with. She said that I needed to remove her from my Snapchat and I said no that she can’t tell me what to do. It’s not my fault she’s insecure. So am I the asshole for refusing to remove my friend?Edit: Thanks everyone for your comments. You’ll be happy to know that my fiancé asked for space to think about all this.

My husband and I both graduated from the high school that our girls graduated from and boys are currently attending.A long-standing tradition at the high school is a beach bonfire party for the juniors & seniors after Homecoming. The party is synonymous with drunken shenanigans and all that stuff. I attended this party both my junior and senior year of high school. They were always wild. Dark night + outdoors + drinks + being on a secluded beach + all your friends + older guys = lots of fun as a teenager, terrifying as a mom.I'm 44 and I realize now that some of the things that happened at those parties were wrong. Older graduates from the high school attended, there was a lot of coercion/peer pressure to do things we weren't always ready to do, and plus just being in the dark in a secluded place.My husband and I both agreed that we didn't feel comfortable with our older daughter going. A few years later, our younger daughter too. Our girls have always been trustworthy but we attended those parties and knew how intense they got. My older daughter was fine with it while my younger daughter was unhappy with our choice at the time but hasn't brought it up in years.This year our son is a junior and wants to attend the party with his friends.

We agreed it was fine for him to go as long as he went with a group of friends and promised that he wouldn't get in the car if there was a drunk driver.

Pizza was abused in his first home and Sierra described him to Grace as \"reactive and terrified of men\". Sierra and her brother are working together to slowly expose him to being around men, and she has said that she doesn't expect Pizza to ever feel fully comfortable around them, but she hopes for him to eventually be able to stay in the same room as one without showing aggression.

I asked if I could go inside and see Pizza. Grace made a strange face and said that I never ask to go into Sierra's house, and that she didn't think it was a good idea because it might freak Pizza out.

She has been a mess since she moved with us and admittedly it was not the best circumstance and she claims that she's improving, even though I'm not sure that I see it. She had a hospital stay about a year ago and has been in intensive expensive therapy since.SD goes to school and works at her school but she has very few hours and is not taking a full load. Since she moved in, she's had some responsibilities around the house. One of those responsibilities is picking her brother up from school and watching him  and driving him to activities. She complains about this, so I think you'll understand why I think she's being a bit dramatic.SD's medication was recently changed. She was placed on a medication that was supposed to eliminate her nightmares and allow her to sleep. I don't know how severe they are, but today was her first day on them.At noon, I found her asleep on the couch. Naps typically aren't allowed, especially on a weekday when she needs to be doing coursework and chores. I woke her up and she claimed that she was \"out of it\" and \"couldn't stay awake\". I reminded her of our rule and encouraged her to be productive. I thought all was well until I asked her to pick her brother up.About 10 minutes after she left the house, my husband came running in panicking because he'd discovered her laying dazed on the ground after allegedly passing out in the lawn. Honestly, I was suspicious. She's very dramatic a lot of the time and a hypochondriac. When I asked her what she was doing, she babbled about the medication also apparently being a BP lowering medication and she'd passed out from that. Her BP is often low, but I don't see how this could've caused something like that. I think she's just trying to get out of picking her brother up but now my husband is mad at me. AITA?",

I also have a son (10) from a previous marriage, but I was widowed.My husband's ex is barely involved in stepson's life at all. They got divorced when stepson was 2, and his ex wanted \"a fresh start\" so my husband did the decent selfless thing and had complete custody of their son, even though he'd wanted shared custody.I got a bonus at work and I really want to go on vacation with just MY family JUST once. We've been on family vacations all together lots of times. But just once I want to spend MY money going on vacation where I'm not looking after someone else's kid. I want stepson to stay with his mom while we go on vacation. My husband sees my point of view and is okay with it. I don't think I'm being at all unreasonable.My mom found out what I was planning and says I'm being a complete AH. These are the reasons she says I could be the AH:My mom says that if stepson's mom isn't properly involved in his life, I should be even more involved in his life to compensate (I think this is a completely unfair expectation).She also says that I'm being a hypocrite taking my son, but I think that's totally different because my son DOESN'T HAVE ANOTHER PARENT. I'm all he's got.If stepson's mom won't take him just for once then obviously he'll come on vacation with us. But I don't think I'm the AH to ask if I can have a vacation with my own family just one time. It's not like I hate stepson or something, he's a nice kid, he's just not mine. Am I the AH?UPDATE:We definitely won't be going on vacation without stepson.After a couple hours of replies, I decided to show this to my husband. We sat down and had a really long talk about it. He told me he's never been comfortable with my attitude to stepson, but didn't know how to say to me before.I don't want to be a bad person, I just never thought of stepchildren being \"yours\". I don't think it would be easy for anyone to accept this level of criticism, but all your replies have shown me I have a LOT of work to do. As many of you suggested (and so did my husband) I intend to see a therapist to help me with that. As I said, I don't hate stepson in any way, I have never been deliberately cruel to him, I've just always thought of him as my husband's child. But I realize my mindset needs to change.So I'm going to start working on that. I want my family to be the best it can be, and I need to accept that it includes my stepson. I understand that now, and I'm going to start seeing a therapist to become a better person (we've also talked about maybe having family therapy too). I've also made up with my mom, and she is 100% behind the changes I want to make in my life.It wasn't easy to hear everything you said, but I understand that I needed to hear it.",

My 16-year-old called me to let me know she was disappointed and she missed me because I had to cancel last time as well I explained to her that Lana was struggling and I needed to be there for her and the kids, she got really upset saying that I love Lana and her kids more than her. I told her that that wasn’t true and I love Lana and her kids as much as I love my biological children. I told her that I could go to lunch with all of them and then go shopping and catch up, they all agreed and we had a great time up until Lana called me and told me she was feeling sick so I had to leave early and head home so Lana could rest. Now my kids are extremely angry at me and they are all refusing to answer my calls. Am I being a bad father or am I in the right? Also, feel free to call out any mistakes I’m not good with grammar!",

Not many of our friends and family have young children, and the ones that do are fine with getting a sitter for the weekend since we gave them a lot of notice. The only ones to put up a fight are my aunt and uncle who have a daughter with autism. She is 20, but will be 21 by the time my wedding day comes around. She is what they call “high-functioning”, which means she can talk and wash/dress herself, and she has some friends. She graduated from high school a couple years ago and is currently living with her parents (my aunt and uncle) while working at a grocery store. Despite her being technically an adult I just don’t see her as such. Every time I talk to her at a family gathering it’s like talking to a child. She is obsessed with toy ponies and barbie dolls, and brings them up at every opportunity. She draws in her notebook constantly and never makes eye contact when talking to me. She does not have loud meltdowns like other special needs kids I’ve met before, but I really don’t want to risk her ruining my special day. I told my aunt and uncle that I didn’t want her there and they became very upset. They said she already saw the invite and knew it was child-free but because she is an “adult”, she thought she was still included. My aunt tried to guilt me by saying she’d already picked out a dress and a gift but I didn’t want to hear it. My fiancé says I’m being an asshole and we should let her attend because she has attended other weddings before with no issue. Everyone is making me feel horrible for not treating her like an adult when she doesn’t act like one. AITA?",

	"body" : "So I 31f am married to my husband 34m and have been for the last 2 years. He has a twin, let’s call her Amy who has a daughter, Chloe 17f. Evidently, she had Chloe when she was young. Where they come from, this is not unusual.I am going to be honest, I hate kids, they are annoying and frankly, they can’t do anything helpful. My husband knows this and is okay with this, he loves kids but says he has no desire to have them.I have never gotten along with my SIL, probably never will. I frankly could never do what she did, throw my whole life away at that age just to become someone’s caretaker for the rest of my life. I come from a long line of women who don’t have kids until they are in their 30s and my mom always told me it was skanky to make a kid at a young age when you probably can’t even take care of yourself. Even if Amy is quite successful, I still think it was selfish to keep a child when you are a child yourself and when she did not even know if she could give Chloe the life someone should have.When we were at my SIL’s house yesterday she jokingly said “so is there a kid on the way or should I stop asking?”. I got irritated because she knows I don’t like kids, I answered “stop asking, not everyone is as selfish as you are and just care about themselves and what they think is best” she looked taken aback and asked what that was supposed to mean. So I basically told her everything i stated before. She started crying and my husband dragged me out. He did not say anything on our way home except “that was too far, even for you”. They have both refused to talk to me and he even sleeps on our sofa.So was I really the asshole just because I have a different take on the whole kid thing? I am beginning to think I am since he is sulking about it.",

	"body" : "I honestly don’t think this is even a big deal but my boyfriend is being very sensitive about it, so I guess I want an outside opinion.We were at my grandparents’ house for dinner yesterday. My boyfriend has met my parents and grandparents but this was the first time that he met my extended family. It was all going very well until my aunt started asking my boyfriend questions.For context: We’re from very different backgrounds. I’m currently in uni and he is working as a security guard. We actually met because he was working private security for a friend of mine and he recently switched over to working at a museum. I’m 23 and he’s 28.He’s a very sweet man and the first relationship where I didn’t feel like I’d have to put on an act for my partner. I think it might have something to do with his working-class upbringing and it’s one of the things I adore about him.My aunt asked him normal questions (about his family, where he went to school, what he does for a living, etc.) that he didn’t seem to have a problem with answering them. When he told her about his job she asked if that’s what he wants to do for the rest of his life or if he’s planning on getting a serious career. He told her that he likes his job and doesn’t plan on changing it any time soon.She then looked at the both of us and made a comment along the lines of “it’s a good thing your finances are separate then”. My father ended up changing the topic and I thought that was it. My aunt can be a bit direct and doesn’t always filter her words so sometimes she makes comments like this but they shouldn’ be taken too seriously.My boyfriend was quiet for the rest of the meal and didn’t say much on the way home either. When we got  to my place I asked him why he was acting like this and he said that my aunt’s comments were hurtful and that he wished I had said something. I told him that it’s not a big deal and that’s just how she can be and that he shouldn’t make a big deal out of it. I told him that if he ever does want to change his job though, I could talk to one of mine or my dad’s friends. He said he didn’t want that and that was the end of it for me.I texted him this morning if he wanted to come over later but he said he was busy this weekend. I asked him what he was doing but he didn’t answer me. I honestly think this behavior is childish and very unfair towards me.Edit: my boyfriend (not ex) called me back and asked if I had time. He'll be coming by in an hour or so. I agree that it might have been bad timing of me to mention my father's contacts but it wasn't meant to belittle him. Depending on his mood I'll try to explain my thoughts to him againUpdate: My boyfriend (still not my ex) came over last night. We talked about what happened. I apologized for not taking him seriously enough and he apologized for blowing things out of proportions over one comment. He agreed that at some point in the future (maybe once we have kids) he'd like a less stressful job but right now he doesn't want to. Neither of us even mentioned breaking up so you can all calm down. He's actually in the kitchen making breakfast right now. I hope you all have a nice sunday :)",

I think it's cute that she still plays in the band she formed in highschool. They aren't bad and neither are the songs she writes but that's not enough to live off.They play in pubs or the occasional town festival but all of them need to work a real job to pay bills. I'm not trying to devalue that. I'm currently at uni on scholarship but I still need to work a part time job to afford rent. My girlfriend is a very kind and warm person but she can also still be a bit naive about how the world works.We met up with a few friends tonight and at some point the topic of our plans for the future came up. My girlfriend said something along the lines of \"Maybe we're lucky and our music gets discovered so I won't have to choose an adult career\" She said it in a joking way and all our friends laughed except for me.She looked at me weirdly and asked why I was looking like that. I told her I just didn't think she should get her hopes up like that because her music was good but not special enough for her to turn it into a career.That kind of killed the mood and even though someone changed the topic quickly, my girlfriend stayed cold towards me. I decided to leave about 30 minutes later because it was getting late and I have uni tomorrow morning. When I told my girlfriend that we had to go she said that I should go without her and that she'll be staying with a friend tonight.When I got home I texted her asking her to please let me know when they left and when they get to her friend's place because I wanted to know that she made it there safe. She left me on read and even though it's past the time she usually stays out she still hasn't texted me.I'm actually a little pissed off right now because why is she being so childish now?

Brian is a smart and wonderful kid but a bit distant, spends most of his time in his room.  We’ve always had a somewhat difficult time getting along with him, but he gets good grades and behaves.  Brian goes to a college prep program HS in our city and is involved in many after-school activities and has a car to get around for them.  My wife and I both work so we can’t drive him everywhere he needs to go.  Also, we have made it clear since he was young that spending the night at a girlfriend’s house is a no-no.Brian has never dated, we figured he was just a late bloomer, but last spring he made varsity soccer and befriended a senior teammate, “Luke” (m18).  Luke invited Brian to his graduation party and after that they started hanging out a LOT over the summer.  Brian started to spend the night at Luke’s house multiple times a week, which is unusual behavior.  (I also checked Brian’s computer and found gay porn, but kept this to myself.)  We confronted him because he was out of the house 2-3 nights a week and he denied that he and Luke were having sex.  It turned into a yelling match.  Luke left for college in August and the subject was dropped.Fast forward to a few weeks ago, Brian came home and broke down crying after a swim meet and finally confessed that Luke had broken up with him over the phone at some point this semester because he couldn’t do long distance.  We comforted him and were very glad he finally opened up and we learned the truth.  However I informed him that he would be grounded from his car and some other things because he lied to my wife and I about having a boyfriend and sleeping at his house.He absolutely lost it and told us he wished he never said anything (which hurt our feelings) but did so because he “couldn’t take the pain anymore.”  He said I have said some homophobic things in the past (Disney shouldn’t have gay days, non-reproductive sex is dysfunctional, Gay porn is disgusting, etc.) and said he never felt comfortable telling us.  I told him frankly I don’t even remember saying those things, and I think they’re irrelevant/excuses for the fact that he lied about dating someone behind our backs.  Brian (like usual) stormed into his room and slammed the door.Brian’s grades and sports performance are now falling, he says because he has to coordinate rides everywhere and because he can’t hang out with his friends, but I feel taking away his car and friend time is the right punishment because he lied about sleeping over at his boyfriend’s house.

She has had periodic meltdowns, but for the most part this has been enough.  However, in the past year at college, she has been struggling to adapt to living in the dorms.  Her last semester's grades took a dive, and it seems like all the responsibility is greatly stressing her out.  I was under the impression that this anxiety was only a phase and that she would outgrow it eventually, but it seems to have only worsened after she turned 18.To make matters worse, my daughter hasn't yet gotten a summer job, and I think her nervousness is making her seem weird during interviews.  With each rejection email, I'd gotten more and more frustrated with her therapists.  I was starting to be convinced that they have been refusing to help her for years, since the longer she has anxiety, the more they get paid.  However, my brother, who has a psychological background, told me that it's common for anxiety to get worse during early adulthood and that her therapists are likely doing all they can.  I decided that he was probably right, and I stopped thinking about it.  I think I deserve quite a bit of credit for that.  Today, however, my daughter came home from an interview, telling me that it didn't go well, and I had enough.  I told her that she was going to have to at least make an effort to be normal and that staring at someone's shoes, rather than making eye contact, would never get her a job.My daughter was taken aback by my frankness, but I just kept going.  I told her that if she thinks she will be able to finish college without putting forth much effort, she was sadly mistaken, and that obtaining a degree is going to help her live a decent life on her own when she finally moves out of my house.  She began to tear up and told me that I was being unfair, but I chuckled and told her that life isn't fair and that she needs to learn some social skills or she would almost certainly end up homeless.  The thing that infuriates me is that she can look my wife and I in the eyes as she's telling us these sob stories, but she decides not to make these same connections with prospective employers.  I told her that she needs to maybe go take a walk and think about how her actions were screwing things up for her, but instead she stormed off to her bedroom and slammed the door shut.She hasn't come out for several hours, and I'm worried that her delusional thinking (that she will just be handed a degree or a career) is never going to end.  I tried sliding a list of tips for making a good impression during an interview under her door, but I heard her get up and tear them up. I'm at the point now where I just want to kick her out of my house, but my wife insists that I'm being too hard on her.

She said no problem.Now for context, we've been good friends for about a decade, and this was one of our mutual friends getting married from our friend group. I'm the only one in our friend circle who smokes, so I would occasionally step outside for a cigarette throughout the evening. At one point a girl who was working at the venue was also outside on a smoke break herself, and we started chatting and got along really well. After about 5 minutes she had to head back in to get back to work.I started to immediately kick myself for not getting her number because I thought we hit it off. I kept an eye out for her in the hall but I didn't see her again. When the night was wrapping up, Kate and I started to head back to her car, which was about a 5 minute walk away. I couldn't stop thinking about finding this girl, so I told Kate to go ahead because I was going to have one more smoke and I'll catch up. She said it's ok she can wait with me. I told her again it's cool, go ahead, but she said she didn't mind.We started walking again and about a minute later I clutched my stomach and said I need a minute and I'll see her at her car. She became concerned and asked if I was ok and basically wouldn't go ahead without me because she thought I was going to be sick or something. After AGAIN not going ahead when I asked her to I grumbled that I'm fine and we walked the rest of the way to her car.Once we got in the car I snapped at her for not being able to take a hint. She was really confused and I explained that I wanted to go find a girl I was chatting with earlier to give her my number, and why couldn't she go to the car like I asked so I could go back and find her quickly. She said she had no idea that's what I was trying to do and to go back now and she'll wait for me. I said it's pointless now because she came outside with some garbage and saw us walking together so she's going to assume I have a gf. Kate said she'll come with me to clear up that we're just friends and I said to forget and told her she's a huge c*ckblock for not taking a hint.The car ride home was complete silence, and when I got home I started ranting to my roommate about what happened. He thinks I'm over reacting, but I feel like ANYONE could have figured out I was trying to give them a hint MULTIPLE times. She cost me a chance at a girl I really hit it off with.

	"body" : "I (31M) and my wife (32F) have been married for over 3 years, together for nearly 10. We have a child who is now nearly 2 years old. Obviously, during pregnancy there can be substantial weight gain, and I know it is difficult to lose baby weight.I have never previously said anything about her weight. I have explained that when she was ready to begin exercising again, to just let me know, and she can take as much time by herself as she needs. I had read it can take months or until a new mom is done breastfeeding before ready to exercise again. Here we are nearly a year after breastfeeding ending, and she snacks often and I’m noticing that she has put on more weight from this time a year ago, which was already a year post-partum.I had explained to her even before we were married that obesity was a rather large concern of mine. I shared concerns about my sister’s weight, and the effects on her overall health. I’ve stressed the importance of regular exercise and healthy eating. My wife used to teach exercise classes and worked out regularly. We have a child now, and both have full time jobs, so teaching classes as a hobby is no longer an option.I know people on here will think that she’s the mom, so she probably does everything around the house, and here is dad complaining about weight. We share duties, I work from home and do a lot of the household chores and cook most dinners. I try to cook very healthy dinners, but that’s ruined with her other meals and snacks. When I get a break, I exercise. When she gets a break, she lounges and snacks. She’s probably worked out twice in the last year, I had to spark it, and I don’t think she appreciated it.I’ve since kept my mouth shut to see if things change, but nothing yet. I’m feeling this beginning to boil up in myself, and need to say something. Everyone says to just applaud efforts, rather than confront, but there has been nothing for me to applaud. Looking at recent pictures of us, all I’m beginning to see is weight gain and lack of self control.I’m scared a day is soon going to come when I can’t even say I’m attracted to my wife. I love her very much. She’s a great mom, great person, but an obese partner may not be something I can continue with, as shallow as I feel about it. Don’t mean to fat shame or anything, but I’ve made known was my perception for a long time.How should I broach the subject? Do I suggest exercise schedules? Point out her increasing weight gain? Mention the concerns this is casting to me in our future relationship? I sure feel like an a-hole, but I’m getting to the point where something needs to come from my mouth.EDIT: There has been no medical eval to see if hormone issue. Suggesting that sounds just as bad to me, but seems to be the first recommendation. I have already mentioned healthier eating in the house. I stopped getting any of my previous junk foods to help show I meant it, but she still gets hers.  I stopped getting frozen pizza and pastas, she still gets hers. She hasn’t stepped on a scale in months. If I had to guess, maybe she lost about 10lbs of baby weight in the first year, and has since put on 30+lbs in year 2. So maybe like 50lbs over pre-baby weight. She may want a second child, but I wouldn’t want to at this trajectory.EDIT2: There have been a couple of instances where she says she needs to exercise, and may create an exercise schedule for the week. Then just doesn’t. When I try to remind her what she said, she get’s irritated like I’m the bad guy for asking.FINAL EDIT: Thank you to those who were able to understand where I was coming from, and could sense the love I have for my family. Thanks to others for criticism that was CONSTRUCTIVE, even if you couldn’t see where I was coming from. Plenty of comments were not helpful whatsoever, but I know where I posted, so to be expected. Ultimately, this is a conversation we are going to have. I believe my wife would share something with me that was troubling her about myself, even if she knew it would be tough for me to hear. Tough conversations are a huge part of marriage after all. This is still a health issue in my mind, whether physical or mental. I have taken away much from this post, and will approach this conversation very gently, with my intent being that we are there for our child as long as humanly possible. There seem to be a good many of you who don’t understand or don’t care about medical issues caused by unhealthy eating/sedentary lifestyle choices…maybe look into it yourself if you want to live a long healthy life (IATA).",

The trouble started when I got up to go to the restroom immediately after the deed and she looked upon my nude body and said “you are SO skinny and your **** is so big.”  I responded “well there are lots of things I could say about your body that I choose not to.” My words seemed to hang in the air and before long she was unceremoniously headed home in a cab.Objectively, I’m about 20-40 pounds light for my height (6’2) and she’s reasonably above her optimal weight for her age (not that there’s anything wrong with that).  Roles reversed, I wouldn’t dream of saying anything that isn’t clearly positive to her in such a delicate situation.  That said, after the fact I’ve wondered if I was in the wrong.I’ve always been self-conscious about my weight. I’m a skinny guy naturally and gaining weight despite eating, sports, and working out is a challenge.  I think of “you’re so skinny” as pejorative to a male.  On the  other hand, there was a clear compliment in there and the remainder was either neutral or negative while my retort was clearly negative.  It’s worth noting she didn’t respond to my barb with kindness (there was no “I didn’t mean it that way” coming back my way).AITA?",

I was checking up on a patient we had operated on who was now in the neurology ward for a stroke. Since the patient had a hard time understanding, I gave him handwritten instructions.The next day, I got a call from the ward, saying I am expected to go there as soon as I can because Dr. Valentina asked for me. I go there to find a fuming Valentina who hands me that sheet of paper and asks me to read it. I read it aloud for her.She said there are 8 people here includings interns and med students and herself and no one was able to read that except for the one who wrote it. So she asked for the paper. I gave it to her. She threw it in the trash and said 'it belongs there if no one can read it'. And told me to write it down nicely this time and hand it to her patient.I did it and I can't really say anything because after all, she is an attending and quite well known in her job. However, when I was over in their house later, I told Valentina this attitude was wrong and she could have done it more gracefully.She called me an inconsiderate AH for writing that instruction that way and said 'no amount of words could express how angry she was'. She said the patient had lost sight in one of her eyes due to the stroke. And the other could barely see. Valentina goes on about how she, as a goddamn neurologist couldn't read my note, let alone this poor patient.Kate later said she would usually defend me but she knew her wife's work ethic and integrity and wouldn't question her on these things.

We currently live together with two other girls, her best friend and a close friend of mine.She comes home to the apartment in tears with her best friend who was consoling her. I didn’t talk to her until that night, when she felt better.She said sorry about my behavior, I said it was no problem. She frequently complains to me about her mom, so I’m use to it but she launched into a story about how she went to the bank to open up her first credit card, and found out she had a credit card open that was maxed out with 2,500 spent on it. She said her mom opened up a credit card on her name, hid it from her, and she had no idea. She admitted her mom did make payments on it every month.I told her it didn’t seem like a big deal at all, it sounds like her mom is building her credit and she’ll thank her in the future. I said if she’s making the payments, there is nothing to worry about.She said no, but she’s only making minimum payments and even then she’s spending what she put in. I asked if she said she would pay it back and she said “yes but.”I said no buts, she is making a big deal about something silly. Her mom is helping her build her credit, she should be grateful. She said but the credit card is maxed out, and has been at 2500$ for the past year.I said again she’s making payments, be grateful.

I initially said no because I live an hour away and only see him 4 days a month, but his dad offered to switch weekends so i was considering letting him go.However, i checked his grades and saw that he has a D in one of his classes.  I emailed the teacher and she said he has been on his phone in class and unfocused and not doing assignments complete.I texted my ex who told me he has been working with the teacher, counselor and assistant principal and our son for the last 3 weeks but the teacher has been relatively non responsive, gives students 0s if they don’t follow all instructions to a T, and takes forever to update grades after the students fix the problems.  He told me he already turned our sons phone off during school hours as punishment and the D is due to one 200 point assignment where our son received a 0 for not taking notes correctly in class and he is working with the teacher to help him redo it and turn it in the right way and the teacher allegedly said he could do this.  He also claims he has been in contact with all his other teachers and he is not acting up in their classes and this instance was specifically when there was a sub in class.  Needless to say I have difficulty believing my ex as I am sure he does not want to admit our son is not doing as great as he thought he would be in his care.My ex also is attributing our son’s academic issues on being new to high school and the school district and is blaming me for “not having any oversight and enabling him” the last 4 years and him switching schools a few times and that “his last school district was not good and he never learned any good study habits”.  Which is ridiculous because I tried very hard to get my son back on track when he was with me until my ex got the judge to move him to his district. Also his dad is enabling him now by trying to get me to let him go to homecoming when he is almost failing a class??I texted my ex and my son and said absolutely not, no homecoming dance due to the D and his bad behavjor in class, that I will not reward bad behavior and bad grades.  I also explained to my son that homecoming is for juniors and seniors anyway and he will have the next 3 years to attend.My son is furious with me, and I feel bad but at the same time my work friends are telling me I am doing the right thing by disciplining him when his dad will not.",

Though the computer I had before was still relatively new, I decided upgrading my rig would help me get more into 3D modelling such as Blender, as well as increase the quality of my video processing for my gaming streams to help gain some extra income for the house.My son (18M) asked me if he could have the old computer, as he was hoping to get more involved with this weird hobby he has with recording VHS tapes. He's been doing it at the library since they apparently have a setup for that and has shown me some of the videos he recorded, and I honestly just don't get the appeal. Two years ago I gave him my old Gateway, and while he told me that it wasn't able to do video transfers, I told him that he didn't need a thousand dollar computer either in order to do that.I have a hard time believing that the video transfer thing is what he truly wanted the computer for, and that he just wanted an excuse to play more video games as he's done before. While he is an adult, he's still only in Grade 11 due to delayed development as a kid. I only gave him the Gateway for homework purposes, but since I gave it to him he's barely touched it, so I'm having trouble believing he'd have put the newer one to use considering he hasn't been productive with what he has now.I was originally planning on selling the computer on Kijiji, but I had a blunder the other day after getting in touch with an old friend for the first time in over ten years. He came over with his son, we had a few beers and whiskey, and I don't know what got into me, but next day I found out that I offered the computer to his son while drunk.My son was in the room while my wife told me, and while I didn't initially take much notice when he left, I shortly after heard a loud bang from the basement and went downstairs to find out what the sound was, only to find him standing in front of his computer which he had smashed the heatsink and motherboard.I was shocked, while I only gave him the computer after knowing it wouldn't have anything important for me left on it, I did have fond memories of it like playing Unreal Tournament with friends and using Limewire for family movies. I was frustrated, but kept my cool and simply said to him \"congratulations, now you have no computer at all\", to which he barked back at me \"not like I could fucking do anything on it\" followed by other curses at me.

Liz has beautiful curly hair (dyed) ginger, I don’t know much about curls but looking at references i think she might have 3b or 3c hair.Last week she came to church with pin straight hair and her natural brown color. I was totally taken aback since she never straightened her hair, not even to formal events, and had been dying her hair for years. I asked what was the occasion, thinking she just straightened it with an iron, and she told me she got it straightened with keratin.I asked her why did she destroy her hair, and she told me I knew she had been really depressed and she wanted something “she could control”. I know she has been depressed. Around two months ago she underwent a knee surgery and has been walking with a cane, and just before new year her dog had to be put down. I get getting haircuts after being sad but i thought that was ridiculous.Her hair was the most identifiable part of her,  the way she would style it was very fun and you could find her easily in a crowd. Today i tried to find her at church and told her that without her hair she was harder to find, this bothered me because now she just melts with the crowd and isn’t that special anymore. At lunch i told her i missed her old hair and felt like she had lost her fun personality with her hair.She didn’t reply but i noticed she was upset, our friend that was with us at lunch told me that was mean, I didn’t think i was but maybe i should apologize, AITA?edit: okay i get it, i’ll apologize to her tomorrowedit 2: this morning at 9 am i texted her apologizing for my reaction to her hair. I told her i was just shocked at the drastic change, that she looks beautiful and i hope her new hair is easy to maintain. She replied with two audio messages 30 minutes later, i saw the messages but was too busy so I waited until i was free to reply. At 6pm i check the chat and realize she deleted the audio messages so I explained to her that i was busy, to send them again, but Liz replied “it’s fine, it doesn’t matter anymore” so i said great.Thanks to everyone who commented, I apologized and I think maybe shes a little hurt but we’ll get over it as friends.edit 3: today Liz was not at church, I ran into her boyfriend and asked where she and her sister were (she lives alone with her 15yo sister) and he is the one that drives them. He told me that she didn’t feel like going so she stayed. I texted her asking how she was and if could come over and bring them lunch, she answered that she didn’t want anyone to come over, that she was tired from work and didn’t want visitors. So i told her that if she needed to talk to anyone to text me.Around 6pm i saw an instagram story posted by her sister of the three of them in the movies (the story was posted like 2 hours ago) so i texted her that i wanted to talk to her and is she wanted i could go to her place or we could talk on the phone, it’s 7pm and she hasn’t replied so i’ll be waiting.",

Their father died almost a year ago.When my boyfriend moved in he expressed discomfort with having people in his home all the time. My older kids would come to visit Lori, and David could hear them all in the basement all of a sudden, in his space. David has some really bad social anxiety and didn't like not knowing. So I asked my three olders if they could call and let David know they were coming before they came in the house. Since then, they've stopped coming over all together, or so I thought. I really wanted them to get to know David, so I'm disappointed they're not making an effort now that they have a chance interact with him (Calling to let him know they're coming).Lori has been acting out in ways she never did before. She's ignoring me, snapping at me, not making an effort to do any chores. She keeps accusing me of not communicating with her, when really she's just ignoring what I am saying. She didn't 'know' that David was moving in with us, (even though she was told) because she just isn't listening at all. This is very out of character for her.Well, last week I found out that my older kids were coming over when David and I were out of the house, without letting us know at all. This feels very frustrating and violating. David is hurt and frustrated because he feels like they are being sneaky. WIBTA for telling my older children they are no longer welcome at all? I would still see them other places, just not my home.Edit: It was my home and David moved in with me. I didn't realize that was going to be important, sorry.Edit 2: The kids father was not a good man. I wouldn't say they're grieving about him as much as you're all saying. I don't think I'm rushing things with David, I have a lot of wasted time to make up for. I think the kids should be happy for me and understand the change in status quo.Edit 3: Wow, that's a lot of negativity over the fact I'm respecting my boyfriends anxieties. He doesn't like a bunch of people he barely knows in his house without letting him know. Lori can have her siblings over, fine, but maybe she should revisit her communication issues before complicating things. My kids have been actively cold towards David, whose doing a lot of good for me.

We have a set time everyday to call so we avoid scheduling anything during that time as much as possible.I'm flying out on Friday for a competition in which my team and I will be representing our university. During this time, I won't be able to talk to him at all for the next several days (phone policies + being busy with the competition). Thursday at our usual time is the last time we would be able to call before I leave.This is where the problem started... After I told him how I wouldn't be able to talk to him for several days and how Thursday would be the last time, he asked to call earlier in the day on Thursday (mind you, I have classes/office hours earlier so this makes things very hard, at least to talk our usual amount of time). I was confused so I asked him why. He said that a video game was coming out during the time we usually start calling and that he'd like to play it then.I started arguing with him saying he can wait an hour and a half until I have to leave to begin playing. I didn't see why he had to start playing it the literal second it came out. He argued back saying that he'd been waiting for this game for years and that he wanted to play as much as possible before he went back to work (he goes back the day I come back. In other words, he has nothing to do all day except game while I'm gone). I explained that he can play as much as he wants while I'm gone and he'll have extra time especially because we won't be talking like usual. But he's completely refusing to budge on this. He says that he offered to call earlier that day and if that doesn't work for me then we simply won't call at all.Honestly, I was very angry. He knows how much time and energy I put into this. He knows that I am extremely nervous considering it's the first time I've ever flown out for a school competition. He knows that I've never been a captain before and that this is a really huge deal to me.I accused him of prioritizing the video game over me and he just agreed to it and didn't really see the problem. He says whenever I miss a call, that I've prioritize something else over him but I don't really see how that makes sense? If he ever told me he needed me or was not okay with me not calling, I would 100% cancel to talk to him (unless it was something I literally can't get out of).He said he was done talking about this and that his decision was final and I'd have to deal with it and then he hung up on me. I messaged him back asking what the fuck his problem was and now he's mad at me for swearing.AITA?EDIT: Not sure why I'm being spam downvoted for random replies I make. Like if I say he will be asleep so it's not possible to call, like why even? I'm just providing context for the situation :/EDIT 2: I don't know what game it is. All I know is that he is playing on his own. We had no conversation about this game beforeEDIT 3: This is not a vacation, this is a competition. We have a schedule that we have to adhere to, there are rules we have to adhere to. I didn't make these rules, I'm just forced to follow them. Not doing so can result in disqualifications. For those saying it's ridiculous that I can't spare an hour a day to call during it: I am able to call once I got back to the hotel! He will be asleep during that time due to time zone differences though so it's not possible in the end. I literally can't at any other time.",

	"title" : "AITA for telling my wife that her reaction to a Christmas movie was inappropriate?",
	"body" : "On Christmas Eve, my family got together at my aunt's house and had a feast. It was a potluck, so my wife and I came with her homemade green bean casserole. It was a great occasion to catch up with my extended family, some of whom I hadn't seen in years. After dinner, my aunt made a pot of coffee, and someone noticed that \"It's a Wonderful Life\" was playing on TV.I consider this movie a Christmas classic, and I've probably seen it a dozen times or more, but my wife had never seen it, so we sat down and watched it from start to finish. When we got to the part where George Bailey is taken around Bedford Falls by Clarence, my wife began to cry. I asked her what was wrong, and she said that it was tragic that George had all sorts of opportunities in life, to get educated, travel, etc., and personal matters keot getting in his way. I couldn't believe that this was her reaction, as she had clearly missed the entire point of the movie. George was about to jump off the bridge because he was mistaken that his life was meaningless.I turned to my wife and asked if it would be better if Mr. Potter had taken over everything, and she said that \"both options were sad.\" One of the options was clearly sadder than the other, and I didn't see any of my other relatives crying. I told my wife that she was embarrassing us with her reaction and that she should stop crying. She was ruining what was meant to be a happy and lighthearted Christmas film, and I'm convinced that she was disturbing my family as well. When we finally left, my wife had pulled herself together, and she told me in the car that I had been cruel to her. She said that the \"only one who embarrassed us was me\" and that people have \"different reactions to movies.\" I asked her if anyone laughed at the end of \"Old Yeller,\" and she kind of went silent and shook her head. She muttered under her breath \"You're such an asshole.\"I don't know what to even say to her. Christmas Day was quite awkward, and she barely said two words to me. I hope this treatment doesn't continue through New Year's, but my wife seems determined to be mad at me. I just wish she could see my point, but she appears unable to admit that she was wrong even one bit. I'm getting really annoyed now. AITA?",

	"body" : "EDIT: Thank you y’all for your input. Among insults of me I found some genuine constructive criticism, and I will work on my anger issues, this was a wake up call. If anyone wondering, we talked and agreed that while this was the first time I acted like this towards her, I definitely have issues and she agreed next time heñp me restrain myself and find a good therapist, perhaps even the same one she goes to.I’ll try to keep it short. But TLDR; at the bottom anyway.I have a bad habit of being overly aggressive when I’m losing in a game I’m invested into. My girl was working today as a guide at some outdoor activity out of town. She likes to call me whenever she’s bored , though checking with me if I am available for a call, so we could talk about something to distract her. I have no issue with this. However I really really dislike when someone disturbs me from my alone time. And I tend to snap at whoever distracted me.She called 2 times. First time I picked up while playing, told her that I’m sorry but I’m busy playing. She understood and hung up, while sounding a little hurt. I get that. But then she called a second time to ask will I pick her up from the drop off point after her work or she will just get a taxi. Unfortunately by that time I was losing bad and it so happened that I was violently cursing when I picked up the phone. She thought I was screaming at her and hung up crying.Now, I have two issues with this situation, she didn’t check with me this time if I am available and called directly which caught me off guard, second, I told her I was playing, but she called again, instead of texting me, and she knows I always respond. Now she’s mad at me and says it was a asshole move to scream at her for calling me. AITA?TLDR; Was playing competitive game, fiancée called without heads up to blabber about, I told her I’m busy, she hung up, then called again to ask something important and caught me at the right moment when I was cursing at the game and mistook my cursing as a attack on her.",

I declined, saying this was a family only trip with me and my siblings. When I got there, all of my siblings had their spouses or significant other with them and everyone kept asking where my wife, Sara was. I told them I'd told her to stay home as I'd figured it would just be us and didn't expect partners to be invited. (Everything was planned via sibling group chat and while I didn't read everything, I don't recall seeing anything mentioned about partners being invited.)Later, once things had settled down, I called Sara and told her all of the partners were here too and everyone missed her. I also apologized for not realizing partners were invited. She then asked if she could get a last minute ticket and come join us. While we can afford for her to, it's near the holidays and last minute flights now are expensive and we'd be on a very tight budget until the next time either of us gets paid, too tight for my comfort. So I ended up telling her no, it's not really in the budget and to enjoy having the house to herself for the week.Sara said I was being unfair and if I could take a week long vacation without her, she deserved to do the same. I told her this wasn't intentional, and her leaving for a week would be purely retaliatory and petty. Sara said if I wasn't going to let her fly out and join us, it was only fair she gets to take a vacation too, instead she's stuck at home where she's got to work, take care of my 3 dogs, (our 19yo neice would happily crash at out place and watch the dogs if we asked) take care of the house, and it's going to be raining all week so its very dreary there. I told Sara she's being ridiculous and I don't have time for this as I've got plans to go out. She called me a jerk and hung up. She's ignored my calls and texts since. AITA?",

Amy is the type who's a bit scatterbrained, always misplacing her stuff. About three weeks ago, we went hiking and she left her backpack in my car. It wasn't anything fancy, just a regular old backpack.I didn't think much of it at first. But as days passed, the backpack just sat there in my car, taking up space. I figured Amy must've forgotten about it or it wasn't that important since she hadn't mentioned it. To be honest, I was getting a bit annoyed about it cluttering up my car.So, after about two weeks, I decided to clean up. The backpack didn't seem to contain anything of value – I didn't thoroughly check it, just a quick glance. It looked like some papers, a water bottle, and maybe a shirt. I thought to myself, \"Amy probably won't miss this,\" and made the decision to donate it to a local charity shop. I felt it was a good deed, giving something to someone who might actually need it.Fast forward to last week, Amy asks me about her backpack. She said it had some important work-related documents, a spare set of keys, and a flash drive with sentimental photos. I was taken aback. I told her that I had donated it, thinking it wasn't anything significant.Amy got really upset, saying that I should've asked her before doing anything with her belongings. She said it was irresponsible and thoughtless of me. I tried explaining my side, that it was just sitting there and I assumed it wasn't anything important. Plus, it's been weeks, and she never mentioned it.I feel like she's overreacting a bit. Yes, I probably should've checked with her, but also, shouldn't she be more careful with her things?

When my husband I were dating, he told me that he wants to spend all of his holidays with his kids since he and his ex agreed they would spend holidays together with their kids so they could be with both parents (which I totally understand but didn’t think it was that serious). Well a few days ago, my husband I were discussing Christmas and I suggested that we go to my parents house in Texas since he’s only met them twice. He immediately spoke up and said no, because he wants to spend it with his kids. I told him that missing Christmas with kids for one year wouldn’t be a big deal. He was upset and asked me why I couldn’t just come with him. I work very long and hard hours at my job and I told him I wanted to spend my Christmas relaxing and enjoying my time off without all the energy of taking care of his kids. I just want to spend it with him and my parents. He called his ex wife and told her that he might not be able to come for Christmas, which led to an abundance of drama as his children were upset. I told him he is fine to go with his kids and I can go to Texas alone, but he said he wants to spend the holidays with me and his kids and doesn’t want to pick. I feel like I’m always second choice to his kids and it upsets me. I feel bad asking him to miss a Christmas but it’s our first Christmas together married and I just wanted it the two of us.Thanks for all your responses. I really didn’t mean to come off as nasty as I did in my original post, but it has been very very frustrating for me. I love my step kids, don’t get me wrong. But spending every holiday and weekend with them can get exhausting sometimes especially since I went from having 0 kids, to having 4. I understand my husband wanting to be with his kids, he is an amazing father and they are so lucky to have him, and they always come first, but i always feel that in not important. I just feel that my feelings are not being validated. Having to spend every holiday and weekend with them and not mine sucks. We spent Halloween, thanksgiving and christmas last year with his kids. Then new years eve, 4th of July, and birthdays with his kids this year. I just want one holiday where I can visit family with him. I don’t think I’m asking for a lot. I just want a holiday with my side of the family.",

He's always had a ton of girlfriends, or just random girls he met at bars over at our place when I was younger, they were always gorgeous and i remember them always spoiling me with sweets, or doing my make up etc.Not too long ago, Liam married a woman (Meg, 36) he had met at work. It's awful, we had to move to her house, which resulted in me having move schools to one where I have no friends. She's always moaning about me. They're also expecting a baby in April, which I am dreading. Meg despises me, I'm pretty sure. She's making me follow all the rules she's created (no make up, no dressing how i want, no diets or going out), and she always talks bad about me to my dad. She's totally changed him as well, he just acts old and dresses not at all like himself - he's boring now, nothing like what he used to beThe other day, Meg and I got into an argument about my uniform. I rolled my skirt up a bit and I had make-up as well as fake nails on. She came into my room and started yelling, tell me to put my skirt down and take my make up off, I yelled back that everyone has their skirt rolled up, and that i'm not taking my make up off because most of it is minimal. Besides, Dad did take me to get lash extensions, so I can't just take them out.Liam ended up getting involved, he said to me that i shouldn't rile my step-mam up and just to 'roll the damn skirt down'. I then told him that it's not my fault he's not attractive anymore and had to settle for   Meg, and he shouldn't let her think she's my mam now.Since then, dad's been short with me for insulting him and his wife, and Meg has been even harder on me, saying that they got married because she is a decent, responsible woman and not because she looks like a doll.

She has a wonderful career that she loves, so returned to it. She doesn't really need to work as all our families are very fortunate in the finance department. But it does mean she has less time to do the sort of domestic things we do, so I wanted to mention it because maybe she's just used to doing quick meals all the time.Anyway, for one of our holidays we rented a big property. It had a huge rumpus room for the kids and was on a five acre property. It was only for three days, so between us the couples came up with a schedule where we each picked a day to cook so the others can take a break. Additionally, all the couples had a day with all the kids (at least nine under 11).On Dees day, she woke up and spent time with all the kids with her husband. They made pancakes with the kids, and then all the other meals for the rest of the day she just made stuff she had pre-prepared earlier, like marinated roast chicken (just stuck in the oven), or bbq chops (she had premade all the sides). Dessert was ice cream and trifle (basically very easy stuff). In comparison I and other SIL had put on desi full feasts so everyone had a really nice day. Ofc that also meant a massive kitchen cleanup. We didn't mind at all, but we're a bit disappointed that one of our days wasn't reciprocated in the kitchen by Dee.Is this a petty thing to bring up? I haven't been in the workforce since I got married, so maybe I'm overthinking this. Thanks",

To preface I am a very particular person. Especially with the correct use of utensils, placement of items in the household such as food and appliances and most relevant not leaving dishes overnight. With that being said my GF and I have a set of “terms and conditions” that we mutually abide by in the relationship. One of those being “ if one of us cooks, the other washes the dishes”. Now, I actually hate doing the dishes. Before this condition was set in stone it was an unspoken tradition. Though on occasion she would cook and I would ask her to clean and vise versa. To eliminate that frustration we had made this rule.  When she makes dinner I always wash the dishes before we go to bed, while she’d rather do them in the morning which I CAN’T STAND. Growing up I was never allowed to leave dishes over night and now it has stuck with me. It’s not only unsanitary but it can attract bugs. My GF just doesn’t understand that and we bicker about it every other day. Today I had enough.  I cooked like most days, and after I  relaxed and got comfortable.

We will drive there tomorrow, celebrate New Year there, likely stay another night, and then come back home Jan 2.The problem is my son cannot come since his passport is within 6 months of expiry. Also he has a dog and it's too late to find a sitter for his dog. So he is upset we chose somewhere he can't go. But he didn't like any of the nearby suggestions my wife made before anyway. He said he just preferred we all stayed home to celebrate like always, just eating together and playing some games.So AITA for choosing this destination he cannot go to, even though he didn't want to go anywhere anyway? He can stay home as he likes and I will take my wife and daughters on the trip since they don't have passport issues or a dog. I think he is just mad because yesterday I got some items at work that I gave to my daughters and wife. He is already working and making money, so he doesn't need a gift. Gifts for daughters were only worth around $200 and for wife it is half that. He is making everything about going his way.",

	"title" : "AITA for saying I would disown my daughter over piercings?",
	"body" : "My (55F) daughter (17F) has moved out of province for university. She's been mentioning piercings for a while and I told her I would disown her if she got them.A few days ago my daughter sent me pictures of piercings she just got. She said she was really sorry, but she has been wanting to do this for a long time because. She asked me if I would still love her. I said of course, but why would she be willing to throw away our relationship over holes in her body? If she got them that means she didn't love me enough to be scared of losing a relationship.I mentioned this to my oldest daughter (26F) who lives with me. She said that her sister had contacted her a few days before in a panic over how I would react. I asked my eldest daughter why my youngest would be willing to throw away a relationship with me after everything we've been through, but also why my youngest would think I could ever stop loving her.My eldest paused, and looked at me with I guess bewilderment and said it's because I said I would disown her. I told her I just said that to scare my youngest because as a parent, it's my job to discourage her from doing stupid things. Find me a parent who doesn't talk like that to their kids, and at least others' kids listen. My eldest rolled her eyes and said we aren't other people. I told her I'm a human being and I have the right to be angry and have boundaries. She said as a parent I have the obligation to model healthy communication instead of manipulation. I told her that manipulation is part of being a family, babies manipulate their parents by crying when they don't get what they want. My eldest stared at me for a long time, and then just laughed and said that explained a lot about me. She said babies \"manipulating\" (she used air quotes) their parents because they have no form of emotional regulation isn't the same as a parent manipulating their child with threats and lies and being surprised that their children start to be afraid of their parents. She's always bringing up this weak western parenting stuff and she's always twisting things in her head because she's sensitive and vindictive towards me for perceived slights I've made towards her.My eldest said \"Why did you ask me if I know nothing? Right before you brought this up you said you were reflecting on how it is that your children can both care for you and resent you.\" And I told her they're adults now so I don't care how they live their lives. She said \"Obviously you do otherwise you wouldn't be saying things like we're disrespecting you and trying to end the relationship by doing things that don't even concern you.\" She then got up, said goodnight and went to bed.Usually my eldest is mature enough to sit through a conversation like an adult, even if she gets emotional. I was surprised and now I'm wondering if I actually did something wrong, but she has no right to tell me how to parent. AITA?",

I'd never been to a wedding before so I didn't really know how to dress so I thought a nice dress would be fine.When I got to the ceremony my mom muttered something about what I was wearing being inappropriate, then she walked away. I didn't say anything because I obviously didn't want to start a fight on my sisters wedding day.After the wedding, at the after party (is that what it's called? the party after the wedding?) my mom started complaining to me about what I was wearing and said I was taking the focus off I'd my sister because people were staring at me. People were staring at me but not for long there eyes just lingered for a few seconds and then I don't know they probably went back to thinking about how gorgeous my sister looked. I attracted some attention but not as much as my mom made out.A little later my sister came over and said that I was selfish for what I was wearing and asked me if I was trying to ruin her big day I said no and asked her what the fuck her problem is. She called me a slut and an attention whore and we almost got into an argument but she walked away because she said that she won't let ruin her day.

We both had kids from previous relationships, I had 4 kids (20m, 22f, 30m and 32m) and he had a daughter (20f).Now, I love my husband and I love my kids, and I se his daughter almost as one of my own (I’ve known her since she was 13). The thing is I don’t get on all that well with either my daughter or my stepdaughter, I simply think that the boys are easier. My stepdaughter still lives with us from time to time, she comes over every other week or so. Like I said, I find her difficult.Ever since I first met her she has claimed to have “depression”, but I don’t know if that true, the girl just loves attention (she even claims to be allergic to nuts,no medical examination). I have managed her fits, her being “too depressed to go to school” and her general attitude and I think I’ve done my best to be a good stepmom to her.My own is just the same, claiming to have depression and anxiety due to her “bad childhood” and just sees the world her point of view, and in her point of view I have been a terrible mother. I think just like with my stepdaughter that I have done my best under the circumstances I have been in.The problem whereI might have been at fault started a few weeks ago. I had a few drinks with one of my closest friends while my stepdaughter was at home, we were talking about the struggles of raising daughters and I confessed to her I found it very hard to get along with my daughter, I said I honestly think my sons are much easier and It would be easier if I only had sons. Like I said, I love my daughter, I would not trade her for anything in the world, but she is difficult. My stepdaughter was in the kitchen when I told my friend this, and she got really angry at me, but I brushed it aside and told her that was just how I felt.Now at a recent family dinner my stepdaughter had apparently told my daughter I said this, and they both confronted me. They said I had always been rude to them both, emotionally abused them and would always get mad at them while the boys get praise. I guess the whole thing got a bit out of hand and I might have been rude and screamed at them when it was not needed. But I honestly tried to tell them that I just feel like I get along with the boys better and are better at handling boys emotions and it’s not like I don’t love them just because I get along better with my boys.I understand we all might have overreacted a bit at that what I said could be hurtful out of context, but the both of them refuse to talk to me because of this.

Also my wife's ex died in a sad incident in 2015.We met online, she was living in another city not far away. We started visiting each other and eventually got married. She moved into my house with her son.Her son is an amateur photographer and graphic designer. He has worked for a couple of small magazines and micro influencer. I don't know how much, but he makes money from that. He's never taken any money from me. I've never seen him take anything from my wife either.At first he was good with me and my daughter. We only argued twice and the second time I somehow ended up kicking him out of the house.I can't tell you the whole first one because then it's over 3000 characters. It's just my daughter said something about the troubled guys he hangs out with. I warned him. He didn't argue, but he was very irritated. After that day, he continued to be nice to me and my daughter, but it was very fake.Last week he had a photo shooting job and came home late. I told him that my house has an in and out rule and he shouldn't be so late. He calmly told me that he didn't come because he was working. I said him, \"I understand, but there are rules in this house.\"He said, \"Your house, your rules, but I don't think I can follow them when I'm working, sorry.\" That made me mad and I said \"Maybe I need to think about some things.\" He responded, \"Like what?\" Call me dumb for being provoked by a kid, but I got really pissed off and said, \"Like kick you out.\" His mom tried to calm him down, it didn't work. He said, \"Think about it. I'm waiting.\"I don't want to tell the whole conversation, but in the final I told him, \"Then get out of my house.\" He asked to my wife, \"Do you have anything to say about this?\" When she said, \"Let's sit down and talk in peace,\" he went to his room and locked the door.Two hours later he packed all his things, called a taxi and left the house. When I asked him to stop, he said, \"Think twice before you speak.\" My wife cried and begged, but he didn't listen to her either.The next day in the evening he called my wife. He was back in his home city, staying with a friend for a while and then renting a house. He's a minor, I don't know how he's going to rent a house, but he's already not supposed to get on a plane or bus by himself. I really don't know how he got back. Cunt is really like one of those annoying kids in sitcoms. Wife had told me before that he was very stubborn, just like his father, but I didn't expect this much.Things have been going downhill with my wife. I don't know what to do.

One year we spend Christmas with my folk, the next with hers. You know the deal.The issue is that her parents live in a different province than we do. My family lives a couple hours drive, hers lives 4 hours plane ride. So she pretty much only sees them once every other year on account of how costly and time consuming it is to travel that far.We had a son a couple years ago and he's never spent a Christmas with my wife' family. My parents got a double Christmas with him because we traveled there last year for her sister's wedding so I wasn't really interested in traveling again for Christmas.Technically that makes this Christmas my parents turn again, but more so than that my wife is pregnant with our second child.She'll be 7 1/2 months along by the time the holidays roll around and because of that I said it wasn't smart for us to fly.We've been arguing about it on and off for weeks now and I've been getting mixed opinions from friends and family. My family agrees with me, a few friends have mixed opinions and her family thinks I'm being a completely 'selfish' (like looking out for my wife's health is selfish...)The arguments about this are escalating to her just pointing out or bringing up every example of me doing something she thinks is wrong.It's getting on my nerves because 1) the whole trip will be paid for on my dime so I should get a say in how I want to spend my pay cheques 2) not wanting to travel when she'll be that heavily pregnant has nothing to do with how many chores I do or how often I help with our kid 3) I'm literally just thinking about her and our new baby 4) If something happens and she gives birth over the holidays what are we meant to do? Spend a whole month extra out there??I'm getting so tired of these arguments I'm almost tempted to just say I'm not participating in Christmas at all this year. I won't obviously because my son deserves gifts and festivities and all. But the temptation is there.Anyway. Am I being the AH here by not agreeing to travel for Christmas or is she being the AH by trying to push something I'm uncomfortable with?[Edit] just seeing a lot of people asking for same bits of info.why can't her parents just travel to you? : they can if they want to. I'll even pay for it. But only her parents. She has multiple siblings who split holidays the same way we do. They've all arranged to spend Christmas with her parents this year. So if her parents want to miss the Christmas with them and spend it with us then I will accommodate that but her siblings, their spouses and their kids can either pay for themselves or change their plans.\"your dime??!!! Your paycheck?!!\" : Yeah a trip like this isn't cheap and spending so much money on a trip that may not even happen that heavily pregnant is a VALID concern. I'm a sole provider and it would ruin the holidays for me if I spent thousands of dollars just for something to happen right before or during Christmas.Thank you for sharing your thoughts and opinions, I'll think about all that I've read.",

She’s kind of quiet, but when she finally talks she seems normal. I’ve sat across from her a few times and noticed how she was eating because it was weird to me. She eats maybe half of her food (keep in mind you control the amount of food. it’s cooked by the cafeteria staff buffet-style. she could easily take less) and kind of plays with it with her fork when she’s “done” (aka eating half of it, sometimes even less).I didn’t say anything for a while, but a few weeks ago I had to ask her why she always only ate half her food. She seemed a  embarrassed, but answered she thought she was more hungry and laughed it off. I then asked her why she made this mistake every time we ate, and that she must have learned by now. She didn’t really answer (I don’t actually remember, but it wasn’t actually an explanation) and left pretty quickly. She doesn’t really show up that much anymore, but when she does she still eats like this, and I couldn’t hold it in anymore. I asked her once again, and also asked her if her parents never told her not to play with her food.It was a genuine question, some people are raised in households where manners aren’t important, but obviously they are for most people. She got really mad at me and told me to stop commenting on her eating habits and that it was none of my business. I told her that it absolutely was since she was sitting at our table and obviously wasting food. She told me to go fuck myself and left and threw out the rest of her food (AGAIN!) After she left, one of my friends told me to leave her alone as she seemed like she was having a hard time and maybe had some sort of issue with food. Yeah, obviously she has an issue with food?? She keeps wasting it! She hasn’t shown up again, i’m assuming she buys her own food now, which might teach her not to waste it so that’s good. The same friend who told me to leave her alone keeps pestering me to apologise to her, but I think she should apologise to me. She’s unnecessarily rude when being asked the most basic and obvious questions and also told me to go fuck myself? That’s way more harsh than anything i’ve ever told her. Keep in mind that I care a lot about food waste and the environment. AITA for telling a girl to stop wasting food?EDIT: OK! I’m the asshole! Sorry i’m not studying to be an eating disorder specialist. I looked up stuff about it and i’m realising I was too harsh. I’ll apologise the next time I see her and try not to be so condescending. But you should all follow your own advice. If people genuinely don’t know something you should tell them nicely instead, and i realise i should’ve tried to educate her NICELY about food waste and not have commented at all on how she was eating",

A few months ago, J reached out to everyone proposing we get together, as we hadn't had time since John and Eliza had their first kid about two years ago. We started planning in August, and went to a French place that was difficult to get a reservation for. Everyone was able to make it and we all were ready a great night out.Now, I want to make it known I am a very big guy. I weigh about 126kg, so that inevitably means I am going to eat a lot. When we got to our seats, I asked the waiter what accommodations they had for a bigger person, as they tried to squeeze us into a corner booth where we could not all fit. I had a feeling everyone was slightly annoyed with me, as we had to wait another 30 minutes afterward for a regular table to open up. I mean, yes, I understand that, but this is a common theme when I go out to eat. I did mention it beforehand, so I'm not quite sure what all the glares were for.Everything was fine once we got to our table for most of the evening. Eliza commented that she would like to get home for the sitter at some point, and requested that we not take forever ordering wine, picking our food, and so on. Nobody took too long ordering the wine, and there seemed to be a general implied consensus to let John and Eliza go home sooner rather than later. This was mildly annoying to me, since we had booked this night 2 months in advance. I understand a young child, but there was plenty of time to prepare! I didn't even get to look at the wine list for as long as I liked.I have a massive sweet tooth. And this place makes the best souffle I've ever had. So when the server came to take dinner orders, I asked for the souffle right then, which I didn't think it was unreasonable to request it at that time, since that gave them time to make it. I ordered it with coq a vin, which they make from scratch. I was shocked to receive four glaring faces after ordering, and Matthew asked me to talk to him outside.Matthew told me I was being extremely inconsiderate, and even if we were planning this for a while, I needed to step aside. Having no kids of my own, this seemed irrational to me. I walked back in, sat down, and refused to look up from my phone for the rest of the evening out of protest. The souffle came right out when it was expected to, and John and Eliza were able to get home only about 40 minutes later than they intended to.So why is everyone so frustrated with me? Tara and Matthew have told me they won't be going anywhere with me anytime soon and they never offered any sort of explanation. John won't return my texts or calls, even though I've been explaining my side of the situation many times over.So Reddit, what gives? Am I the asshole??",

I swear, it was not my intention, but I snapped and told her those guys are not actually interested on her, they just pity her because she talks so much about her sickness that she must be fishing for some empathy.

My toddler then realises that he too needs to go so we, me, my bil and the boys, head to the bathroom. The line was about fifteen people long. There was no way in hell my kid was gonna make it.I looked around, no options, so I did the next best thing - I took him over to the sink. He was losing it, I had no other option. I washed it out after, apologised to the other people there and left. When my BIL emerged he was pretty pissed off and made a point of telling his wife about it.Someone also informed security who essentially told me not to do it again but in that kind of \"we don't care\" way, you know?My wife later on said she didn't agree with it - predators could have seen but imo they would have seen if I'd takem him to a urinal too. Its also unhygienic, but again, no worse than a kid who peed on their hands and then touched the sink. I scrubbed it after.My BIL said I was setting a bad example which I can agree with, even in an emergency. My wife said if it was that dire I should have taken him into the womens.So AITA?",

	"body" : "Throw awayI (42M) have a son (15m). In March of 2022 my wife and my sons mother passed away. This was devastating for the both of us. After 6 months I met this amazing woman who is now my wife. We both had spouses who died and we connected that way. We got married 5 months dating. (I know it was fast) My wife (39F) have a son (15m) and a daughter (16m). Our family blending process has had its challenges, but overall, things have been going well. My son seemed to love having siblings and loved my wife. However things started to change once they moved in (October 2023) because our house only have 3 bedrooms and so my Son had to share with his step brother while his step sister have a room by herself. We told the kids that this is only temporary and after this school year ends we will move into a much bigger house.After my stepson moved in the room with my son, he has been displaying disrespectful behavior towards his stepmother and stepsiblings. He's often rude and hateful. If he is asked to do something my my wife he'll roll his eyes or ignore her and not do it. He has locked his stepbrother out of his room multiple times and doesn't open the door until I threaten to take his phone or games away. Yesterday he decided it would be nice to lock my wife and step siblings out of the house while I was away at work. (She forgot her keys in the house) My wife called me and I had to drive home and leave work just to unlock the door. To say I was furious was an understatement.I decided to take my sons electronics away including his phone. I told him he's not allowed to go anywhere other than to and from school until I say so. I told him he is going to apologize and he is going to mean it. I'll admit I didn't say it as nicely as I wrote it but I was just angry that I had to leave work for dumb reason.My son is upset and feels I'm being unfair. He said that he never wanted to have a new family and he's getting punished for it. He said that he can't believe I'll choose my fake family over him. I told him that that's not true and I love him with all my heart.I said that he's not allowed to treat his step siblings or my wife and Im sorry you don't but that's no reason to treat them like trash when they treat you with love and respect. I told him that his stepsiblings didn't ask for this family either and that him acting this way towards them was selfish and inconsiderate. He then told me he wish I was the once who died. When he said that my heart broke and I left his room. I've been crying myself to sleep lately because I feel like I failed as a father and that's not something I wanted to do. I tried talking to my son but all he never verbally answers me. The best I get is a nod. I talked to with his grandparents (My ex wife's parents) and they suggested family therapy and I think imma try to do that. I've talked to my wife I'm contemplating on moving houses earlier than anticipated.Edit: I'm going to apologize to my son for dismissing his feelings and apologize. I never intended on hurting my son. I will try to put me and him into therapy. I just assumed he was happy about the marriage because he seemed happy about having stepsiblings up until October. I understand I'm the asshole, I understand I'm not good person, and I understand I'm not a good father. I will do everything I can to show my Son I love him. Thanks for putting it all in perspective.Edit again: I decided the best thing I could do for me and my son would be to divorce my wife. I love her, but I love my son more. I will be talking to her tomorrow.Edit 3: I allowed my son to stay home today so we can talk and I took a day off of work. I apologized to my son for making him feel unloved and told him that I was blinded by love and was too invested in my feelings and didn't consider his. I explained to him that I loved him with all my heart and I never intended on hurting him. I explained that when His mother died I was completely heartbroken and when I met my current wife she remined me so much of her and that I fell in love. I told him I'm sorry that I hurt him and I don't want him to hate me. He apologized to me and told me that he saw mom in my current wife too and he said that he felt like I didn't love him as much anymore and felt that when His step brother moved in his room he felt like he was being replaced. This made me cry. I apologized again and told my son I'm sorry forcing him to be in a family he wasn't ready for. My son said he doesn't want me to divorce my wife but he would like it if they would move out. I told him that I'll let this move in our new house from the time being because they have no where else to go. He said okay. Now I'm waiting for my wife to get off of work so we can talk about them moving and the future of our relationship.Edit: My wife called my Son Spoiled and a Brat so I'm filing for divorce. I'm giving her 3 weeks to get out of my house. I'm letting her take the new house I BOUGHT until she can find a place on her own simply because her kids had nothing to do with this and I don't want them to be homeless. I didn't know she felt that way about my son. However, my son wasn't near when she said that. We talked to the kids and told them about the divorce. My step daughter seemed fine, but my step son got upset and said I'm abandoning him just like his father and he started crying. I told him I would still like to have a relationship with him and I still consider him my son it's just that me and his mom are divorcing. He told me to Shut the fuck up and leave him alone and now he's crying in his room. Now it's tense in the house and I might consider her leaving earlier. I never expected it to end up like this.",

But she didn’t know until recently. We had some people over including her, and one of my roommates messed up the lie and as a result he had to tell everyone the boards true purpose. Most people thought it was funny except her. She was pissed at me. She said that it’s disgusting that we do this and asked very publicly if I made a tally for her.I said yeah and she was livid. She said she felt humiliated by that and grossed out that I basically told my roommates we hooked up. This is something I never did. No one knew we had slept together until she admitted it then.

My 14 year old daughter goes to her mother, and asks if she can keep some of the notes, as they were given to her by her late grandmother (from her mother's side).My daughter has started having attitude problems a few years ago, and would say things like \"It's fine, I can do it myself\" in a very rude tone to her mother and I, 62yrs and 65yrs respectively. We've reprimanded her before, and took away her electronics as punishment.I overhear my daughter asking, and loudly tell her that she shouldn't keep it, as it's a waste of money, and should be given to us. I could not see that she sorted her notes into piles, and pointed to two 20 USD notes while asking. She bursts into tears, and shoots back \"I'm not going to rip it!\" Her mother consoles her, while trying to tell me why our daughter wanted to keep it.Here, I was very angry at my daughter. She has consistently shown bad attitude, and that was the last straw for me. I stormed away, and around 5 minutes later demanded she apologize to me.She refuses to apologize, and insists she deserves an apology first, as she believes I was in the wrong for telling her to 'dump' the notes.

	"body" : "I (f18) have 3 sisters, 23, and 19 year old identical twins. My mom (54) is the breadwinner of our family, she’s the cheerleading coach at a large university. All of my sisters cheered in college, but the twins for my mom currently and my eldest sister just graduated. Although my moms denies it, I believe slight nepotism is involved as there’s not a statistical way I have 3 sisters cheer there without nepotism being involved.I cheered competitively pretty much my entire life until 2 years ago. I quit because I was done dealing with the politics on the team and the bullying I received from one teammate. My mom was supportive of me quitting competitive cheer as long as I did my final 2 school season which I did.I had always been very skinny and I kept that way for cheer, but after quitting competition cheer and with my school stunts being pretty much nothing, I realized I didn’t need to stay skinny any longer. For the first time in my life, I ate how I pleased and didn’t feel the need to exercise an excess amount, and I gained around 40 lbs. None of my friends or family have commented negatively on my gain until recently which I was very thankful for.As college approaches for me, I’ve decided that I’d like to cheer again. I asked my mom if I could cheer for the team just like my sisters, and she said no. She claims that because I didn’t do it competitively she couldn’t justify it and that I’ve gotten too out of shape, and she simply couldn’t keep her job if she allowed me on the team.My eldest sister wasn’t good at cheer at all, and the twins aren’t amazing. I feel like my mom is ashamed of having a daughter with fuller hips. I called my mom out on her fat phobia, and she claims that I am fat and if I can’t handle the truth I need to lose weight. This caught me off guard because in two years of me having a more full figure she never said anything remotely like this.I don’t want to be the only one of 4 sisters who don’t cheer in college, and I don’t want to just be a fat girl in the stands compared to my sisters cheering. My mom has apologized for her comments and has tried to say it’s more because I’ve not cheered competitively in years, but I know after her outburst that day it’s because of my figure and her embarrassment of my curves.I understand it’s nepotism, but there aren’t a set number of spots and it’s just who my mom wants. My dad is on my mom's side and said I understood that when I quit cheer this would happen, and my sisters won’t really publicly pick a side, but they have begun to make sly remarks on my weight out of nowhere. My friends do believe I’m in the right but know they’re biased and would support me regardless. I have begun portion control and lost 4 lbs, but it won’t be enough to get to where I was. I now rarely speak to my mom and while I feel like I have some blame I don’t think I’m the a-hole in this situation. AITA?",

She told me they do drink alcohol, so I drink 3-4 beers on the way to her house because #1. I’m nervous but #2. My fiancé said they drink, so I thought it would be fine. Well here is the dilemma…I didn’t eat that much before I started pre drinking, so the couple of beers hit me way harder than I was expecting. I showed up slightly buzzed but when I got there, they offered me some wine. I happily accept and start introducing myself to all of the different family members. Well my MIL apparently likes to eat dinner a lot later than I was expecting, so we didn’t end up eating until 2.5-3 hours later than when I arrived.By the time dinner came around, the alcohol had hit me HARD. I will admit myself, I was decently drunk. Without my fiancé preparing any food during the day, and my MIL having a late dinner, the alcohol was basically all my body had that day. This is super embarrassing to admit but I was really drunk as we were all serving ourselves dinner and I dropped my plate with a good amount of food on it.Obviously I apologized and offered to clean it up but by this time, my fiancé was pissed and wasn’t being understanding of the situation I was in, especially considering I was making first impressions with her family. By the time I went to get a second plate, I was becoming dizzy and ill, and realized I wouldn’t even be able to make it through the dinner, and asked her where I can lay down. She was LIVID as she brought me to her parents room, basically tossing me in the room and slamming the door, making a huge scene.

On top of that, I wasn’t expecting dinner to be served so late. My point is, yes I really fucked up but at the same time I wish she would cut me a bit of slack due to all of the other variables.Am I the asshole because I unwillingly got too drunk at her family gathering? I really want to add that her family was the one feeding me liquor, I was not serving myself.EDIT: yes I agree I fucked up in this situation and take full responsibility but I’m taking about how she’s still holding it over me and acting disrespectful to me",

It’s an all inclusive resort and my girlfriend is super excited because she’s never been to a resort this nice before. I’m indifferent because I grew up in a warm climate, so I don’t understand why people from colder areas have an obsession with booker tropical vacations. What’s wrong with going to Europe?Anyways, we were told the trip would be in April, so we told them we were in.

We were talking about the trip the other night, this is literally all she wants to talk about. I finally brought up to her that I was annoyed about the date change as March is towards the end of ski season, and I like to get in as many runs as I possibly can. Also, it’s spring break time so the resorts are going to be flooded with annoying college kids.I told her it didn’t make sense to me to change the dates because one person couldn’t go. She explained to me that it wouldn’t have been fair for them to miss the trip because they couldn’t take that time off of work. She then told me I was being selfish because I go skiing almost every weekend and sometimes even during the week, I can afford to miss a few days of skiing.I personally just don’t think she understands where I’m coming from. She doesn’t ski, so she doesn’t understand my passion for it. I’ve also traveled a lot with my family, so I don’t see the big deal of this trip.

She goes to the same school as Kay. She’s 17, same age as me. We hang out because of Kay, but we just don’t click. Her father wants to be an elder at our church (this is important).Over two months ago, I was with Kay. She said that Lacy told her a secret that she shouldn’t tell anyone, but she wanted to tell me. Before I could stop her, she told me that Lacy told her she was a lesbian.Lacy being a lesbian is a big problem if her father wants to be an elder. We believe that in order for a man to be an elder, his family has to be in order, too. If it gets out to other members of the church, he’ll never be an elder. If he does become an elder and it comes out, he’ll have to quit. It would be a social mess. My church experienced an elder gone bad (he was a charming narcissist) when I was a kid. It ripped the church in half and I lost friends. I felt like I needed to do something. I felt like it’d be too weird to talk directly to her parents, so I told my parents so they could talk to Lacy’s parents. They did. Apparently, Lacy’s father thought it didn’t matter because Lacy is an adult and her behavior has nothing to do with him. I mean, we’re almost adults, but I don’t think anyone thinks that. She still lives with her parents. I know he can’t just tell her not to be a lesbian. My parents thought it’d be best to tell another elder. Then there was a decision that Lacy’s father wouldn’t be an elder.A couple of weeks ago, Lacy came to me. Her parents are now really angry with her. She asked me if Kay told me she was a lesbian. I didn’t want to say she told, but I couldn’t dodge the question. I told her Kay told me, but I was trying to help her family and it backfired. Now, Lacy has told everyone that Kay can’t keep a secret. I’m pretty sure that accusation has spread at their school, too. Kay is so sad looking now. She’s polite, but she won’t really talk to me. She hasn’t been back to church yet. I think I ruined her reputation. Lacy is about to graduate but Kay has to be in that school two more years. Am I a jerk?

I haven't really developed a relationship with Stepdad and personally I feel like it's more on him than on me since he's joining the family, not me.Mom and I alternate custody on a weekly basis and I have our son this week. I picked my son up and he was wearing an In n Out hat. I jokingly asked if he went to In n Out and he said \"actually I did. Stepdad took me.\" I said today. He said yes. It was a surprise.I was furious. I called Mom and asked if she knew and she said yes. It was Stepdad's idea and she thought it was a good idea. I asked if she thought if it was a good idea not to tell me and she said she didn't think about it but in retrospect, no, because it's lunch with Stepdad.She asked if I was suggesting that she needed permission to let Stepdad take our son to In n Out and I said maybe. You certainly should had told me at the very least, out of respect. It was getting heated so I told her I was just going to talk to Stepdad which was unfortunate because we never had a real conversation and the first conversation will be a bad one. She said please don't call him.She ended agreeing that she should had ran it by me first BUT only when I have our son. I said, no, I want Stepdad to run it by me and all the time. Not doing it on my terms does nothing foster a good relationship between  us.It's very likely that I'd be okay with stuff like that but when I'm kept in the dark then I have to react.",

He excelled in school, picked up new concepts quickly, was the best at music, sports, good with girls, you name it.  After HS, I left and went to our states university and he went to a HBCU.  Since coming back, I’ve noticed over the years that when he’s talking to other black people he talks COMPLETELY different.  In comes the slang, the Ebonics, hell even the animated gesturing. However, when we are back with our old friends, it’s reduced back to his normal accent.  I mentioned something one time about his change in tone and he got a little pissed about it saying I should read a book and learn about AAVE, which is an actual language.  The thing is, I know about AAVE and it’s legitimacy, it’s just that growing up he DIDN’T LEARN IT.  Just the other day we were out grabbing food and the server was black and wouldn’t you know-  here comes the act again.  It’s all, “yo what’s good homie, lemme get dat sandwich wit da side salad N u kno I gotsta get sum dat… etc etc.” Anyways, I made a crack about it again going, “ah there it is again.”  He pressed me further this time telling me to explain what I mean.  This basically ended with him calling me racist and splitting on the lunch we had planned.  When the server came back and noticed he was gone I just nervously said that he had an emergency and cancelled his order.  I ate alone in silence which was awful.So, full transparency… AITA?EDIT:  So already a ton of feedback and it’s obvious ITA.  I asked for transparency and I got it.

Last night I worked through the night at my office (I have a couch and did sleep for a short time there) because I had a lot to get done, and it's a lengthy commute from work to home. She knew I was going to do this, it happens every month or two. She normally doesn't mind, though she did sound annoyed on the phone yesterday when she told me she and our youngest were feeling terrible.I came home around 4 this afternoon to find she had no plans for dinner, had done very little cleaning, and had not met up with our elderly neighbor Lucy, who's been needing help with a project in her house. I expressed that I was bummed she hadn't been able to help the neighbor, because Lucy can't complete the project on her own. That's when my wife lost her ever loving shit on me.She said of course she's gone nowhere near Lucy, because she is sick, and it's common courtesy to try not to spread germs to old people. I thought it sounded like a copout because my wife didn't seem all that sick to me BUT I didn't say that to her. She said I had some nerve asking what was for dinner after being gone for two days leaving her to do everything for the kids while she was feeling awful. You guys... the kids are 7+. It's not like she's changing their diapers and spoon feeding them.She actually said it 'must be nice' to make choices like I did last night, to stay over at the office, to order doordash and sleep on the pullout there like 'someone with no responsibilities.' She said she would have loved a little peace and quiet to recuperate from her illness, and I should thank her for being here to do what she does so I could do what I did. Okay, but it's not like I was at a damn hockey game or the strip club. I was working. She should thank me for doing that so she can be home while she's sick instead of dealing with a boss and racing to meet deadlines.I told her I'm not going to thank her for doing the bare minimum shit she should be doing, and I don't expect her to thank me for supporting us financially.

When we were younger, she was definitely the less focused sibling, and took 7 & 1/2 years to complete a 4 year college program as a result of changing of major twice.

Last night I took Sky to the park near our new home so she could run around. Sky is playful and loves making new friends but she is a big girl and can be intimidating to those not familiar with dogs so she is well-trained and obedient and comes when I call her name.There were not many people in the park last night, so I let Sky off her leash. As I said, she's a very obedient dog, so I have never had any issues before. I guess she got a bit too excited to be in a new place so she ran away and would not come back when I called her. I had to chase her quite a long way.When I caught up with her and leashed her, a man who was sitting on a bench with two small girls (maybe 4 and 6?) asked me if I was the owner. I said yes. He told me that Sky should have a leash and muzzle as she is a restricted breed and that she ran into one of his daughters, nearly knocking her over. I told him that Sky is very sweet and playful and would not have hurt his child intentionally. He said he's sure I'm right and that he grew up around pitbulls, but that I still need to respect the law and the fact that not everybody likes dogs. He said his daughter was fine and is used to dogs, but another parent might be very angry about this.I felt like he was being condescending to me, so I asked him why his daughter was not being adequately supervised. He told me that his daughters were playing just a few feet from him and Sky came around the corner so fast that nobody had time to react.

This is where things turned amusing, as my wife is a vegetarian and has been since she was four years old, whereas I am not. This has created some \"interesting\" situations between us historically, but this one at my BIL's was the most entertaining by far!My wife, quite seriously, stated to me that I will never be able to cook or eat fish in our house ever again if we kept them as pets. Me thinking there would be some ironic/hypocritical logic behind her statement asked her to confirm her reasoning, which she stated very passionately was actually that it would be cruel to do so where our fishy pets could smell the fish being cooked and see me eating them. At that moment, quite taken aback by what my wife had just depicted, my BIL and I caught each other's eye and proceeded to wet ourselves laughing.Clearly having gone over my wife's head as to why we were in such fits of laughter, my BIL and I started to depict some of the differences between gasses and liquids, as well as the intelligence levels and emotional consciousness of fish... but kept laughing too much, both at my wife's annoyance at us as well as our laughter perpetuating each other.Numerous references were made between us two for the rest of the afternoon, including designing solutions to catch and condense the steam produced when cooking any fish to then add to the fish tank's water in order to experiment with how our fishy pets would react. We again found this highly amusing (no doubt you would would needed to have been there to have laughed about it as much as we did), but my wife did not.My wife was, and still is today, very annoyed by us laughing at her expense having realised that her scientific logic was not prevailing at that moment in time. With further silly statements, ideas and GIFS shared within our family WhatsApp group, I am still firmly in the doghouse.I get that our reactions might have been a little over the top and we may have taken it a bit too far, but considering how funny my BIL and I found it, can I not enjoy myself a little at my wife's expense rather than being subjected to her being clearly disgruntled with my behaviour.

We supported her decision, she was old enough and working full time.The issue is rent in our area has more than doubled on average since.

I reserved a seat on a bus departing at 5:30 AM.Well, when I got to the bus station, I noticed that my particular bus was full. I couldn't believe the number of people traveling so early in the morning, but then I noticed a young mother traveling with two small kids. They seemed to be in a pretty good mood, but then when we all boarded, they started to throw a tantrum. The mother was trying to shush them and even offered them things like apple juice and toys, but nothing was working. Worse still, the whining soon became screaming, and it was extremely uncomfortable for me and the other passengers.I had planned to sleep on the bus, but with these little monsters making this much noise, I could barely even hear myself think. This went on for 15-20 minutes, until I finally had enough. They were sitting a few rows behind me, and I loudly told the mom \"Maybe you should try being a parent because nobody wants to hear that crap.\" I was the one courageous enough to voice what everyone else was thinking, but she took it as an insult and said \"How dare you judge my parenting skills. I'm doing my best and the kids are tired.\" I couldn't believe this. She literally admitted that her kids were tired, yet she decided to travel at 5:30 AM, and somehow that was MY problem?I told her that she should take a later bus if her kids were so tired and that it was completely unfair to subject the other passengers to these two screaming turds. She told me to \"get a life,\" and then put in earbuds so she could ignore me. When I finally got to my destination, I had a horrible headache, but when I told my family what happened, they told me that it was me who crossed the line. They said that the lady and her kids had \"every right\" to be on the bus and that I had shown a lack of tact. I couldn't believe that my own family members were ganging up on me in this way. I did the other passengers a favor by having this lady think twice about traveling at such a ridiculous hour with two kids, yet I was somehow the jerk. I'm really struggling to understand here how I could have been in the wrong, and I wish my family could see my perspective. AITA?",

	"body" : "My 30F partner of 6 months asked me to go to a surprise party for her moms graduation. This is the 3rd time I’ve agreed to meet her family in 6 months. It would have been 4 but I refused to go to her brothers graduation because it would have been awkward meeting her extended family for the first time at a graduation, and it’s not very comfortable being the only black guy among a white group of people. I experienced a lot of this growing up and she understands the uncomfortability.Despite this, I will still make it out to her family events because I know her family kind of expects me there. It also creates more questions for her when I don’t show up, and I don’t want her to have to deal with that. Even though she asks if I want to come, she on some level knows that it’s mandatory. Her family is white and rarely interact with black people so this enforces that it will be an uncomfortable experience for me. She understands all of this and typically feels bad asking me, and I think it ruins her time there knowing I’m uncomfortable. I still tell her it’s okay and that I’ll try find ways to enjoy myself even if I’m uncomfortable but I don’t think that helps.Returning to the original story. She asked me if I want to come to her mothers graduation party. I told her it’s basically mandatory at this point so yes. I likened it to being the same uncomfortability being the only white person among a group of black people and she said she doesn’t experience such things. I said, it must be great to live in a world where she doesn’t see color to which the conversation came to an end and we switched subjects. AITA for those comments?Tl;dr AITA for saying that despite being asked to family events, it’s basically a mandatory request and also saying that every family gathering is uncomfortable due to race?",

So I asked him if he could take another day off, since we would need to stay an extra day to catch the show. (Total 4 days).He then started to sound agitated and annoyed. We talked back and forth as to what workload does he have to not be able to take additional days.I calmly and softly explained to him why this short vacation was needed and it was just for him to relax and rest a bit.To make it short, he finished the conversation in an ordering and angry manner saying “I can’t. Also this extra day, I’m 90% sure I can’t.”I turned around in bed and cried, because I was hurt that he is unable to see that I’m doing this for him. What bothered me more is that rather than sounding apologetic and sad he won’t be able to take a short vacay, he was very argumentative and annoyed and all he did was fight with me.(I did not need a vacation, as I’m a housewife who works occasionally). It was for him.So while I cried, he turned his back to me. Then he asked “Why are you crying?” I then told him “You’re being an asshole.” He got angrier, and I rephrased and said “You’re being a bad husband”.He got pissed I told him he was being an asshole and walked out and left me in the bed crying.Now I’m in the guest room, alone.

So we each see one kid every other weekend so that the brothers can spend the weekend together.That being said, my older son’s birthday fell on his dad’s weekend this year and his stepmom and his dad went all out and took him on a staycation to celebrate. I am unfortunately not as well off as them. I did give him a card and $40 cash which he said thank you and seemed fine with us.While he was gone, it was my boyfriend’s birthday. He has been so supportive through all the custody battles and me struggling financially, and basically lets us live with him in his house rent free and helps me take my younger son to school and take care of our baby.  He is a great stepdad. I wanted to do something nice for him so I bought him the PS five bundle since he has been using an old PS4 for a while, we got a cake and did a mini celebration with my younger son and baby and him while my older son was at his dads.Well, I guess my younger son told my older about it and my older son is now furious with me.  He is starting to say again that I don’t care about him and I only care about my new family. However, he was the one who chose to tell the judge he wanted to go live with his dad. It’s basically his dad‘s fault that I barely see him now. I do still love him and care for him but he had already celebrated his birthday at his dads house.  He told me that he thought I would at least get him a cake and he thought the cake was for him when I took him to the store to buy the cake for my boyfriend, and that it was messed up to do that for my boyfriends and just give him $40.I guess I don’t really agree because my boyfriend is an adult and so obviously his gifts will be more expensive than a 15-year-old.So AITA?",

She wanted to come at 5pm, but I told her not to arrive before 6pm as I am exhausted from work and wanted to have a nap before she arrived.To my surprise, I heard the door knock at 5pm, when I was just getting into bed. She said that had caught the early bus, as she was planning on walking in the forest reserve near my house, and then come at 6pm. It started to thunderstorm, so she ran over to my house so she could have some shelter and asked if she could just stay on the lounge while I slept.I was furious that she didn’t show any respect to the boundaries. As far as I’m concerned, she should never have taken the early bus especially when the forecast was for rain. I feel like she did this on purpose because her original request was to arrive at 5pm.I told her no, she cannot come in until 6pm which is what we agreed and closed the door. I took the nap and when my alarm went off at 6, she wasn’t here and she had left a bunch of angry text messages. She said I was being ridiculous to say I haven’t respected her boundaries, and she only came early because it started pouring with rain. She said she was forced to walk to the bus stop in the storm and go home. I told her this was what she got for making a choice to arrive early and that personal boundaries are not there for the taking. I am not responsible for the consequences she suffered. She has now uninvited me from Christmas and says she wants distance in our relationship.So AITA for simply holding firm to my personal boundaries? I think she should never have put me in this positionEDIT - this is my only edit, but since it has been asked, my sister continually arrives early to any plans we make thereby disregarding my wishes and disrespecting me and the boundaries I set (she even arrived early once when I told her I was going to be with my BF before he flew interstate and it was our last day together and she came and interrupted).

Before the most recent argument, there have been a few other incidents in the past few months where we disagreed on gifts/donations. To be fair to her, she might be particular on edge because she found out there have been a few cases where I've been donating/gifting money without her knowledge to the tune of a few thousand dollars. Even though most of the time I always ask her beforehand.Recently, an acquaintance passed away and I would like to donate some money and buy some books for their son. I believe the donation will mean a lot to him and is a trivial amount of money to us. However, my wife disagrees. She asked me how much the book costs and I said $13. Then she said \"why don't you just donate $13 then, why do you need $200?\". Long story short, I think she is heartless, she thinks I am wasteful.In general, I dislike how I have to get her \"approval\" to donate money, makes me feel like I have no agency at all financially. When we got married, I gave up my job as a SWE in the bay area to start the family. If I kept my career, I think I would be making at least 200k-300k.

She thinks this is not financial abuse because if she wants to spend nontrivial amounts of money, she would ask me too, so the situation is symmetric.Am I actually the asshole?

She seems to be in a great mood on her work calls then after work complains about having to work while on her period. I know there is probably some mild to moderate feeling of your body being different but none of my exes complained this much, and I grew up with 2 sisters and nor did they.

I did not mean it in a way to belittle her, I just thought she should learn to deal with it better.EDIT: Ok maybe I should have phrased it better and been less accusatory towards her. I do understand she might be uncomfortable but I guess my problem was more that I did not like that it becomes the only thing she talks about when she is on it.

While we were planning in our group chat, most of the guys in the group pushed for going on Thursday night. This wasn't typical as we usually only hang out on weekends but I assumed it was just when folks happened to be free and didn't think much more of it.On the day of when we all arrived and took turns paying for the admission price, I noticed one of the guys in the group being charged a lower price than what I paid. At first I assumed that he had a coupon or something, but then I asked the cashier what was up. He went on to tell me that on Thursday nights the escape room had a \"boys' night\" promotion where all male attendees would receive 20% off their price of admission. I was caught off guard since the idea of a price difference based on gender hadn't even crossed my mind. I asked if the cashier if they also had an equivalent \"girls' night\" promotion and he told me no.I went on to ask the other girls in the group if they knew about the boys being charged less and it turned out they had no idea either. I was pissed in the moment but we were about to go in so I didn't push it further at the time.After I got home I looked on the escape room's website and sure enough, it had the boys' night promotion listed. I calculated the total price based on everyone there and figured out how much the boys would need to pay the girls back if we were to share the total cost of the group evenly. This morning I texted my calculation to the group chat and said the boys needed to pay the girls back because it wasn't fair that us girls had to pay more. After some back and forth the boys called me an asshole for being \"cheap\" and \"petty\"So AITA?",

She said if I want privacy I can pay it myself, and that if I want her to pay it than she has the right to look through the statements when they come because it’s her money. I won’t go into a lot of detail but she also made a number of slut shaming comments and now a few other family members know and are snickering about me.Her offer to help me shouldn’t come with strings attached is what I told her.

The amount wouldn’t hurt me but I don’t see the point in buying expensive things when cheaper items exist.I ended up getting Joan an eyeshadow that most color matched the one she wanted from a slightly cheaper brand and I burned her a CD of her favorite album (she has a record player but still. Also it wasn’t a shitty mixtape I hunted around for the best audios and tried my best to decorate the top so it would stand out) so she could more conveniently listen to it in her car or at work or home plus got her flowers and her favorite candy and made reservations for a nice restaurant.Joan seemed happy during our date but later texted me saying she’d rather have just gone to dinner than gotten the other gifts.I don’t get it.

	"body" : "So my bf and I have been together for 2 and a half years. We'll call him Adden. We're in college. I could definitely see myself marrying him one day. The thing is he has been lying to me and it caused us to have a big argument.We live together, and I share everything with him. I've told him all about my fucked up relationship with my parents and he agreed they sound awful. I've met his aunt, not his parents. When his aunt first came over she started tearing up the second she saw him and said she was so thankful he was okay. I should have picked up on the red flag, but I didn't.Well, I was on his laptop because mine died when I got a text from someone he went to counseling with. She basically said that she's sorry for bringing it up but she hopes his mom rotts in jail for a lifetime. She said she deserved it for what she did to him, and it makes her cry thinking about how much better he was doing.That night I asked my bf again about his parents and he said they weren't close, his dad died, and he doesn't remember much of his childhood. So I did research myself with multiple friends. It was easy because we knew his birthday, full name, etc, and it came out his mom was in jail for a long time for child abuse, child neglect, child endangerment, etc. The list goes on.I ended up confronting Adden about this and he confessed. He said he didn't like talking about it, but his mom was... well, crazy. She homeschooled him and would sneak drugs in his food to keep him relient on her. She was worried he would go to college, and wanted to stop that the best she could. Which it worked. He would be super out of it and sleep for a majority of the day. It wasn't until he turned 18 that he run away with his aunts help, she helped him get clean by locking him in a room without any drugs, and reported his mom.To say I was shocked would be an understatement. I felt hurt and lied too. He kept saying he had a bad memory, no. He couldn't remember his childhood because he was drugged out for most of it. I couldn't believe that he wouldn't trust me with this. We were best friends. I shared everything with him. He tried to explain himself. He said he wanted to start over a new leaf in college, he didn't want anyone to know about his past. He wanted to be a normal kid.But I still feel betrayed. I told him I feel like he doesn't love me, that's why he hid it. I mean. how many years before he told me. I also felt bad about complaining about my family when his is so much worse. But also, I feel like an addiction is something you should confess in a relationship. My dad was an alcoholic and it was hell to deal with. He said the difference is that he never chose to take drugs, they were put in his food. I said still, what if they gave you drugs after surgery and you got hooked again? Isn't this something I should know to make sure that doesn't happen? How could he hide this? AITA here?",

Despite being sick myself (really high fever & dizziness), I had to handle these additional responsibilities during finals week. So I have to present the entire presentation and I had to make them myself. Katie did help put all the things in a template (prettify it).I was initially willing to shoulder a heavier workload due to my absence during our class filming session because I had class at that time. But I was so sick (and had to fill in so much of her job in 2 days) that I lost the \"compassion & logic part\" of my brain and frustrated, I asked the professor to decide if we should receive different scores. I also gave the teacher Google slides & google doc edit history, cause I'm not sure either if I'm making this too big of a deal.Giving her this work distribution sheet, I'd made sure not to miss anything Katie did, she still did some stuff, quite a lot actually: see historyOUTCOME:The professor decided to deduct 30% from Katie's video project score and 50% from her presentation score.Katie is pissed off, saying she is in the hospital and can't do anything.But on the good side, this stuff is finished so I can't finally go to the hospital.Am I the asshole?edit:Why not ask for extension?I already asked the teacher if she will give us an extension or I should give her our work distribution chart. She said that I can give her either. So I asked for an extension and gave the professor our work distribution chart letting her see if we are doing unequal tasks and she can decide on whether Katie is getting a deduction or not.Trigger Point. Constant procrastinationThe presentation was supposed to be done two weeks prior as I urged her finish so we have time to practice, but she never bothered to care. She was hospitalized 2 days before the presentation and then told me I should do the presentation all by myself. And she is not going to work on the captions.

I wouldn't have minded being a stay-at-home dad but I have a better salary and we couldn't live on my wife's income.Even if I work I’m a super helpful dad and partner in general : I almost do every errance, I book appointments, I take care of my daughter in the morning before dropping her off at daycare, etc… and since the birth of our son I also do 50% of the bottles during the night.While my wife takes care of the cooking, laundry, dishes, sterilizing baby bottles, some errance, and the baby during the day.3 days ago we were at a friends apartment one evening with our children for a little gathering (2 couples + us). During the evening my wife took care of our newborn and I was responsible for watching our daughter. You should know that our friend’s apartment is on the second floor without elevator.And when it was time to leave, I took our daughter in my arms and I thought that my wife would take care of carrying our son in his stroller carrycot. But instead, she collected all the bags, and our daughter's stroller. And she asked if someone could help us and come down with our son and his stroller carrycot (which I admit is heavy but not impossible for my wife to carry). I didn't want to leave responsibility for my son on the stairs to someone else so I told my wife to drop everything and take the stroller carrycot.At first she did it but then she sees my daughter in one of our friend arms et she assume he will be the one coming down with us, and I will be the one carrying our son. So she collected once again all the bags and the stroller.But finally my daughter came back into my arms not wanting to go down with anyone else and that's when my wife disrespected me. I told her once again to stop with the bags and to take care of our son, she looked at me angry at the situation and told me : “You are really annoying me right now, someone else could pick the stroller carrycot with our son”.I did not at all appreciate the tone of his voice (which was really aggressive) and his attitude in front of our friends. At the end a friend or ours took the bags and my wife took our son.That night I decided not to help with nighttime bottles for our son because my wife had taken a nap with our son during the day.And in the morning, she expected a « Thank you » for doing the night alone and I told her she would not have it until she apologized for her behaviour yesterday.

We ended up talking about chores, and my BIL said he tries vaccuuming  in the morning if he doesn't have to be in early, does the laundry before or after work, usually does the dishes after dinner if he has dinner with her, otherwise he asks her to leave them dirt so he can do them once he's home, and buys them dinner once in a while so she doesn't have to cook, and he goes grocery shopping with her every weekend. But he doesn't manage to vacuum everyday because it's too early when he wake up and too late when he gets back, so my sister has to do the vacuuming frequently, laundry if he hasn't done it, and the dishes if he's extra late or \"she just doesn't want to bother him with it\", as she says. So I told him he's a useless husband, my husband does way more than him and I'm not even pregnant. He said he's \"trying his best\", \" but there's not much he can do if he's home for 2 or 3 hours when he's not sleeping\", etc. I said he doesn't seem to be, if he's letting my pregnant sister vacuum. I said he must have learnt that from his father because he seemed to be out of town for work all the time and didn't help his wife with much around the house as long as he was alive (4years ago).  My BIL was quiet the rest of the dinner and didn't say a word. My sister said I was out of line and I should apologize. I didn't, because I was simply being honest, and standing up for her, but she clearly doesn't seem to think so. She told her her husband he's doing more than enough and she said that I don't need to give my opinions on her marriage. They left soon after, with my sister glaring at me. I still don't get why she was upset, because I said stuff about her husband, not her.So, AITA ?",

	"body" : "I (38m) and married to a Lao woman(34.)  My wife was born in Laos and even after moving to America, her family made it a habit to embrace their cultures traditions.  As a white man born and raised in America it has taken me a lot to get used to her cultural quirks throughout our marriage.We have two kids (11f and 7f). Our youngest's birthday was just this past week and my wife insisted we celebrate it how they do in Laos. I was reluctant at first but in the end I listened to all of her requests and decided to oblige so we wouldn't have to fight over it. My MIL and wife told me that it was important that our kids were \"involved in their culture.\"The morning of our daughters party my wife was downstairs making Lao desserts and food before the guests arrived, some of these items  had a strong odor that I recognized and with such difficult names to pronounce. Throughout being married to her for 14 years, I've had to sit quiet and just let her silence my own culture and not teach our kids about their American side.This day I had made it a point to say something. The guests had arrived and I noticed some of them skipping over the food she had made. Luckily some of the kids parents brought small sweets along with their gift. While my wife was socializing my mother came up to me and pointed out the food.I was so glad she agreed with me on this and urged me to say something. When guests started to leave I asked my wife if I could speak to her. She told me I was being rude interrupting. This was my last straw and I blew up. I yelled at her saying \"THIS FOOD SHOULDN'T BE HERE NO ONE LIKES IT STOP MAKING IT!\"Both our daughters were beside her and she waved them to go inside. She looked at me and bumped into me following behind the girls. Later that night I tried to tell her that it's important our kids know they're American as well and she told me that there was \"no loving culture to learn about\" and sent the girls to stay with their grandmother that weekend.She's been giving me the silent treatment this week and only making dinner for her and the girls.

We only recently found out and I thought I could use my brother's (23M) incoming \"wedding\" to announce it to my close family, as my parents, siblings and even some cousins would be there. As I said, I thought this was more of a performative event and I didn't think my brother would be upset over my announcement, I actually thought he'd be glad that I chose his party to make my pregnancy known. However, he ended up being livid after I revealed my pregnancy, accusing me of not being able to not make things about myself for this one night in his life. I apologized and said that I didn't know he took this event so seriously, but that only angered him more and made him kick me and my husband from his party.My husband and my parents agree that my brother overreacted, but my siblings all think that I was a self centered asshole and I should give him a proper apology this time (even though I don't see anything invalid with my first apology, I really didn't think he'd be so mad over it).AITA ?",

	"body" : "So one of my (25F) closest friends (24F) and her boyfriend (25M) recently welcomed a baby boy. Out of all the names they could have landed on, they decided to name him Luca, after my ex, Luke. Luke and I broke up several months ago and it wasn't an amicable end to the relationship. However, Luke and my friends bf (Ben) are best friends and workmates, and they used to live together before Ben moved in with his gf, so they're extremely close. Apparently close enough for Ben to suggest naming his son after him.My friend knows our relationship didn't end well, so I was pretty hurt when I found out she was honouring him by naming her son after him. She told me that Luca was a name she'd loved forever, and that Luke is someone who is a really important part of Ben's life so the name just made sense. I don't understand why they couldn't honour any other male in either of their lives, such as their fathers or brothers, or even just use Luca as a middle name, but I can't change their opinions so whatever.I don't want to be reminded of my ex every time I see my friend's baby, so instead I decide to call him Jamie whenever I'm playing with him, from his middle name, James. I even made him a blanket embroided with that nickname. I don't see a problem, because I think it's perfectly normal for people to have nicknames that are only used by one person. Even for myself, my uncle has his own nickname for me that no one else uses. But my friend got upset when she saw the blanket and heard me addressing him by that name, saying it was childish and disrespectful and it was erasing part of her son's identity.I asked her what she expected from me after naming her son after my ex, and she told me that I was being self-centred and that just because I had a bad relationship with Luke, doesn't mean she or Ben did, so I can't expect her to take into account my feelings with everything related to her son.I think that not naming her son after a person who I just ended a long term relationship with is not a farfetched request at all, and her violating that request is just an invitation for me to address her son by whatever nickname I choose.Also it's worth noting that Me and Luke where together before her and Ben were, so it's not like she had known Luke for a long period of time or had any sort of relationship or interactions with him before I started dating him.So AITA?",

He said he didn’t like that because it was showing my ego. From his perspective, we were both comfortable and warm in bed and I could’ve gotten up to get it myself. Why should he get up and do it when I’m perfectly capable of it? He also said I was being lazy.I explained that yes, I was comfortable in bed and that is probably why I asked him to grab me some water in that moment. But I asked because it was something I would appreciate from him, and it would make me happy. Why wouldn’t he want to do that simple gesture? I’m having trouble wrapping my head around his resistance for doing nice things for me.I told him if he asked me to do the same of course I would because I want to make him happy and I know it’s something he’d appreciate. He said he would never ask me to do that though, because he’s perfectly capable of doing it himself.Am I letting my ego show? Please help, I don’t want to be an asshole :(Edit: My own curiosity has gotten the best of me. Those who are commenting, I would love to know if you are currently in relationship. I wonder if this has any baring over one’s opinion? I’ve been getting very mixed responses and am genuinely curious.Edit 2: Someone said I should add this comment I made to give more context since here it is!“Not trying to defend myself (well, I guess by definition I am haha) but when I think about it I do feel I do things for my boyfriend to try and show I care. I’ll clean his apartment when he’s at work, make the bed for him even though it’s not something he does for himself, etc. I think this might be why I didn’t think it was the biggest deal to ask him to do a favor for me.”Edit 3 (and most likely final): A lot more people have chimed into this post than I initially expected. I’ve been trying to respond to people who have (mostly) civil.Wanted to clear a few things up: A lot of people have been mentioning I am “playing mind games” by asking if he could get me a glass of water. While I can’t know for sure if that’s what I was doing subconsciously, I promise it was not that deep lol. It was such a fleeting moment. To me I was just asking a favor, just as he has asked me in other scenarios.I didn’t demand, I asked. And he said sure. A LOT of assumptions are being made about the type of people my boyfriend and I are. If you need more info, just ask me to clarify and I’ll be upfront and honest. It’s crazy to me that people are assuming I “constantly nag” and am “purposefully manipulating” him. Same goes for my boyfriend, please don’t assume he’s a terrible person I should just ditch. After reading through the comments, I think at the end of the day we show our love in different ways. A lot of people have been saying my love language is acts of service and it made sense to me.Edit 4: Forgot to mention another assumption being made. This is my fault for not being clear in the comments. We weren’t laying in bed saying our goodnights with the lights out. We were watching TV and both occasionally getting up to go to the bathroom or something like that. Not sure if this makes a difference for people.",

We made the decision to wait to tell our families until Christmas 2023 as a dun Christmas surprise.When we went to see my mom, I was prepared for her to say something about it because she thinks we are rushing into things too quickly and she is a bit of a helicopter mom. When we told her, her reaction was exactly that. She did say she was happy for us but told us we should hold off on the wedding for a couple years (i.e. 2026 or later) to make sure we want to get married. We both just brushed it off and our plan is still to get married in October of 2024.We told the rest of my close family/friends and so far everyone else has been really happy for us besides my grandmother (mom's mom). My grandma reacted the same way as my mom but has told us multiple times that she is happy for us and has welcomed my fiance with open arms so I'm not too worried.Currently the problem is that every time I even mention the wedding (and sometimes when I don't) my mom has to bring up that we should wait to get married. She doesn't even listen to me when I tell her that my fiance is the love of my life/soulmate and neither my fiance or I can think of a way that we wouldn't be together.It got to the point where I was physically sick with emotion because one of the things I dreamed about was going to wedding boutiques and doing wedding stuff with my mom. Like that's what mom's usually do when their child is getting married. I also have distanced myself from really doing anything to plan for the wedding which my fiance understands but we are on a bit of a time crunch so we are a bit behind on things.I am to the point where I am currently ignoring calls/texts from my mom because I don't want to hear her thoughts about the wedding. I have also decided to tell her that if she doesn’t want to support my fiance and I getting married and will just keep commenting on it that she will be uninvited from the wedding and I don't really want her to be apart of my life anymore.AITA for deciding to tell my mom this?Edit: I forgot to add that I don't have a very strong relationship with my mom because she doesn't understand that I'm non-binary and that I don't like guys.Edit 2: I read a lot of comments about concern for marrying young and that a parent should be worried about their child marrying young. I guess part of my family (my dad's side, including myself) is used to it because a lot of the family married young on that side. I did ask my dad what he thought about it and he said as long as we have the money to pay for wedding costs go for it but if we don't then we should wait.

In the summer, she closed on her house and started working on it. Obviously she hired professionals when she needed certain things done, but she decided to tackle the living room, herself.The way it turned out was a little off objectively. The main problem was that she bought this giant electric fireplace. They are very inefficient heaters, and the flames do not look real at all. And she said she spent $1,200 on it. (Also, they go for like $300 on Amazon last I checked.) She also put a super cheap TV on top of it. The viewing angles were some of the worst I have ever seen in a modern TV. The colors looked off unless you stood up and right in front of it. I belong to a community that discusses placement of TVs, so this is kind of important to me as somebody who wants to be an interior designer or technician one day.When my sister showed me her living room, I said, \"The TV seems a little high. You should be able to view it straight on instead of looking up.\" She said, \"I mean, I like to recline or lay on the couch when I watch TV. It seems fine to me. It keeps my kids out of the way, too.\" I sat down on the couch and showed her the proper way of viewing a TV, and she said, \"Dude. Nobody watches TV like that.

I pulled out my phone and showed her the community I read, and she said I could have the \"stupid app\" yell at her TV placement all she wants, but this is still her living room at the end of the day. She said that if it bothers me that much, we can just meet up for Burger King next time. I told her I was just trying to help, and she said, \"I literally never asked for your help.\" I told her she should not show people her living room if she does not want people to talk about her living room, and she implied I lack social skills and said I need to get out more and make IRL friends (no thanks).

She has a son from a previous marriage, Max (11) who suffers from autism. He's verbal but struggles a lot with socialising and interacting with people. My daughter is one of the few people that he feels comfortable around.My daughter (Kayla) is 16 now. She does well at school and hopes to go to university one day to study nursing. However we've had to deal with the usual problems like being reluctant to do chores, not tidying up her room, inviting boys over etc. Nothing too egregious but we've had our differences over the yearsMy daughter has been looking forward to a Muse concert for months. (We live in the UK and she's always been a huge fan.) I was hesitant at first, but she assured me that she'd be going with a group of close friends. I explained that she'd have to find the money herself, so she did odd jobs and saved her pocket money until she could afford the tickets.On the day of the concert my wife found out that her cousin suffered a bad car crash. She'd broken her leg, several ribs and needed to be hospitalised. They're practically like sisters so I agreed to take my wife and stay with her for support.Only problem is that we obviously couldn't leave Max by himself. We're not completely comfortable getting a babysitter because he's uneasy around strangers and has a number of special needs to consider.We hoped she'd understand, but she flew off the handle and told us how she had saved her money and waited months for this concert, which I totally get, but sometimes doesn't pan out the way you expect.My wife sat her down and calmly, but firmly said that she was nearly an adult now and needed to start being more responsible. She explained that Max needed to rely on his big-sister, and if she was ever going to get a career in nursing she'd need to be more mature. I thought it was little uncalled for but couldn't really disagree. Kayla snapped back and said she wasn't her real mom and it wasn't her businessEither way my daughter reluctantly ended up staying at home. Now she shuts herself inside her bedroom and refuses to speak to us. We explained that she can go next year and even offered to refund the ticket, but she keeps talking about how she'd been waiting for months and now her friends are going to be pissed with her. I said I was disappointed with her attitudeI feel bad for making her miss the concert, but at the same time I don't think my wife was wrong in what she said. I'm proud of my daughter but I think it's also time she started taking on more responsibility.AITI?",

When he gets overwhelmed I let him come to me wherever I'm at and I just hold him for a while until he feels better. Well, the other day my older son (15M) came up to me and asked if I could do the same thing for him. I could see he'd been having a bad day but my son is this 6 foot 3 rail, he looks like a grown man already. I explained that I can't “baby” him the way I do my younger son, my younger son has a legitimate anxiety disorder whereas my older son is just you know, having a bad day as all people do. But I also said I'd be willing to talk with him and support him in a more age-appropriate way.He looked embarrassed and said he'd rather not talk about it, and that he wished he could be his brother for a day. I'm like, you wish you could have his severe anxiety? No you don't. He went upstairs and has been giving me the cold shoulder since.AITA for not... treating him like a baby?

We have one child already, and I'm 20 weeks pregnant with a second. My husband has been very supportive of this, and because he is quite well off, I can take as much time off of work as possible.The reason for this post is the fact that while growing our family is great and all that, one of the main obstacles right now is the car my husband has.  It's big I guess, but it's only 5 seats. I was thinking that by the time our second kids come, we could have a 7-8 seater car. The size hike would be convenient for us in my opinion. I talked to my husband about it, but he's not exactly on board with the idea. He thinks his current car is big enough for 4 or even 5 people. I can see why he might not want to trade in, given that he's only had for 3-4 ish years, and he only paid it off about a year ago, but I proposed the idea of just trading in. With the car that he has, buying any full size SUV will go for about 15,000-25,000 after the trade-in value.The discussion turned into more of an argument, and one thing led to another to the point where I said that he doesn't seem to care about me or my future kids wellbeing and I left.

He stated that it was just kind of creepy that his uncle (my Dad) married someone who was so young.I flipped out and called him a \"honky bastard\", asking him to shut the fuck up or that it would not be good for him. He protested by saying that it was just his opinion. He said that even if I get offended, the fact remains that it is creepy anyway.

It's as if she has no concept of time at all and just estimates while she's fixing me meals. I would cook, but I work long hours and am rarely home before 8 PM.Well, last night, she screwed up royally. On Saturday, I had purchased expensive cuts of steak and taught her how to operate our grill. I made her demonstrate to me how to turn it on and off, where all the tools were, etc. I was pretty confident that this would be an easy enough task, but she was determined to prove me wrong. As I pulled in the driveway, I noticed black scotch marks on the front of my house, and some of the vinyl siding had begun to melt. The grill was still there, and fortunately my wife had turned it off, but I was still furious.I stormed into the house and demanded to know what happened. My wife came up with a stupid excuse of not thinking the steaks were cooking, which then caused her to turn up the heat. She then explained that the grease from the steaks had started a fire and she got the assistance of a neighbor to put it out. Needless to say, I was mortified. I couldn't believe that she dragged our neighbor into this and embarrassed us with this little stunt, but then I caught a glimpse of the steaks. They were like charred, shriveled hockey pucks. I could tell just by looking at them that they were inedible.I told my wife that she might as well just throw the steaks away, since she couldn't be bothered to cook them properly. She got extremely defensive when I said this, as if it was my fault that she destroyed our dinner and melted the side of our house. I told her \"Let's get one thing straight. This is ALL on you.\" I admit that I raised my voice, but she 100% deserved it. This caused her to cry and quickly excuse herself to the bathroom. Now I'll have to waste time and money this weekend replacing siding when I had planned to go over to a friend's house to watch football.

	"body" : "Hello AITA community, I'm in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some outside perspective. My fiancé and I usually don't have major disagreements, but this incident has left us both upset and I'm not sure if I was in the wrong.For as long as I've known him, my fiancé has had this pair of boots. They're old, really old. He's had them for ages and wears them everywhere – and I mean everywhere, from hiking trails to formal events. I've always found it a bit odd, especially at events where everyone else is dressed up or at least shows some kind of thoughtfulness to their appearance. He insists that they're high-quality boots, the kind that can be rebuilt over and over, and he's quite attached to them. He often talks about how much money he spent on them years ago and how they're meant to look aged and rugged.The thing is, to me, they just look... terrible. They're scuffed, discolored, and honestly a bit embarrassing in certain settings. So, I made a decision that I thought would be a nice surprise. I threw out the old boots and bought him a new pair, a sleek and stylish one that I thought would be more appropriate for a range of occasions. Mind you, he's only mentioned this once about the quality and how he can essentially re-use them or something like that. But he's also very frugal so I thought he just felt guilty spending which is why I decided to just step in and help him out.Well, the surprise didn't go as planned. When he found out, he was livid. He said that those old boots were special to him, that they looked as they should, etc. He accused me of not understanding the worth of well-made, lasting items. He's also quite upset about the new boots I bought, calling them \"cheap looking mall boots\" and saying they're nowhere near the quality of his old ones. I also accused him of not reading the room and noticing when his shoes are CLEARLY not appropriate and standout in the worst way possible.I feel terrible. I genuinely thought I was doing something nice for him, updating his wardrobe a bit and saving him the embarrassment of wearing those rugged old boots to nice places. But now I wonder if I've completely disregarded his feelings and attachment to those boots.So, AITA here? Was I wrong to throw away his old crusty boots and replace them with something I thought was better? I thought I was being thoughtful, but his reaction has made me doubt my actions.EDIT: It's clear the consensus is IATA. I spoke to my fiance again it is only now that he told me they were a pair of boots that were custom made to his feet sizing. I looked up the company and the prices are so absurd I almost cried. I asked him why he never ever brought up that he had a custom pair of boots! I imagine no one has something like that or at least very few people that it's something worth mentioning! I just have to admit I was wrong and that's it, I cannot even come close to affording a new pair of those same boots for him.",

I’m currently living with my mother(56f). We’ve been having to hire a cleaner to clean around the house and my mom is tired of spending the money. She can’t do much around the house because of some chronic pain, idk, so she’s been asking me to ‘pick up the slack’.I told her I never asked to be brought into this world and pretty much blew up on her. We normally get into fights but it felt different this time which is why i’m posting. She told me she’s tired of always cleaning up after my messes and called me a bunch of mean things.I honestly need to get on AISH and move out but it takes a long time to get put on it in case anyone is asking.Anyways, should I help my mom around the house more?I think i’m right to think that because of all of my conditions literally making it 100x harder for me to preform a simple task then anybody else, i shouldn’t be burdened with all of the house labour.I could also be an asshole though because I do rely on her so much, and I feel like maybe I should try my best to help out more and take the pressure off of her back, she is a single mom after all.AITA?EDIT: this got a lot of backlash, im sorry and i’m trying my best right now i promise. there’s a lot of things i’m reflecting on today, thanks for the judgement.EDIT TWO: (April 10th 2023 at 4:56PM PDT)alright so i read a lot of replies and while harsh i needed it, i’ll stay away from dating until i better myself and i’m trying to do better at home. i’m in vancouver and housing is expensive so i’m gonna have to work around that if i plan to move out. the homeless shelters here have a notoriously bad reputation so i hope it doesn’t come to that. i didn’t want a girlfriend to mooch off of solely, i just meant if i found a girlfriend and we moved in together we could pay rent together. and as for my other posts about my addiction, i probably should’ve mentioned that here but didn’t see that it was relevant information for this post. to everybody saying i should use my drug money to pay for a cleaner, i couch hop when i’m not at home and use what the people around me offer. i have a very messy history with money, and have done some not so great things to get it. i owe a couple different people a few hundred bucks each too, whom i’m actively avoiding. life is so messy. anyways, others are recommending i get treatment, i’ve taken medication before but nothing that either worked or i didn’t abuse",

They are not, however, taking my other granddaughter (3), Hensley.My DIL has always been cold to me and my side of the family. No fights have ever taken place, I’ve always gone out of my way to be nice to her because it’s who my son decided to love, but she just never comes around. Never has really. In the beginning I asked my son if we’d done something wrong but he’d just say “she’s shy”. There was never any other explanation and I just stopped asking eventually.Well it seems her coldness towards us isn’t changing anytime soon but now that it’s effecting Hensley I’m pissed. There’s really no reason that she needs to exclude her from this trip or any trips. They aren’t hurting for money to take her — she’s a nurse and he has a good paying job too. And DIL’s side of the family is going (mom and sisters) and splitting the expenses of the trip which only means that they have even more money to spare to buy little Hensley park tickets.I tried to be more understanding when Hensley was a baby and hard to travel with. They go on an annual beach trip each summer and have never once offered to bring her. But now she’s getting older and hearing Lila talk about all of these fun things and not understanding why she can’t also go to Disney world. I finally lost it on my son about my growing distaste for his wife and her treatment towards Hensley. I’ve but my tongue for years but it’s not fair to her. I also told him that he’s a sorry excuse for a man to let anyone exclude their own blood the way that they do. I’m at my wits end and I told him if things don’t change with Hensley I would be confronting his wife. He got mad and claims it’s not their responsibility to take Hensley to these places but that’s selfish because he knows Hensley can’t go without them. I would love to take her to Disney or the Beach myself but I don’t have any money to put towards a vacation right now and neither does her mother, my daughter, and her dad doesn’t help out at all. I don’t understand how my son doesn’t have more compassion for his niece who is as sweet as can be. AITA for feeling this way?ETA: I know my son and his wife don’t actually “owe” Hensley anything but she’s their family. My son knows how much his sister and Hensley need him. Her father is in jail, he’s the only true male role model in her life. He means so much to her and she doesn’t understand why / is so sad that she can’t go to these places with him. We’re thankful for all that he does for her but it just is painful knowing they’re excluding her from things she’ll never get to do otherwise when it wouldn’t be no burden on them to take her.",

	"body" : "We are first time parents to a 5 month old baby girl. Ever since she was born I have proactively taken many lovely pics of my husband & our daughter playing together while he never had the sense to do it...so much so that I have less than 10 pics with my daughter in the first month of her life while he must have more than a 100. He also constantly asks me to take a pic with her every time he is holding her while I don't have anyone to ask to take a pic since when I am playing with my daughter, he is working. All of this has led to a huge imbalance in the number of pics he has with her vs what I have with her. Somehow while being the mom and doing all the mom admin, i always forget to click a pic with her and he never takes one proactively. However he always remembers to proactively either take a selfie with her or ask me to take a pic of them both. So he has a pic with her during all her significant firsts while I don't. I have also taken so many videos of them playing together and compiled them all together in a beautiful video which I gifted to him on father's day. I have been gifted no such videos nor had any proactive clip been shot of me with her. Today we took our daughter for the first time into london using the train. This was her first time using any form of public transport. This was a huge deal for me and I kept telling it to him. My husband dropped me and we went to the platform while he went to park his car. As soon as he came, he asked me to take a photo of the two of them. By the time I took the photo, the train had come but we still had a few seconds so I asked him to quickly take one of me with her before the doors open. He clicked one rushed photo and was like train is here..let's go. Later when I check the photo, it is all a blurred mess while his photo is so perfect (the one I took). I lost my shit & had an argument with him as to why he couldn't take a nice photo. He seemed to think I am making a huge deal for no reason and told me that he will take a pic as soon as we got off the train. I tried explaining to him that I wanted a picture of the moment before she first takes the train and he thought it's no big deal. It turned into a fight bcoz I was so mad at him for doing a shit and hurried job with my photo when I took such a nice photo of him and on top of that he didn't understand why I was so pissed. So I told him that since I now don't have a nice photo with her of this moment, and since according to him it's not a big deal and we can take a photo after we got off the train, I am deleting the picture I have of him with her so that neither of us have a photo of that moment. He thought I was crazy and I went ahead and deleted the photo. Since then he has accused me of being immature and childish.AITA for deleting that pic?Edit - added some context in comments",

This involves a family friend “Delia.” My mom lives out of state.For Christmas, I asked Delia if she could get me a vacuum since our old one was natty and disgusting. I sent her the link to the one I wanted. She curtly told me no because she already had my gifts picked out. I asked her if she could buy the vacuum as a gift for my dad instead then, since a new vacuum would be perfect for our house.She became even ruder and said she was not giving my dad a vacuum for Christmas and had his gift already. She got heated, I stayed polite. I was pretty upset at the rude responses but fair enough- I bought my dad the vacuum myself as a gift.When we opened our gifts. Delia had gotten me a bunch of stuff from some holy sites she went to on a trip abroad (I’m Catholic) and some headphones. It wasn’t exactly what I’d wanted, but it was nice. I thanked her.I gave Dad the vacuum and he obviously liked it.  Delia gave Dad some custom pins. He oohed and ahhed more than he did for my gift. I’m his fucking daughter.The big issue was over one small item Delia gave me- a rosary from a holy site in Europe. I already have 2 other rosaries. I thanked her but advised her I planned to give it away as I already have too many rosaries. I asked her permission to give it to my mom instead.She said it was my gift and I could do whatever I wished, but that maybe I should get my mom a different one since this one was for me. To be polite, I smiled and told her I’d look into it, but that I really wanted to give this one to my mom since I already have more. She shrugged and said okay.After Christmas, my dad found out about the vacuum and rosary and blew up pretty badly. Delia made a dramatic proclamation that she’s “tired of [my] rudeness around gifts” and doesn’t want to give me any more. I think maybe I could’ve handled it better, but Delia knew what I wanted, could afford it, and instead got me something I didn’t need. People regift all the time, and I was gracious enough to ask her permission.So AITA for this?EDIT: I get it guys, I suck. I’m the biggest asshole that ever assholed.

	"body" : "1, 26F, just got married to the love of my life, 32M, in december. He proposed in summer 2022 but we decided to hold off on the wedding due to some personal reasons. I have never gotten along with my SIL, 25F, she is always trying to put me down and is overall not the kindest. I met my husband through her when I was 20 and she's been kind of distant since then. While her and I were friends I shared a lot about my insecurities. I used to be 300 pounds and was very insecure about it. I went on a weight loss journey but she always felt the need to compete with me but she wasn't able to lose the weight. If I worked out for an hour she had worked out for 2 or, if I chose something healthy on the menu she would laugh at me. Despite us drifting this hasn't really gone away. I have lost some weight and am at a healthy weight now. It's important to note I only lost weight for health reasons and not appearance reasons, despite this, I think losing weight has made men more attracted to me(not that this is important). I am now thinner than her, she is chubby but not fat like I was.Of course she was at my wedding, she was a bridesmaid and her and I were actually getting along well and there were few issues. She was actually super supportive during the whole process. The ceremony was gorgeous and I wouldn't hesitate to call it the best day of my life. During the reception the cake came out and everyone was having it and I noticed that she wasn't. I could see her eyeing me as I ate cake. I had 2 slices and by the time I was on my second slice I could feel her eyes. I felt like she was judging me for eating cake after my weight loss. I think she is jealous because I was able to lose weight and she wasn't. I was tipsy and decided to confront her. I asked her what her problem was and why she isn't eating the cake. She seemed offended but didn't say anything. This upset me more and I lost it, I told her she thinks she's a good person when she's really not. I also accused her of being in love with my husband. She left in tears and the rest of the night was tainted from the interaction. My maid of honor texted me and told me I way overreacted and some other guests shared her sentiment. I haven't apologized but have been thinking about it since my MIL cut off me and my husband. My husband agrees she's probably in love with him and I should just leave it alone. AITA?EDIT: I want to give more context on our friendship. When I was bigger than her she would make remarks about me being the cow of the friend group. When I started my weight loss she made fun of me for it. Now that I am thinner than her I think she’s jealous that I’m able to eat cake now.",

The expectation is that Jack will get into a better college than Peter.As a reward for being an excellent student all these years, my wife and I have decided to prioritize Jack's education over Peter's.We have two separate accounts with equal amounts of money that we've saved over time for each of them to help with college expenses. They still have access to this money.However, we've decided that when we contribute additional funds, our priority will be to pay for the best possible college for Jack, while whatever remains in our budget will go towards Peter's education.When we discussed this with them, Peter was furious. He argued that we've seen how hard he's worked all these years, that he has as much money as Jack, and that it's unfair to penalize him just because Jack is naturally smarter.INFO: Both want to go to Law School in future.INFO2: Peter has enough money in the saving account to probably cover most of the colleges in the country. The issue is that if both of them go to extremely expensive schools, then the extra amount I can contribute won't be divided equally.INFO3: We have a policy of no loans and we don't want them to work during college. That's why both of them have a substantial amount of money saved up. If Peter wants to work or take out loans, that will be his responsibility.",

She considered going back home to Davao City or staying a dorm like room in Manila searching for a new job. We priced things out.Then she stopped complaining this week. She said everything was okay. On Friday, she sends me a pics of her and a female bartender smiling and having fun. She followed that up with a video of about 30 shirtless men dancing on and around a stage. A second video showed her and the bartender dancing having fun.I asked where she was and she said that the owner decided to cater to single filipino women instead of Japanese business men and they were getting prepared for the grand opening.I told her I was upset that she didn't tell me this until now. I said what about you quitting. She said she didn't want to now. I asked if she was still being harassed by the owner's wife and she said yes, but it was okay now.So last night, I told her I wanted her to quit still because she was still being mistreated by the wife. She said it would cost (literally) 10x the cost to support her than what we had already discussed and researched. Which got me mad, because she was clearly lying. So I told her let's video chat.

During that time, I got a degree in nutrition and have been working for a local grocery store chain as a dietician. I'm keenly aware of what makes a healthy lifestyle because I stay current on nutrition research, and I even write diet and exercise tips for the store's customers. Rachael has gained a bit of weight over the last ten years, but that's understandable and natural, particularly because of her Hispanic ancestry. However, her mother (we'll call her Margaret) has really ballooned, and it's starting to put a strain on my marriage.Margaret was never thin, but she at least seemed to make an effort to eat fruits and vegetables and have smallish portions, until about two years ago. During the pandemic, Margaret lost some close friends, and it led to her barely leaving home out of fear. She also ate a lot. Rachael and I suspect that stress played a role, but as a grown woman, Margaret needed to recognize that she needed help. After she got vaccinated, Margaret was more willing to go out and do things again, but she has continued to eat a tremendous amount of food and food that isn't at all healthy.Recently, the three of us were out to dinner, and Rachael and I ordered entree salads. I also ordered a Coke Zero, which I know isn't a great option, but it has no calories, and I don't drink soda that often. However, Margaret ordered a burger and fries with a regular Dr. Pepper. Rachael and I were planning to tell Margaret that we intended to try to get pregnant soon, and this dinner was supposed to be a happy occasion, but I couldn't help but wonder how much longer Margaret would live if she kept up her bad dietary habits. Several of Rachael's aunts already have diabetes, so it clearly runs in the family.When the food came, I told Margaret this, and she seemed to get very offended, ignoring her risk factors, even though I laid them all out for her. I told her that perhaps she should seek counseling, but that, nutritionally-speaking, her diet would lead to an early grave. Relationships are not my area of expertise, and I wouldn't want to overstep. Margaret sulked and pouted for the rest of the evening, which was I thought was very childish, and Rachael kept trying to change topics, but I wanted an apology from Margaret because her doubting my credentials really felt like a slap in the face.A few days later, Rachael said that Margaret called her and told her that I had been a huge jerk, but all I wanted to do was help.

I told her there was no next time, what are the odds of me getting in then if I didn't now. She told me some bs about getting experience, generic stuff.Then she told me this story. Apparently she had always wanted to be a doctor as a kid, and even though her father didn't accept women in university, she still wanted to go ahead with it. She said she did super well in school, but in those days all students in the province took exams at the same time and they were worth your entire mark.Anyway, she had her period and apparently had really bad cramps or felt sick or something and her doctor wouldn't give her a note bc it was due to her period. She barely passed her exams and had her acceptance revoked. She applied to physio school the next cycle (pun not intended hahaha) and didn't get in either. She went to the university office and sat there until the guy apparently gave in and so she became a physiotherapist.Anyway, I told her that she didn't not get into medical school because of period cramps, and she didn't even take her own advice and reapply to medical school! It sounded like she was just trying to make me think about all ways she succeeded and I didn't so I got mad and hung up the phone.I don't think I'm the asshole because I was already in a bad mood and her bragging about her accomplishments was obviously not going to help my situation.EDIT: I'm not a misogynist, and I do understand how bad period cramps can be.

She let me know that when she was very young (starting at the age of 11), she started hanging out with the wrong crowd. She got into legal trouble for non-trivial stuff. With all that said, the stuff she did was not evil, irredeemable stuff; they were just bad decisions and mistakes. She let me know that she is considered fully rehabilitated by the government, which is good. She made me swear that I would never tell anybody about her past, and that she’s opening up to me because I love her.

CC works abroad now, and he’ll probably never meet MH, so I thought it was safe. So far there is absolutely no reason to believe that CC spread the word even further.

So, let me provide some context first.My friend and I have known each other for years, and we're really close. We often engage in playful pranks and sometimes help each other out in unique ways. One thing I've developed a skill for over time is waxing. I've waxed a few friends before, and it has always been fun experience for both parties involved.Recently my friend mentioned how he wanted to get rid of some body hair jokingly complaining about how it was getting out of control. He didn't think I'd take it seriously but I thought it would be a fun opportunity to surprise him and help him out simultaneously.A few days ago, when he was at my place, I decided to go all out and wax his entire body. He laughed throughout the process and it seemed like he was enjoying the experience at first but I was so giddy by the time we finished his back that I playfully waxed his eyebrows off. He didn’t explicitly tell me to stop or anything and we were just having so much fun but afterward he's been pretty upset and distant. A few days later I asked him about it and he’s saying he feels uncomfortable and that I crossed a boundary.Now here's where I'm confused. In the past, I've waxed some of my other friends, and it was all in good fun. They loved it and even asked for repeat sessions. I honestly didn't expect this reaction from my current friend, considering our history of playful camaraderie.But I can see now that I might have overstepped this time. I didn't think he'd react negatively and I feel terrible for making him feel uncomfortable. However, I want to emphasize that my intentions were never malicious; I genuinely thought we were just having some lighthearted fun.So, Reddit, am I the asshole for waxing my friend completely, including his eyebrows, without his explicit consent even though I thought we were just playing around? I'm open to your judgments and willing to make amends if needed.TL;DR: I waxed my male friend's entire body, including his eyebrows, without realizing he'd be upset as we've engaged in similar playful interactions before.

I buy lots of makeup, water, skincare, and I exercise and eat well a lot. I get a good amount of attention from guys especially at prom for the past 4 years and I plan to work in the beauty industry.I have an annoying little sister, Laura (14F) who wants to be just like me. I hate this because Laura should just be herself, but she always wanted to be me. She kept trying on my clothes and using my makeup ever since she was a little girl. She even told me a year ago that she wanted to be just like me. The thing is that Laura doesn’t have any good fashion sense, she doesn’t take care of her skin, and she’s kind of overweight (5’1 and 150 lbs last I checked).I told her that if she wanted to be like me, she has to exercise and eat right, and to stop eating McDonald’s frequently like she always does, and to actually know color theory. I told her to try and dye her hair blonde, but then I said I know she isn’t going to do these things because she’s nothing like me and never will be. I thought that would make her back off, but she ended up getting really sad and she ran to my mom and kept asking why she didn’t let her be like me.Now our mother is pissed and thinks I’m trying to turn my sister into a spoiled brat and she thinks I have an obsession of feeling superior to her. I don’t. She’s a dorky 14 year old, I have no reason to try and put her down in a malicious manner.Was I an asshole here? My friends are saying that I was too mean. My mom is furious. Our dad is the only one on our side and wants Laura to lose some weight too.Edit: Fine, I’m the asshole here. I’ll apologize to her and not bother her again.

She went and studied medicine while he joined the army.John finished his time in the army around the time their first daughter was born. Because he was unemployed while Katie was working, he stayed home with the baby while she went straight back.Fast forward a few years, and Katie is now a senior surgeon and head of her department. They've had a little boy and another little girl, and John still hasn't gone back to work, because Katie makes more than enough for the family.I'll be honest, I don't approve of this. I'm a SAHM to my two kids, and while I don't think all women should be, I feel happiest being a mum and don't think I'd enjoy anything else. My husband loves providing for us and I love taking care of them all. I don't really care about \"gender roles\" but I can't help but think John is taking advantage of her. He's a very fit and able-bodied man and learned lots of skills in the army according to Katie, so there's no reason for him not to be working rather than putting all the financial burden on her.I don't have much respect for a man who lets a woman who has just given birth go straight back to a complex and physically/mentally demanding job, as though her body hadn't already been through a lot. He could've just gotten a job for a few months and let her have some maternity leave so she could bond with her babies.We live quite close to them and our kids go to the same school. My kids have started asking why Uncle John doesn't go to work like their dad. I had to explain that different people have different lifestyles and we have to be kind and accept it. But I did tell them that this isn't right, and that a father should provide and protect his family like their dad does.They also asked why John has painted nails (he lets their daughters put makeup on him and paint his nails). I don't have a problem with this, but I recognize society does, so I said he and the girls were just \"being silly\".Unfortunately this got back to their cousins, who told Katie, who phoned me up shouting at me, demanding I \"keep my nose out of their business\" and saying her children wouldn't be playing with mine anymore.I'll admit that I shouldn't have said anything to the kids, they're too young to understand.

	"title" : "AITA For Telling My Wife To Drink Less Sweet Tea?",
	"body" : "My (28M) wife (27F) Anna and I have been together for five years, married almost two. She’s from the deep south, while I’m from new england. We were long distance for a year, during which she visited me and fell in love with my home state. When we moved in together, we agreed to find a place here rather that where she’s from. It was a big change, but she’s told me since that she couldn’t be happier. There were definitely adjustments she had to make (mainly to the snow), but we’ve made a pretty happy life together. Of course, being from the south, there were traits she brought with her that reflect that. I’ve always found these little differences to be endearing, and she’s expressed the same about me, but one of those traits has posed a consistent issue.My wife loves tea. She’s tried various teas over the years, though she’s partial to black teas. When it’s cold out and she’s staying in for the day, or if she’s unwinding from a long/hard day (she works 10-hour shifts), she sometimes makes a hot cup of earl grey and chills on the couch. In the summer, though, she drinks a lot of iced sweet tea. She’ll make a half-gallon for maybe 5-6 days and use an entire cup of sugar. I’ve had a number of friends and family experience issues related to, or developing, diabetes, and it was a huge concern that was drilled into me growing up. I had little sugar in my childhood and don’t do treats/sweets very much, but my wife has a huge sweet tooth. I’ve expressed my concerns before, but she says she has no family history of diabetes and only three cavities, and that until a doctor tells her she has something to worry about, she isn’t going to worry.We ended up fighting the other day because I asked her after her third glass of sweet tea to have some ice water instead. She said she’d have some water in a minute. I reminded her of her soda issue (borderline addiction) as a teen, and how bad it got during quarantine, and how I was worried tea was becoming her new coca-cola. She snapped at me about how she’d spent 6:00am to 5:00pm in a hot kitchen and that she deserved to relax however she pleased. I told her that yes, that’s true, but that I’m just concerned about her health, especially since she’s made such good strides these past few years expanding her diet and nourishing herself properly. She called me an asshole and said we both need some time alone and apart to think this over. We’ve barely spoken since then, mostly over text, and it feels tense in the house when we’re both there together.I was just trying to communicate my worries about her health. Was I an asshole here?Edit: This is about my wife’s HEALTH, not her weight. I do not care about her sugar consumption leading to weight gain. Before we met she was underweight and suffering an ED. I’m glad she’s gained some weight over the time we’ve known each other.",

Mind you like i said she has 4 children and isnt the best mom. Which means sometimes the kids do annoying rowdy shit and no one does anything.after a long while of children screaming and not behaving well she comes and asks me if I can please watch them and make sure theyre good for the rest of the time.

She ended up moving across country for a promotion (her company wanted to keep her employed so they offered her a better job). She was happier but was having trouble with childcare and was working less hours. A couple months into her new job, she vented to me that her older workers were criticizing her constantly and she wasn't sure if she was doing things right or not. She dropped off the face of the earth and it wasn't until a few days later we found out she had a meltdown and was admitted to a psychward. Our mom drove down to check on her and help get her out of the facility(they wouldn't let her go) She quit thr company for good because the previous supervisor started spreading rumors about her meltdown and that her coworkers had cornered her and told her to quit because she was 'mentally uncapable.'

Lately, our family have been missing her son and asked her when is she bringing him down. (She didn't bring him for the graduation because he didnt like flying and she would be alone with him, i sent her videos on how to occupy a baby on a plane) she said when she gets job she'll start working on a visit and that her previous employer won't give her cashed out leave.

My mum asked Stella how Magda is and Stella started going on about how Magda is a neuroscientist now and living abroad and really bragging.I said that I was surprised as she was kind of chaotic at school (and I didn’t mention but she was a couple of classes below me too). Then Stella asked me what I and my brother are up to now and I said I work in an office and also said what my brother does.

I couldn’t hide my annoyance at that moment and I said that “it’s not really though, is it? Anyone can study and apply for that! (because it’s true). And Magda was right in the average class set at school so clearly anyone can do it!”My mum then told me that was ridiculous and the conversation kind of awkwardly shifted and continued for an awkward minute about other things before Stella said she needed to get going and left.When we got out of earshot I then had a go at my mum for talking to her in the first place. We’re not friends and I don’t think there was anything wrong with what I said. Stella just wanted to brag and my mum had no loyalty to me in talking to her in the first place.

I want to know if I'm in the wrong for confronting his sister about it during a recent family visit.Before my boyfriend's older sister moved out for college, she used to share a bed with him. They're 5 years apart, and this was a common occurrence in their household. My boyfriend had mentioned it offhandedly to me in some conversation, and had added that it was quite common in their culture.

I was told that you used to share a bed with your brother. Can you explain why?\"She seemed surprised by my question and slightly taken aback. She replied saying it was common in their culture, and also that there wasn't enough space anyways for separate bedrooms.I calmly pressed further, \"I understand the space issue, and  but it just seems strange to me. I mean, you both were well into your teenage years. Did you ever think it might be... you know, a bit inappropriate?\"My boyfriend's sister seemed quite offended at this point and kind of angrily replied, \"Absolutely not! We're siblings, and it was never anything more than that. We were just close, and there was nothing weird at all.\"I didn't want to come across as judgmental, but I couldn't help but share my thoughts, \"I'm sorry, but it's just difficult for me to wrap my head around it. I don't mean to offend you, but it makes me uncomfortable, and I needed to get it off my chest.\"The conversation didn't escalate further, but there was definitely some tension between us for the rest of the family function.

She has lived with me all through university, surrounded by many young adults, as well as when I took my hiatus from school. I struggle with documented mental health issues, and she is my certified emotional support animal (ESA) and not a pet. She is my one sigh of relief and functioning without her around is difficult.So after desperately cold calling leasing offices and agents I finally found a place that answered me and met some of my needs/ budget... and they had a single opening.

With school starting in a matter of days and me having no other options, I signed the lease. The leasing agents told me although this girl I would be living with is allergic to cats, I can still bring my cat because she is an ESA and I cannot be denied, but it's up to m- if I want to cause potential roommate issues. The suggested that maybe I don't bring her up right away and talk it out with them once I get to meet them all and live with them for a bit. My room is also on the smaller side and it would not be fair for her to be shut in there all day everyday.Upon moving in with these 4 other girls, I learned that I would be living with a dog. It was a different roommates animal, but it's a miniature poodle which is hypoallergenic. According to the roommate with the cat allergies, she is \"quite allergic\" and because of that her family also only has poodles. Here's the big issue now. My parents offered to watch and take care of my cat for me while I navigate this situation, and I am very thankful for that. However, my parents have 6 cats of their own.... And they absolutely do not get along with my cat. My parents, one being an ex veterinarian, have tried just about everything from calming collars to like Jackson Galaxy type stuff and it's just getting worse. I also think her and I being separated is causing her massive anxiety ad it's just not fair for her.TLDR: AITA for bringing my ESA cat into my apartment even though one of my roommates is allergic",

I didn’t pick up my phone because I was in the other line and instead, I declined her call. She then sent a text asking who I was with and I immediately hung up the phone, called her and told her not to ever text my phone disrespecting me like that. I raised my voice and told her that this was the second time she’d disrespected me and I told her to stop bullcrapping and to take time to reflect how she speaks to me and to stop questioning me.The time before this, she questioned me on why I was taking so long to get to her house after I said I’d be there an hour ago while my friends were in the car, so they heard everything she said while she was questioning me.Apparently, she felt disrespected and she told her mom as well as her brother and they’ve both been calling me since, accusing me of being abusive and demanding that I give her an apology. I understand where they might be coming from, however from my perspective I did nothing wrong to her other than asking to be respected and I told them I would not be apologizing.Aita?",

She said she have been working in kitchens for more than a decade.We were cleaning up and putting things away in the freezers after we closed the kitchen. I gave her a plastic container filled with meatballs and told her to put it 'on' the tall freezer, I immediately realized I should have said 'in' the tall freezer. But surely no one is that dumb to put it 'on' a 8 foot tall freezer. But yes, she managed to put it 'on' the 8 foot tall freezer.The top 10 inches of the freezer is just the control panel so in the back there's 10 inches of empty space with no covering on the sides and the back. So the container with 150+ meatballs fell 10 inches onto the freezer from the front panel and all the meatballs just rolled down from top of the freezer onto the dirty kitchen floor. She started screaming omg omg, I said I should have told her to put 'in' the freezer. She kept saying sorry and sorry, she was picking up the meatballs from the floor and I also started picking them up and I was holding in laughters.Then two people who were doing the dishes in the next room heard us and came to ask what happened, they started laughing which caused me to also start laughing. She just kept saying sorry and covering her face with her hands, then I kept saying through laughters that it was mostly my fault and not hers. We kept laughing for like a good two minutes.Then two waiters from the front came in, they also started laughing after learning what had happened. One of them grabbed a stool and got on it to reach for the container that's at the back of the control panel of the freezer, he started laughing again while his body was pressed against the freezer so the freezer started to shake, then one of the waiter shouted \"stop laughing, the freezer is shaking!\" Then we all started laughing even more, at that point the new girl have left the room.So the next day she didn't show, and our boss told us that she have quit.I feel so bad for her, if that happened to me on my first day, I would never leave my room for like three months.

	"body" : "AITA? My husband and I have a blended family. He has three children ages 12F, 9F, 6M from a prior marriage and I have two children ages 7F and 6F. The children from our previous marriages we share 50/50 custody with their other parents. So every other week, we have five kids. When we got married we wanted to have another child together, and about 3 months into our marriage I got pregnant. My due date is now two weeks away. My oldest stepdaughter (12F) wants to play school basketball and volleyball. She goes to school where her mother lives which is about a 30 minute drive (one way) from our house. So on normal days, that’s about an hour and fifteen minutes of driving in the mornings (his three kids go to two separate schools, the oldest is in middle, while the younger two are in elementary), then another hour and fifteen to pick up. So in total without sports we are spending 2.5 hours in the car every other week. If my step daughter does sports that will add another 2-2.5 hours in the car on practice days because you aren’t allowed in the school to watch them practice, there aren’t any close places for us to wait, and we don’t live close enough to drive home so we spent that time last year sitting in the car. Everyday is either a practice or a game day. So that would mean being in a car for at minimum 4.5 hours per day. So the very very soonest my husband would get home is 5:30 (sometimes closer to 8 or later if it’s a game night). Basketball and volleyball season (combined) will run around 6 months. We have no family close by, the closest family is four hours away. So since my stepdaughter wants to play sports at school every other week (when we have the kids) I will be the only person taking care of the household chores, our newborn baby, and my two children. All the stress will fall on me every other week. Not to mention I feel it is highly unfair as she is the only one that will be able to participate in any extracurricular activities since hers are so time demanding. I suggested her possibly doing basketball and volleyball at our local gym that offers those leagues as they only have practices and games maybe 2-3 times a week rather then everyday, but was told it was unfair to her to not let her participate in her school sports. However I feel it’s unfair that he is going to miss a lot of time with our newborn so 1 out of 6 kids can play a sport.

They were funny and awesome, just like my girlfriend. I didn't question in then.Then we went to a potluck with her friends and one  is in a wheelchair and another is so short they almost look like a child, like under 5 feet tall. Okay, still fine.Last week I met one of her co-workers she is befriending for brunch and also my girlfriend's brother came. I didn't know her brother only had one leg and wears a fake leg. Her coworker is trans, in early stages of transitioning.How does this fantastic amd thriving woman seem to only have friends who have struggles? I asked her if she has any friends that aren't disabled and she said, sure she does, so I just pointed out that I've never met them yet. She was a little irritated with me so I didn't go into too much detail about my observation so far. I did suggest that maybe she has low self esteem so forms relationships with people who are worse off than her so she can feel better about herself and talked about trying therapy. She didn't respond to me any more since that conversation except to call me a \"jerkface\" and it's been almost six days with only rare text responses from her that are mostly one word only.I think it was a valid point to bring up. She admitted to me she takes anxiety meds so I thought maybe she looks badly at herself and wanted to help lift her up. Her life is hard for me to understand but she won't talk me through it to help me understand and learn about it.I thought I was being supportive and nudging her towards support. But she felt differently. Was it really so bad what I did?Edit: Okay, I can see I was an AH by the votes. I also feel I should have included some more info, like she asked her landlord if she can build a ramp just so she can hang out with her one wheelchair friend at home.

I didn't think too much about this, I figured that there was something wrong with the women's, or maybe she'd accidentally gone into the wrong toilet. I thought this was a one-off.I'm fairly regular however, and I might have to go about 2-3 times throughout the workday E's presence has become a semi-regular occurrence, as it seems we have more than 1 overlapping schedule. The next time I saw E was 2 days ago, she was standing at the sink again touching her hair in the mirror but I didn't hesitate this time, I walked in and started straight toward the urinal to do my business. I think I made her scared because she hurried out again with her head down and her arms over her chest.I felt bad since I'm a fairly large man at 6'1\" and they can't be bigger than 5'6\", I'm aware I can be intimidating, and don't want to make anyone feel like I'm a threat to them, especially a woman who's in the men's! She shouldn't even be in there in the first place, right?

She said that she was sorry, that our manager had told her that she had to use the men's, I said that was ridiculous, and wanted to know why she'd have to do that.E just stood there, looking at the ground, then let out a long sigh before just asking me to move out of the way of the exit, of course, I did I didn't realize I was blocking the exit. E looked up at me on the way out with tears welling up in her eyes and said quietly that she didn't have a gender certification.I talked to our manager about this situation and she confirmed to me that E is a male and was asked to use the men's or neutral(?) WC to make the other ladies and customers more comfortable until they legally changed their records. I told her about my discomfort sharing a toilet with E, but she told me there wasn't anything she could do until E got a GRC.To be honest, this news was very shocking to me as I fully believed they were a biological female from birth, but I guess I haven't really spent too much time around them outside our bathroom run-ins.Now I've got another shift coming up with E, and I'm worried about meeting them in the bathroom again, would I be the asshole if I asked them to use the other bathroom, or to go at a different time, or maybe to dress a bit less feminine if they're going to be using the mens'?",

And, it just kinda came up incredibly inconveniently…So my (M36) wife’s (F28) family (parents, sister, brother in law, and their newborn) stayed with us over the holidays. We switch off every year, and sometimes we even have both our family’s together which is awesome since everyone surprisingly has so much fun.This NYE, I will concede got a bit out of hand.

We’re both originally from Massachusetts, I moved to Maine for nursing school 7 years ago and he moved up here for work about 5 years ago, but we both always planned to move out of Maine eventually. In fact, I had told him when we first got together that I wanted to move within a year, I was just staying to get more experience for my career. Now, I’m working as a nurse with plans to go back to grad school next fall and he works as a superintendent of a golf course in the area. My lease is up in April and I don’t want to renew, I want to move out of Maine, closer to where I’m planning to go to grad school and I want him to come with me since he was also planning on leaving Maine in a couple years anyways. He wants that too but he also says he needs to stay for another golf season (at least until the end of next November) or else he’ll take a huge hit in his career progression. My issue with moving next November is that I’ve really grown to hate this area and so badly and I want to go explore a new city and start a new chapter of my life plus I don’t know if I could have my lease extended until then. We’ve talked about compromises like if he comes with me in April I’m willing to move to a place that he likes more and stay for longer or if I wait and move with his timeline in November he’s willing to go to a place I prefer. Moving separately and being long-distance for 6/7 months isn’t really an option for us. Another piece of this is that I have a cat and he has a dog and they’re not the best together. I got my cat a couple years ago after wanting one for a really long time, and I love him with all my heart. His dog technically belongs to the golf course and was originally bought to work as a “goose-dog” and he was tasked with taking care of her while he works for them. He’s grown to care about her and she’s pretty well behaved and everything but he didn’t specifically intend on having a dog and I’m not a huge dog person. Additionally, the animals don’t get along the best..his dog scares and stresses out my cat and I’m worried that if we lived together it would make my cat miserable and that would break my heart, plus I really don’t want to live with a dog. I’ve been thinking about saying yes to his compromise and staying longer with him to leave in November because I love him and want this to workout, but in exchange I don’t want to live with a dog or worry about the animals not getting along. Am I the asshole if I ask him not to bring the dog?TLDR: am I the asshole for not wanting my boyfriend to bring his work-dog when we move out of state in exchange for pushing back my timeline to be with him?",

I understand her circumstances are difficult, but ever since she began living with us she has been entitled, attention-seeking, and generally incapable of taking responsibility for her actions. I suspect this is less to do with the circumstances and more to do with how she was raised: my brother- and sister-in-law were “lax” parents, and she responds to even the slightest discipline by screaming and crying on the ground like a toddler. As she has been put in my care, I consider it my responsibility to put my foot down regarding these behaviors.This morning, she said that she was sick when I called her down for breakfast. She did not have a fever or any other signs of illness. I told her to go downstairs and eat because we had things to do today.When she finally came down, she refused to eat breakfast, saying she felt too sick. It has already occurred multiple times that she has not eaten at the table and then expected to be made or bought food when she was hungry later. I was absolutely not going to buy her fast food while we were out today, so I told her to sit down and eat the food I had prepared.She acted very dramatic while she ate, groaning and clutching her stomach like a cartoon character. When this didn’t get her sympathy, she threw up on the floor. She says she couldn’t help it, but I don’t believe that. If she was really sick, she could’ve gone to the bathroom. The fact that she threw up right on the carpet makes me think she was trying to make a scene.But regardless of her motivations, she made a mess, and in my house, people take responsibility for themselves. I told her she would be expected to clean the carpet, and to pay for a professional service if she was unable to do it adequately herself (she gets an allowance, so she has money). Her reaction? To start sobbing and screaming at me, and then to run up to her bedroom and slam the door. All because I asked her to clean the mess she made. She hasn’t left her room since.I think all of this reflects on the way her parents have been raising her. She seems to believe that putting on enough of a show will get her whatever she wants, and that crying will relieve her of basic responsibilities. I understand I’m not her parent, but I am her legal guardian for the moment. Spoiled, attention-seeking children grow into spoiled, attention-seeking adults, and I just can’t imagine letting this go and letting her think that this kind of behavior is acceptable.",

She apparently got scared midway when it started raining harder because the roads were “too blurry” and she didn’t “feel safe”. So she says she parked somewhere and waited until the rain calmed down and drove back when it wasn’t pouring. She got home 9:50! I was worried all night because she didn’t tell anyone where she was heading. I did not let her inside. I only opened the door to take my keys back and I told her she’ll either have to find somewhere else to stay or wait until my parents get back to let her inside. My parents got back at around 10:30 and saw her drenched. Now they’re mad at me for taking it too far even though I warned her about what would happen if she did that again. I also don’t believe her made up story about waiting until the rain calmed down because if she really was scared she would have called me.Edit: I was occasionally watching her while she was outside so wasn’t in danger or anything. Also, as soon as my parents come she started shivering and I never noticed her do this for the whole 40 minutes she was out there which just proves she was lying to make herself seem like the victim. I don’t know how you can trust someone who lies like that to be “independent”. Imagine what she could’ve gotten herself into. ALSO my parents are talking about me potentially having to move out over this??? I doubt they will follow through but is that not overkill??",

This really hurt our mom because she feels like her daughter is choosing someone else’s mom over her. We tried talking to my sister about this, but she acts like we are trying to make her wedding about us.Over the weekend is where tensions hit an all time high. My sister and her fiancé were having a bridal shower at, surprise, her future MIL’s house. We got there early to see the decorations. My mom made a comment about the shower decor, and my sister got mad. My sister told my mom to stop acting like a kid, and my mom got mad because she thought my sister was being disrespectful. I agree that my mom shouldn’t make any negative comments about their choice in decor, but my sister should also be more respectful. She could have pulled my mother to the side and talked to her instead of embarrassing her in front of everyone.My sister’s MIL got involved and told my mom to “respect your daughter.” That made my mother even more angry, and she said somethings she shouldn’t have said. My sister’s fiancé told my mom to leave, so we left.I sent my sister a text explaining our side of things, and told her that she needs to think about her family too. My sister called me and told me that we are not “the victim,” and it’s “out of line” for me to tell her to think about our family when we were the one’s who acted selfish.I understand that my mom’s behavior wasn’t okay, but it’s built up anger from being left out of everything. If my daughter didn’t include me in any wedding planning, I would be upset too. I don’t know if I’m being an asshole for defending my mom. I’ve seen her hurt by all of this too long, so maybe I’ve lost the ability to see my sister’s side.",

Romy has had some incidents at school recently and I have been called an a-hole for how I responded.At the beginning of the year, Romy ran for school president, she is a very smart girl and puts a lot of effort into her work and her extracurriculars, including theatre, Model UN, and film club, to name a few. Romy ran against a number of kids, and the winner was 6th grade boy, Brixton (11M). Brixton seems like a good kid from what I’ve heard from other parents, however, my daughter doesn’t like him, he’s on the basketball team and my daughter thinks he only won because he’s a “jock” and gave out custom basketballs with his campaign logo when running. I offered to buy my daughter merch, but she refused saying it was “unethical”, even though it was not banned by school rules.On Monday, I got a call from Romy’s school saying she had got in trouble for bullying another kid. I was horrified and went to the school to pick her up, she was suspended for 3 days. I punished her by taking away her phone for the duration of her suspension. The kid she bullied was a transgender boy, this boy is very close friends with Brixton. I told Romy that she needs to respect kids no matter their identity.Yesterday, I got a message on X/Twitter from Brixton’s mom. She said that Brixton tried to reach out to Romy and show her how “amazing” this boy was, and that he felt a responsibility as school president to make sure the school was accepting, she said Romy pushed him away and told him to “f**k off”. I said that I’d speak to her, but that Brixton was also inherently pushing her buttons by trying to speak to her as he knows Romy does not like him. She said that Romy should try to get over this grudge and I told her that she had the right to not like a kid or want to talk with them. It got more and more heated and eventually, she blocked me.After this, I posted to our school district’s community Facebook page to show how Brixton’s mom was overstepping her boundaries and that I worried Brixton would use his power to retaliate against kids he didn’t like, after getting some pushback for including Brixton in this, I edited the post to only focus on his mom.I didn’t want Romy to go to school today after this, so I took Romy on a girl’s day out. I wasn’t checking my phone during this, but now that we are back, I see that I have got multiple messages from other parents, saying that I should be ashamed of myself for “disrespecting” Brixton’s mom.

It is a very stressful job in an emotionally draining industry.  I also have 'side hustles' related to entrepreneurship.My wife is a stay at home mom and we have a 1 year old who thinks waking up after 6 am is for laggards.  My wife is an amazing mom who cooks, does groceries and most of the baby care and also gets up with the baby most mornings.We married late so well after the '7 days a week startup grind' phase of my career.  These days I usually go in to work for only 4x9-10 hour days per week (plus some weekends, plus some weeks I'm working 6-7 days but not often).  I also struggle to carve out time for the side hustles.  After work I help clean up a little, usually do the dishes after dinner and spend a little time with the baby.  However my 'me time' is essential to stress management so some days I'll just game or read in my office till midnight.  Then on days that I'm don't go into the office I need to sleep in as I've never been the sort to function on <6 hrs of sleep.  I spend at least 1-2 days most weeks with my wife and baby: going to pool, library, park etc.For added context we are definitely 'top 1%' income wise.  We live in a nice place, have a house keeper who does all the cleaning weekly and 20+ hours of nanny time with the option of having nanny stay the night once a month.The conflict comes from my wife feeling that we do not share our child care duties fairly.  Specifically she keeps bringing up how in 'normal couples' the man takes care of the kids 1 hr each day after work and 1 day out of every weekend, and she insists that it's unfair that she has to get up early with baby every day.  Note, she refuses the overnight nanny option (who will get up with baby) when offered because 'it's hard to relax with another person in the house' and refuses to let our baby spend nights with grandparents (which grandparents have offered). The only path to restful sleep is if I get up with baby. Also wife says she can't nap during day for... reasons.I've tried doing early morning 1, 2, even 3 days a week over the past year, but find it really messes up my days since I'm a night owl, so don't go to bed early and then have to function on 5 hrs of sleep.  Or miss my weekly sleep in/recharge.  Underperforming at work feels a lot like staring into the abyss since I'm the sole earner in our family and my businesses are my life and despite being relatively well established, they're definitely not too big to fail and I have a bit of residual anxiety from years of 'will I go bankrupt this month?'

The mom ran and picked her up and said “EMMA! Absolutely not, don’t do that again, that road is close and busy! I’m not mad I’m just scared!” And the girl looked sad and worried.I told the mom “Hey, what the hell dude? Relax, you could’ve just talked to her!” Because honestly, scooping her up is enough, she didn’t need to yell. The mom rolled her eyes and walked off to their car. My GF told me to knock it off and stop being nosy and in other people’s business. AITA?",

Sunday morning comes along and I have a change of heart and I go to get “my” bagel. It’s not there, so I ask wife and she said she had 3 yesterday (Saturday) so there are no more left. I said she could have been considerate and double checked with me before eating the last one. Then she got offended and stupid argument followed. I know I said I didn’t want it, but I didn’t even have a chance to change my mind on Sunday. And also 3 bagels in one day is kind of ridiculous…. AITA?EDIT: The comments talking about our relationship need to relax, we are in a great place. If anyone here has been with someone for a long time, you know that bickering happens from time to time.

I'm the only one allowed to download anything on to the new one, though, since I use it for work and don't want to end up with a computer virus. Because of this, my daughter (22f) was using the laptop to play a game while in my office.My office is where we keep the newer computer, but for some reason she decided she'd use my office while using the laptop. I saw her playing on her cellphone, while also using the computer. My husband, her father (63m) asked if she was using the computer and she said yes. I took issue with this, since she was playing on the phone while also playing a game. I expected her to tell her father that he can use the new computer and give up the office, since all he wanted was to watch a youtube video.I'm a southern woman and I hold southern values, but my daughter wasn't raised in the south, so we butt heads often. I told her that she was selfish and was hogging the office, and she tried to say my husband hadn't asked her to move, or to let him use the new computer. My husband chose to defend her because she ran to him when I raised my voice.She began to cry, as if on cue (she does this often when I confront her about anything) and I told her to stop, since her crying does not work on me anymore. She was being incoherent and rude, so I stopped talking to her and left the room. My husband scolded me, telling me I \"have a mean streak\" in me, and that I went too far, but he works outside the home, so he doesn't have to deal with our daughrer as often. He told me she's not \"wired to understand social things\" unless they are said clearly, as she supposedly has aspergers. I truly think she was being selfish and I just want her to understand that.

I woke up a bit late like at 12 P.M. I got a notification on my phone about my RING camera. I checked it and a pacakged had been delivered. I hadn’t ordered anything in a while so I wasn’t sure what it was. I went downstairs and I got the package and it was a box with the word WEVERSE scattered all over it. When I checked the address it seemed to be right. I, of course, have no idea what a WEVERSE is so I opened it up. I found 3 KPop albums inside. It had a cover of what I guess to be a sun, flames and the word “HEAT”. I opened up the album because it looked cool. It has a bunch of little cardboard posters? I don’t know what to call them. It had a CD, a photo, and now that I searched it up I know they’re called photocards.Fast-forward to yesterday. My friend came over, I hadn’t told her about my little surprise package. First thing she asked me was “Have you gotten any packages?” What a strange question. I answered no. I wanted to see where this would go. She got all nervous and she honestly looked like she was about to start crying. She told me that she had ordered some stuff and had it all sent to MY house. I blew up. What right did SHE have sending stuff to MY house. I was yelling at her about it. She of course said “So you got the mail?! Why didn’t you tell me?!” Was it MY responsibility to take care of HER package that she hadn’t been keeping track off. I wouldn’t have mind if she told me about it beforehand. I know that where she lives it’s very busy and there are many thieves around. But to just not tell me about this. For all I know there could’ve been a bomb in there.She told me I was bein illogical and that I was the thief for taking her package. She then proceeded to SEARCH my WHOLE house just to find the KPop albums. Once she found them she yelled at me some more and then stormed out and left. I mean, I see why she’s mad. In her eyes I basically just stole something that belonged to her. I just don’t think she had to wait to tell me. After, she texted me saying that she was gonna contact a lawyer and sue me for “stealing” a package that was on my doorstep. She said that if I just dropped it then it wouldn’t be as bad. She also told me that if I just told her that I got her package. Problem is, it didn’t have her name on it. She’s stopped messaging me at all. I don’t think I’m overreacting, in fact I think she is.

My gf didn't want to take care of Deliah, which is whatever and I cannot change that. So I'm basically a single dad. I love Deliah, she is my life. She means everything to me, and I'd give a life and take a life for my baby. That's how much I love her. She's my world.When i informed my mom & dad that i had a daughter and i introduced my baby girl to my parents. , my dad's first move was to run upstairs and barge in my room grab all my stuff and go to the door and throw it out on the ground, he then pointed outside and yelled, and snapped his finger \"GET OUT RIGHT NOW!\" my mom was crying telling my dad \"no let him stay let him stay, we finally have some good news, etc\" and my mom was happy about my daughter as the last few years in our family, was not good. So announcing a new family member on the way brought a smile to my mom.My dad put all my belongings outside, while I held Deliah on my shoulder. I grabbed my stuff and left. I then walked to my local motel holding Deliah and we stayed there for a few days, till i figured out what i need to do and everything. It was rough. I didn't have enough money, and I had a daughter but I knew that i have to give my baby girl a good life regardless. I called my best friend \"Deandre\" who then gave my number to \"John\" and a lady named \"Janice\" who runs a daycare at her house which was super cheap so i could drop deliah off before workJohn owns a small warehouse. He offered me a job for $14/hr and he hooked me up with one of his connections to offer me a small studio apartment for cheap. So the baby was taken care of at daycare, and i got a job. I worked daily, and using the money i had after taking care of Deliah, the bills, etc. I started saving it up and whatever i saved i started a business. I started an e-commerce arbitrage-based business which took a lot of work and months. A lot of time, and money was lost but i eventually succeeded and my life changed completely.

	"body" : "Mark (M28) is one of my (M29) closest friends. We were roommates in college and studied the same field. We also shared many interests, so logically, we became great friends. At some point in college, we became friends with Amber (F29). Not even a week after we met her, Mark decided that he was head over heels for her.Throughout college (and even after college), Mark asked Amber out regularly. Most times she would agree, but their relationship never really progressed beyond him taking her out to dinner or buying her gifts.Several of our friends and I told Mark multiple times that things would never go anywhere. But he always persisted that he didn’t mind that and that making Amber feel appreciated was all he cared about.Around the time we were 26, Amber got married (to Mark’s horror) and had a son (Ian, M2). Unfortunately, the relationship didn’t last much longer than 2 years. They ended up getting divorced back in January of this year.Since then, Mark has been helping out Amber a lot. He takes the Ian to doctor appointments, goes grocery shopping for Amber and Ian, buys the kid gifts on holidays, stays up with Ian when he’s ill, etc. During this time, he has also been taking Amber on dates regularly, but she has kept things from escalating further. I found out all of this a few days ago when Mark messaged me and our other friend Amir (M28), and told us all of this. (As an aside, Mark met another woman back in May, but they only texted for a few weeks. Mark broke things off because he thought it was making Amber feel jealous and uncomfortable).We met up to chat (at Mark's request), and Mark told us that he’s disillusioned and doesn't think he'll have anything with Amber and that she has essentially turned him into a “man-servant” in his words. He told us that he spent most of the last weekend buying furniture with Amber and then setting it up in her new apartment.He then told us that Amber’s going to be starting a new job soon and needs someone to pick up Ian from daycare, 3 days a week, for the next few weeks. He says that she basically implied that she wants him to do that, but he told us that he plans on rejecting her plan and then ghosting her.I told him that he probably should just pick up the kid and go along with Amber’s plan for two reasons. Firstly, with a new job and apartment it's already difficult enough with Amber being a single mother and second, Mark has already made Amber used to relying on him so much that pulling the plug seems needlessly harsh. He also is available during the pickup times.Amir then said that I was being dumb and that Mark had no obligation to continue helping Amber. Mark left shortly afterwards (Amber sent him a list of errands to run) and didn’t come to a decision. Once he left Amir told me that I was effectively guilt-tripping Mark by telling him he should continue to help Amber.I’m pretty conflicted about Amir's judgment.AITA?INFO: For everyone saying I should help Amber, I will not. This is non-negotiable.Also, I encouraged Mark back in May to start a new relationship, but he broke things because according to him, Amber was jealous.",

My friends, on the other hand, don't care about the way they say things as much as I do, so when I'm lacking context and I try to interpret the things they say as they're written because I didn't understand them, we usually end up arguing because they think I'm just being pedantic for not reading between the lines like my other friends do.So, this is what happened: A few days ago we had a text conversation, where one of them asked us for suggestions/remedies, stating that their problem was that they were having diarrhea at the moment and wanted it to stop (they weren't on any meds that could have caused it). just to say a few seconds later that they were currently constipated (which they usually are) and that they didn't want to be anymore. I was confused, so I asked them something along the lines of: 'I don't understand. Are you constipated or having diarrhea right now? Sounds a bit contradictory that you're having both at the same time, which one do you need help with?'.They started changing their words to prove they said nothing wrong (instead of just answering the question), while I tried to explain that I still didn't understand because both things didn't seem to add up, so we ended up arguing and they ultimately got mad at me and started accusing me of not understanding on purpose so I could make a big deal out of it, called me f*cking annoying, and claimed that I never shut up because I'm always trying to be on top of everyone and expect everyone to be perfect. Then, they started demanding apologies because, in their opinion, I'm constantly addressing everyone's mistakes, and that I never address them in a good way.I told them that my question was genuine and I wasn't trying to be rude, but they just started saying that I just asked to mess up with them because 'there was no way for my question not to be interpreted as bad-mannered since there were no indications to think otherwise' and 2 other people had interpreted my message the same way (kind of trying to pull an ad numerum to me, even when they didn't even make a majority of all the people that were involved?). I also told them that maybe I wouldn't have been so persistent if they had just answered the question instead of constantly changing their words and straight up insulting me when they couldn't or didn't want to keep defending their point.So, AITA for not feeling responsible about the way they interpreted my question and thus not apologizing?P.S. English is not my (nor any of my friends') first language, so I'm sure some things in the post may end up being confusing. Also, note that I'm, in no moment, referring to typos; I don't go around correcting everyone's typos because I understand touchscreens and keyboards aren't the best at avoiding them, and I know how to interpret them if I have enough context to do so.Edit: Tried to clarify what I tried to say because some people told me they didn't understand what I wanted to convey. Also, to everyone calling me a hypocrite for not making a perfect use of English as I claim to, maybe you're just assuming it and missed the P.S. where I clearly state that English isn't my first language and that I'm aware that not everyting I wrote in the post would be perfect. Or maybe you missed my first few sentences where I say 'I try to be as precise as possible', not that I'm perfect and never make mistakes. Willing to discuss the topic in my first language, though ;)Edit 2: To everyone in the comments calling me out for criticizing my friends when they make mistakes while not being able to handle being told that I'm wrong: I have no problem with being corrected (I'll defend my point until proven wrong, though), I'll just correct myself or move on. My problem is when they straight up insult me when they run out of explanations and say I only talk to them with bad manners.Edit 3: Update here.",

Last year my neighbors (31F, 30sM) moved in downstairs after the unit had been empty for a while. They were good neighbors until this year when they had a baby. Apparently they had to go through ivf and had a bunch of miscarriages, she posted all about it on Facebook. I thought that was TMI but whatever. I’m only her Facebook friend because she added me. She’s made a big deal about being pregnant and it’s been annoying to see but I just ignored her.Anyway since she’s had the baby I’ve had to deal with the crying from downstairs. It’s not as bad as I expected but it still is really annoying. I’ve gone down and knocked on their door a couple of times to tell them to keep the noise down. Every time they apologize and blame their baby but nothing has changed. I got fed up and reported them to our landlord for making too much noise. The landlord talked to my neighbors who are now turning it around on me, saying my dogs are too loud and I play music at night that wakes their baby up. My dogs aren’t that loud and hardly ever bark when I’m home. I got annoyed and went down to talk to my neighbor about it and she got really nasty with me, and blamed me and my dogs for “always” waking up her baby.She said they can hear every one of mine and my dogs footsteps and the dogs nails on the floor specifically, that my dogs bark the whole time I’m not home during the day, and that I put my music up too loud at night. I told her I can’t make my dogs not bark when I’m out, and that they’re dogs on hardwood floors and that I didn’t know what she expected living in a downstairs unit. I also told her I’m allowed to have people over and my music on whenever I want in my home. I don’t think it’s fair to ask me to change my life when I’m not the one who had a baby.My neighbor got an attitude and told me she was only asking for me to be “respectful of our shared space” and brought up hearing an argument I had with my ex a few weeks ago. I admit it was a little loud but it wasn’t that big of a deal. I laughed and told her that pretty much went out the window when she had a baby but she shut the door in my face. I reported the whole conversation to my landlord so there’s a record of my complaints because I want them and that baby out of here! When I was telling a friend about what was happening she told me I was being a major asshole to “struggling new parents” but I think that’s their problem and not mine. But I wanted to get some unbiased feedback because that friend is usually a little overemotional for my taste.",

	"body" : "I (23 M) have been dating my current girlfriend (21 F) for the past 18 months, and throughout our entire relationship she has been aware I’m a huge PlayStation fanboy. I grew up playing on my PS2, have always loved their exclusive games, and constantly play my PS4 at our apartment even today.I made my love for these games and consoles exceedingly clear to her and occasionally talk her ear off about them. Unfortunately, due to financial circumstances, I have been unable to purchase a PlayStation 5, despite wanting one since release. Despite my financial circumstances; however, I have always spent a lot of money on birthday and valentine gifts for my girlfriend as I place high importance on gift giving and receiving as a love language.Last year for my birthday my girlfriend only took me out for dinner, and while I was disappointed, at the time she was unemployed so I was satisfied with my gift. This year, though, she has a full-time job so my expectations were higher, especially after she asked me outright what I wanted. I explained to her that, unsurprisingly, I wanted a PlayStation 5 and that it would make my year. She told me she’d see what she could do.My birthday was last week and when I got home I was eagerly anticipating my PlayStation 5 to be waiting for me. My girlfriend called me to our room and told me she had made us dinner reservations at my favorite restaurant. While I was slightly disappointed that this might be my only gift, I was still holding out hope that she’d surprise me with the PlayStation when we got back home.When we got home; however, instead she gave me a handmade photo album binder with all of her favorite pictures of me and her together that must’ve cost less than $40 to make. I was extremely and visibly disappointed and asked her what happened to the PlayStation? She asked me if that was seriously all I had to say and then asked me if I didn’t care at all about the effort she put in for my gift. I told her I didn’t care about photos that I could just look at on my phone, and that I didn’t understand why she couldn’t have just bought me the PS5. She called me an ungrateful asshole and left to a friends house. I have texted her multiple times since explaining that I’ve never had a problem spending upwards of $500 on a gift for her and that gifts are important to me but she hasn’t responded.Am I the asshole for being disappointed?Update: I woke up this morning to a “we’re through” text from my gold digger of an ex girlfriend. You guys have been nothing but extremely pressed towards me, but I now understand I should only be looking for relationships with people who can match the type of gifts and money I put in. Took y’all’s advice and bought myself the PlayStation, and so far it’s already better than my girlfriend! Thank y’all for the opinions.",

So, I came up with what I thought was a brilliant plan to inject some excitement into our quiet neighborhood.Last weekend, I organized a surprise farm animal parade. I managed to borrow a couple of goats, a llama, and even a small pig from a local petting zoo. Dressed in ridiculous costumes, my friends and I led these farm animals through our usually serene streets, complete with a boombox blaring \"Old MacDonald Had a Farm\".Now, initially, I thought everyone would find it hilarious and refreshing. And while some neighbors did join in on the laughter and even snapped some pictures, others were... less than amused. One neighbor in particular was absolutely furious. He came storming over, red-faced, and started shouting about how I had disrupted his afternoon nap and turned our neighborhood into a circus.He accused me of being inconsiderate and called my idea \"a special kind of crazy.\" He even threatened to report me to the homeowners' association for causing a disturbance. I was taken aback—I genuinely believed I was spreading cheer and creating memorable moments.My friends' reactions are all over the map. Some think I'm a genius, while others think I've lost touch with reality and disrespected the peace and quiet of our neighborhood.

This park is a long drive away and the tickets are expensive, so this is a big deal for her, I spent extra on purchasing a fast pass to make sure she could go on all the rides she wanted to.Anyway, I asked Beatrice if she would like her brother to come (he had been asking), she said she would like that as long as we would still be able to go on all the rides she wanted to.This is because we can't leave Max alone at the park, it is very busy and there is nowhere for him to wait where we can see him, Max also isn't comfortable being left alone in an unknown place with strangers.I spoke to Max, I said he could come as long as he would be ok with going on all of the rides his sister wanted to, even the big ones.

We went on other smaller rides, my daughter was disappointed and I told him off, making it clear he was in trouble.When we got home I told him he wasn't going to be able to use his Xbox for a week as punishment for ruining his sisters birthday after he had asked to come and promised he would go on all the ridesMy sister found out and is saying I am the AH, I can see what she means but at the same time I made clear these would be intense rides",

	"body" : "My partner(27 NB) and I(27 NB) have been living together for a year now, along with their dog (F Husky). Due to my partner having less mobility from medical issues, I'm usually the one to take the dog on walks rather than just letting her outside.They adopted the dog after finding her living on the streets (our guess is she was abandoned), and her training is somewhat inconsistent. My partner taught her how to sit and go to her kennel, and housetrained her, but not much more than that when we began our relationship.I have more experience training dogs than my partner, so I've been doing my best to add to her training when I can (\"down,\" \"leave it,\" \"shush\", etc). The most difficult thing to train has been getting her to go a particular direction when we're on a walk. She doesn't know \"heel\" or \"follow,\" and we've had little luck training her in either command.Recently, I was taking her on a walk, and I noticed a rabbit sitting in the direction we were going, with foliage nearby that it could easily hide in. Since we'd end up startling it anyway, I had the idea to use another trick I'd been trying to teach her (\"look\", previously used to point out dropped food that she could safely eat) to get her to notice and hopefully chase it. I combined it with various body language (snapping head to a direction, acting like I was about to run) while I pointed towards the rabbit to hopefully get her to notice it, and let her instincts go from there.It worked, and we ended up running after the rabbit for a while before it hid in foliage that I wouldn't let her try to crawl under. We ended up going around the block once due to her trying to sniff out where the rabbit went and me not having the heart to stop her, and we ended up spotting either the same unlucky rabbit or a different one around the same spot where we lost track of the first one, with me repeating the \"look!\" and point to start up another short chase.I've since managed to get her to run in arbitrary directions by pointing, repeating body language, and calling \"look,\" and told the story of the original rabbit chase to my partner, who found the incident funny, but reminded me not to let her actually catch anything. I wouldn't allow that anyway, for several reasons, and the rabbit could easily outrun me/a dog leashed to me.I told this story to a friend a while ago, who didn't find it as amusing as the two of us did. They expressed the opinion that this was cruel to the rabbit, and that I shouldn't encourage the dog to chase it. I said that I would never have let the dog actually catch or harm any wildlife, and that in the grand scheme of things, an additional scare or two wasn't going to matter to a prey animal. The friend didn't press the issue, but I've been thinking back on it, and wondering if letting the dog chase wildlife on purpose was maybe a bit too much.AITA for allowing/encouraging a dog to chase wildlife, even if I had no intention of letting her actually harm/catch anything?Edit: Looks like I'm TAH on this one. Fair enough, I won't contest the judgement, but for everyone saying \"don't teach your dog to chase small animals,\" that ship has long since sailed. I mentioned that she was adopted off of living on the streets in the post already. How do you think she got food while living wild? If 5+ years of not letting her chase anything up until this one incident hasn't changed her inclination to go after squirrels, birds, and rabbits any time she sees them, I doubt she'll ever be trained out of it. I'll just continue to pull the leash short when I spot any wildlife she might try to go after in the future.",

When the teacher asked our class what being a man meant he gave the only good answer. He said it means taking care of the people that you love no matter what. It was a very him answer, and everyone would talk about how sweet it was, that this 6 ft guy cared so deeply about his little sister but I quickly learned she was insufferable.I remember going over to his house one night and it was 10pm and he had HS and had gotten off of work. She didn’t like the meal he cooked for dinner and wanted to eat something else. He says won’t you just eat it? Just for tonight? I’m really tired. She says no, I’d rather starve. He relents and makes her a different dish.I said, “You know, my brother would have laughed in my face if I pulled that.” Well, he wouldn’t be cooking for me in the first place but. She said, “Is your brother mean? Does he not care about family?” She’s seemed entitled to me, and she’s 12. Your brother doesn’t have to do shit for you.She would also be too tired when he asked if she wanted to help with laundry, etc. I said she was lazy, and he got defensive and said she was 12 and exhausted from school. I would tell him she seems ungrateful, and he said you can’t expect a 12 year old to be grateful to be looked after, she didn’t ask to be alive. It really frustrating that he denied all criticism of her, and we got into a big fight about it where I called her spoiled and said she needed to go into foster care if her dad won’t look after her, and he kicked me out and broke up with me.I could have seen myself marrying him, and he broke it off just like that. To make matters worse he is now dating his best friend, a total pushover that never criticizes him and dotes on his sister.

Me, my wife, my dad, and our 19 month old son in a restaurant, we order food and while we wait, my wife takes out about a half of a scone that was purchased from a nearby bakery earlier. As she breaks a thumbnail size portion for our son to munch on, a male employee approaches our table to tell us: “food from another place can not be consumed in the premise” We ask again if he wants to stop feeding our baby the scone, and he confirms we are not allowed to feed the scone to our 19 MO because it is food from outside, regardless of the size or type of the food, then walks away. In my previous experience (although limited to Australia), when we walk in, we are asked if we need high chair/baby plate/fork, and no one really pays attention to what we feed our baby, which is either a baby pouch meal from grocery stores or a homecooked meal in a small glass tupperware. I began to wonder: \"Who asks for a restaurant's permission to feed a morsel of baked goods to a baby while waiting for the food?\"“If a baby gets hungry while waiting, parents usually feed milk/baby food, but if that is prohibited, baby will likely cry/throw tantrum, which is nuisance to other customers, so what? Just walk outside and feed your externally sourced food to your baby and when the order is served, come back in and proceed to feed ONLY the food from the restaurant to the baby?”I complain to my wife that the service is unacceptable, a waitress approaches to ask what is wrong, and I clarify whether the man who asked my wife to stop feeding our son was the manager or a waiter. My voice must have been loud enough so my wife tells me to lower my voice. Manager notices this and returns to us, gives us a lecture on why the company's policy needs to be enforced for cross contamination reason. My wife asks to elaborate on cross contamination bit and manager suddenly talks about a possibility of a customer wrongfully accusing the restaurant if he/she gets food-borne illness from consuming food from outside. My wife says we won't hold your restaurant responsible for any potential foodborne illness, and the manager walks away again. As my dad was running out of his lunch break time(he slipped out from work to dine with us), we ate there instead of leaving.

She ignored me completely, told me she’s doing it for fun, never could afford classes as a child and she’s loving it and she’s not going to stop and I have to cope.I called her insensitive and she called me an asshole.My other flatmates agree with her and they don’t want to understand what toxi can environment ballet is.Bjt they told me to cut it out and I really don’t get it.

Just a little annoying thing : he always challenge himself to learn new things, the kind of guy who one day  decide to try to learn piano, or a new language or read all the books of one author and usually succeeds. Actually he doesn't pressure me to do anything nor neglect me or the house.. But I don't know, sometimes I feel exhausted living with him.Last year, I wanted us to move closer to my family and before getting engaged, Tom insisted on really getting to know my family. I love my family but I was wary because they hated my previous BF. Turned out I was wrong, they all adore Tom, even my overprotective big brother told me he's the one. My dad and Tom goes running together (they proposed me to tag along but I don't like it) and even talk about doing a marathon next year.This month, I took a 3 weeks vacation to travel a little. Tom wanted to tag along but I wanted some  needed me time, he was sad but accepted. I wasn't always on my phone during the trip but I saw Tom spent quite some time with my family. My SIL got a promotion and celebrated it at a restaurant with my family, I was surprised to see Tom there. My mom even added him to the Whatsapp family chat. I know SIL is in it as well as spouses of cousins but imo it is a bit much. An interaction in the group that really pissed me off was when Tom shared some home improvement stuff he did, my brother asked if he didn't feel too lonely at home and he responded « nah mate, living the dream lol » then tagged me and say «  when the cat isn't here, mouse dance » with lol emojis. I felt like he was mocking me.Moreover, he took a liking to my sister (F19), she is in year 2 of med school. Tom is a resident in pneumology and is becoming a rôle model for her. He helped her with classes a few times and when I was away, he even managed to get her to attend some consultations and surgeries.When I came back, I confronted him to tell I wasn't happy with all that. He apologized for the joke and told he didn't want to upset me. I said that he's too intrusive with my family and should leave sister to fend for herself with her studies just like I did. He disagreed strongly and said while I'm his no1 priority, there is nothing wrong with building a good relationship with my family and he is just helping a fellow med student to discover her future job. I got angry and left the conversation.I told the story to my bro, he said I overreacted and create problems by myself. My parents say I'm ridiculous and should be happy for my sis because she greatly benefits from Tom's guidance. My friends side with Tom too.I'm torn about all this. Am I the AH ?",

	"body" : "I (23F) met my bf (25M) about a month ago and he asked me to be his gf about a week after meeting. I felt like we were very head over heels for each other and I started sleeping over 2 or 3 nights of the week at his place which he was very happy to spend with me. My actual place of residence at the time was my parents living room after having lost my job and no longer able to pay my rent. He was aware of the situation and didn’t seem to mind that I didn’t have my life together atm.Last week, my parents and I had a huge argument where I stormed out the house with my things and had everything in my car. I told my bf, hoping he would let me stay at his place but his reaction to sum it up was “oh that sucks, guess you’ll have to sleep in your car”.It escalated to an argument of differing values. I was expecting him to not have any issue with letting me stay at his place since I was sleeping over often anyway and had a toothbrush there already. He earns very good money and has his own place so I didn’t think it would be a big deal. I wasn’t planning on being a stay at home nuisance forever I’d obviously look for a job asap.His pov was that 1) he’d only met me a month ago and didn’t feel comfortable taking me in 2) he didn’t want to have to feed me and take care of me bc he didn’t sign up for that 3) he told me since I wasn’t  working I’d just be a burden (he also said that if I didn’t get my sh*t together, we wouldn’t work out)This upset me a lot and I told him he was making me feel like he was only there for the good times and dipped in the bad times. He said I was straight up being ridiculous to even consider that he’d take me in. He wanted nothing to do with the situation and refuses to help in any way. In the end he let me stay a night on the condition that I’d go back to my parents house the next day and to him that was him “helping as much as he possibly could”.I’ve noticed he’s an extreme saver and a stingy person in general but I thought it was something I could look past and now I’m not so sure. Even my parents said he’s in the wrong for “not being a man and taking responsibility for his woman” but that might be a cultural/generational opinion.

I wouldn’t have gone on a major street, so I think my mom was over reacting and saw it as a lot more dangerous.

	"title" : "AITA for forgetting something my wife asked for??",
	"body" : "Hey, fellow Redditors, I need to get perspective from you all.So, here's the deal. We have this family tradition where we throw a big barbecue every first week ofthe month. It's like a way for all of us to come together, catch up, and chow down on some good grub. We have a large family, i have 3 brothers and 2 sisters. And as a whole we are almost 19 people in each barbecue.Now, it was my turn to host this month, and honestly, I wasn't exactly thrilled about it. You see, I'mnot the one who wears the apron in my house. That title goes to my wife, Alexandra (F30). She's a wizard in the kitchen, a cooking genius, and she takes care of most of the housework too. Me? I'm more like the clueless sidekick in the culinary department.But here's the kicker. In my family, it's always the ladies who take charge of the cooking and baking. It's not a hard and fast rule or anything, it just sort of happens that way. My brothers, my dad and I, usually keep our distance from the kitchen. I guess the women in my family have some kind of secret pact or maybe they're just better at it, who knows? But it has always being this way, even my dad doesn't allow us to help them.Anyway, back to the barbecue. Alexandra had been going all out to make this mind-blowing dish for the family reunion. Which being completely honest, i don't quite remember what it was. It was something with fish.  But here's where things took a turn for the worse. The day before the big event, I went to work as usual, but i had an immense amount of work so i didn't pay attention to my phone.When i came back home Alexandra comes up to me with a worried look on her face. She asks if I got this \"spice\" she needed for the dish. I asked what she was talking about. And she was visibly upset, and we started arguing. For my luck, she had being messaging me to get this thing, but as i just told you, i was busy. Of course if it was that urgent, she could've called me and being clearer, and how was I supposed to know.To give credit where it's due, Alexandra worked her magic and managed to salvage the dish. So that's why i wasn't worried, cause she always comes up with a plan B. It wasn't exactly what she had envisioned, but it still turned out pretty decently. All of my family loved it and complimented us.However while she was working i could see she was not looking good. So I asked her if i could be of any assistance. She turned to me and started laying into me about being an utterly useless partner for not being capable of getting just that spice.I talked this with my siblings, all of my brothers agree that she took it way too far for just a spice and it wasn't like i was ignoring her, i was busy, but my sisters on the other hand disagree and they think I was pretty much an AH.AITA??",

Im goth, and i hang out with people that arent goth because thats literally all there is really, and i get along with them very well and i love them.Ever since ive moved to this tiny (like 20 kids in the highschool grades) school, these two girls who are sort of outliers, discord furry kind of weird girls, keep badgering me about how im so cool and “emo” and how theyd look so cool hanging out with me, and that I dont belong with “basics” and just a bunch of really cringy things. They badger me almost every single day, and essentially objectify me. I hate it, it makes me feel like they want me to be a silent accessory because every time they approach me its about my appearance or its insulting my friends. We would not get along at all, from what theyve spoken about around me I honestly despise these girls and i hate them more for how they treat me like a glorified purse despite how hard i try to get away from them and stay with my own friends, and they insult my friends so damn much, talk about how i dont belong with them and how its so sad im turning “basic” whenever i show up to school in something comfy and not a super gothic outfit like i do sometimes.My friends have seen them take photos of me multiple times, and even send them to a discord chat once. They sit there across the room and just discuss my outfits, my hair, my makeup, etc loudly as if im a doll and nothing more, and take photos of me like my privacy doesnt matter. I told them firmly to stop, that i didnt like them and they made me wildly uncomfortable and tried to point out how wrong it was to treat someone like that and got suspended for a day for “bullying”. So ever since then, me and my friends have just been straight mean to them. They come up to me, i tell them i hate them and walk away. They badger my friends, i tell them theyre the basic ones and leave. I groan loudly every time they approach me and i just try my hardest to show them i DONT LIKE THEM while taking out my frustrations on this situation by being rude back, but i keep getting in disciplinary trouble for bullying, and so are all my friends.

She wasn’t really active in their lives, same with their dad who passed, so my bf and his sister are the only family they have.They talk a lot about growing up together, and his sister had said she misses it (even with the neglectful mom) because her and her brother were together 24/7 and those were the “good times”. Like huh?She is normally in college, but currently staying at his place for the break. She came out of the bathroom and says to him, “I almost ripped myself open.” He said, “What happened?” She said she accidentally put in two tampons and they both came out side by side which was really painful. She said she almost shed tears, it was that bad, “maybe I have vaginitis or something because ouch.”To which he laughed and said, “oh god, you’re okay though? You don’t need a doctor?”Like okay, I don’t know how he takes that so well. If my sister said that to me I’d be like ew, tmi, and also who asked?

He said let me see and she showed him.I offered to look instead but she said no, sorry, I’d prefer to show my brother. She literally covered herself up so I can’t see. She has no problem showing her brother her boob but dear god if I catch a glimpse.Anyway he said it actually wasn’t that bad and she insisted that it was, but was too scared to go to the doctor because of course.But yeah, I’ve mentioned how close they are to him before and he agreed. He says yes, she’s my favorite person. He frequently calls her a “baby” and I point out she’s only 4 years younger than us but he insists she’s a baby and I wouldn’t get it because I’m not close with my family like that.But it doesn’t have to do with closeness. It’s about respect for your family, and being classy. She comes off trashy with how she speaks around him.I went to talk to her and told her that I know her and her brother are close but she shouldn’t say that kind of stuff in front of him. She said I didn’t get her family dynamic. She said I was conservative and weird about nudity/sex, but they aren’t like that and are open with each other. She said her brother shared all his hookup stories when he first experimented in HS, it’s not a big deal to talk about sex, periods, etc. I said listen, sure, you can think that is okay at 15, but now it’s not, you’re both adults, so stop. There is no need to overshare.AITA? She seems annoyed at me.Edit: I’m not breaking up with my boyfriend. I talked to his sister to help them have a healthier dynamic, like most siblings do. It did NOT come from a place of insecurity or jealousy like people are implying but because I know their history and wanted to help. I’m more worried about him finding out and being upset with me lol.I did not realize people on reddit were so open with their family about their bodies/periods, etc. It is extremely odd to me, but I do get that different people have different dynamics. His sister is also bi, and gay people tend to be really open about their bodies, sex, etc, so that might also contribute to it.Also she will go to a doctor.

I dont understand, yeah its tragic she had to go through all that , its unfair, but should i starve myself on purpose to be on the same page i dont understand?But god forbid i get hold of the frying pan because i \"will make a mess and ruin the kitchen\" and i am not allowed to cook in their house because they (mom and dad) have this narrative about me that i am the clumsy guy that messes everything up and it has been like this my whole life.Whenever i wanna help someone my mom says \"How is he gonna help you, he cant fry an egg\" or some bs, and then she talks about me disrespecting her.I honestly try to stay as humble as possible because my parents really went through hard times as kids and i dont want to be an asshole who gives them no respect, i never asked for anything for birthday, didnt need any ps4's or 5's, have a pretty cheap phone and had it for a while, use my clothes till i literally cant anymore etc...But MY BROTHER gets all of it and more while being a crybaby and when i even point it out to them they get angry at me and start defending him. I am not saying this out of envy (idc honestly i am not interested in those things) but because i am refered to as the spoiled, picky eater who is too stupid for everyday life while there is the most spoiled kid i have ever seen living in the same house.This got off topic quickly but i needed to get this off my chest.",

	"body" : "My fiancé (35M) and I (30F) are getting married next year. We have sent out the invitations to our friends and family.My fiancé, Wil, has a friend. Let’s call him Ren (35M). Ren is married to Helga (35F). All 3 of them went to the same high school together so they have known each other for more than 20 years and are pretty close.Now the part where I may or may not be the AH…I dislike Helga. Not for any bad reason, but only for the fact that I always think my fiancé Wil, would have liked it if I would be as successful and financially literate as Helga. In short, I fall short in comparison to this lady. Helga is from a poor family and she has clawed her way up.I have made a few bad financial decisions before that have caused a few problems along the way. Yes, bad debts, credit cards, and the likes. Wil has been very supportive of me trying to make these problems go away by teaching me how to better handle my finances. I am still a work in progress but I do my best. I am getting there.Helga on the other hand, is a career woman, and I can tell she calls the shots in her marriage. She is frugal which may be the reason why she and R own several investment homes and a few stocks here and there at our age. I know this because Wil has asked them for financial advice sometimes. I am very happy for Wil to have friends like them who are successful and someone he can look up to.The reason why I don’t want to invite Helga is because I am uncomfortable that she may be judging us on our wedding. I admit that we may have overspent on our wedding budget. We have had help from our parents but we still ended up borrowing to finance the rest of the expenses. Ren and Helga know this because we have borrowed a portion of the money from them. We will pay of course.Wil thinks I’m crazy that I would prohibit him from inviting R’s wife who also happens to be his friend. He reminded me that these were the 2 people that have actually saved us both a couple of times by letting us borrow money when we are tight and for offering their home to us when we were kicked out of our rental a few years ago.My reason for not inviting her is I want to be comfortable in my wedding. Not having to worry about other people judging my financial decisions. Plus, Helga and I never really vibe. She is too different. Not in a snobby kind of way but we just don’t have anything in common. She owns expensive things and I feel like she’s showing it off whenever we are invited to their place. To be clear, she has not said anything about my bad financial decisions, it’s just a feeling based on the fact that she is thrifty, and that she would be against this type of spending.Long story short, Ren has RSVP’d “no” to the wedding (I knew he wouldn’t go anywhere without his wife). He has respectfully declined. Now my fiancé thinks that their friendship will never be the same again after this.I say it’s my wedding and I should have a say on who gets invited. So, AITA?",

For context, she doesn’t have nor want kids, she runs a business from home, and she typically works till like 3/4 am and wakes up at 11-12 which is frankly ridiculous. I have kept my mouth shut for years but today, I have had enough.When we met, I told her it’s time to grow up and stop acting like a teenager. I said that she’s in her 30s and it’s long overdue she learned how to wake up early.She said, “I wake up when my body wants to wake up. This sleeping pattern gives me most energy because that’s what my body likes.” I called bullshit and said she had to stop making excuses for her bad habits.She said she’d wake up when she wanted and to drop the subject.I didn’t, I said that career isn’t everything and once she finds a husband she might need to change her habits because no man will accept a woman who sleeps until midday.She told me I was a bitch, grabbed her coffee and left me in the cafe alone.

When he was about 2 years old, his mother started getting into drugs and hanging around some bad people. I also didn't pay child support. I saw my son every few months. Because of all of this, her father decided to take in our son (63M).Her father says she's welcome to see Jack as long as he's present. To my knowledge she doesn't see him that much. Her father has basically disowned her. He says if she wants to get clean he'll help her but he doesn't want to feed her addiction.I started seeing my son, Jack, again about a year ago. He's also stayed the night at my house a few times. I see him about once a week usually and we've gotten pretty close. I tried to stay consistent with my visits but it's hard because i'm not used to this. I wanted to get custody of Jack because he's my son but his grandfather is saying no. He's saying that I can't even remember to visit Jack. Ill remember him if he's living with me though.He mentioned that I've gone 5 years without talking to him. Jack knew I was out there, he could've asked for my number if he wanted to talk, so obviously he didn't care that I wasn't in his life. Nobody ever tried reaching out to me so I feel like I don't deserve all the blame.I asked Jack if he would like to live with me instead of grandpa and he said he doesn't know. I reassured him that grandpa's feelings wouldn't be hurt but he said he likes how things are now. I feel like it would be best for him though if he was with his real dad. I feel like he needs some stability in his life, which I can provide. His grandpa can't even take care of him by himself, he has to have his sister watch him sometimes. I would always be there and no one would have to watch him for me. Also, he's 10 so most things he can do for himself. He can feed himself, bathe himself, and entertain himself.I feel like his grandpa is being selfish for not wanting me to be with my son. I think he's mad because he failed as a father the first time and wants to have a redo with my son. I want to take Jacks feelings into consideration, but I also want to do what's best for him, even if he doesn't like it. Some of his family thinks I'm in the wrong here because he's been more involved in Jacks life. I feel like I can't be involved because they're not giving me the chance. AITA?",

When I met Tom I was a single mother and honestly times were rough. My previous husband disappeared just after the divorce and although he paid me some alimony I was on my own with raising our kids. Liliana was very difficult as a teenager. She had anger outbursts, refused to talk to me, told me she hated me. She didn’t like Tom either and got so upset with us once we announced pregnancy. She said it’s never going to be her sibling. When Bella was born hard times arrived. Tom and I argued so he moved out and I still had to attend my work (I work night shifts sometimes). Liliana started taking care of Bella when I was at work or when I was sleeping after a night shift.  Since then she, Bella and Kaia have been like best friends.It all changed when she got herself into medical university, she spent the whole day outside of our home. It got difficult on us, since Liliana stopped doing her part in house activities. When I ask her to cook or  help with her siblings she always responds “I have a test this week” and it’s the end of discussion.But apparently she got herself a job as a tutor. When Tom and I found out both of us got a little bit angry. As if we were lied to. Times are really rough and to support such a big family we need to work a lot so we need someone at the house to look after the young. Liliana knows it well enough but she chose to be selfish and help herself and not the family. I only told her I’m disappointed with her actions. Tom started yelling at her, saying she is so selfish and  the family would be better off if she didn’t work and just babysat her sisters. Liliana started yelling back at him, saying she would be better off working and that WE are the selfish ones. She started crying about never having money to buy herself anything, that her dad sends me money for herself and not for the whole family and she hates being the mother of the house. Tom kept on yelling at her and I just left the room because I didn’t want her to see me crying. But apparently Tom crossed some line because he yelled “if you are so miserable with us you are free to move out”. So she did.  I don’t know when and how but she got back in contact with her father. She moved out, lives with him and stopped replying to any of my messages and calls. I don’t know where he lives so I don’t have a way to go over to his place to talk some sense into her.I feel betrayed by her as she knows how much dependent we are on her. My ex husband also stopped paying me alimony for my daughter which is against the law. Tom and I thought about suing him for it. Maybe this way, if we cut her off money wise , Liliana would realize she is reliant on us too. WIBTA?Edit: by alimony I meant child support. I got languages mixed up.Edit2: since when chores are child abuse? It’s not like Liliana is the only one taking care of the children. She simply has to help out in moments of need like pick them up once a week or take them for a walk while I clean the house. As a family we have to work as a unit and not individuals who don’t care about each others.Edit3: since so many ask about it. We met to talk and as some of you suggested I said I’m fine with her living with her dad and he doesn’t have to pay me anything but I also won’t pay for her last three years of University as it’s 4 times what he was paying me as child support. She quickly changed her mind and lives back with me, no drama to it. Tom apologized to her for getting mad at her she apologized for acting out.",

My parents helped us with buying this house as a wedding gift and we are so grateful as we understand how lucky we are. Because of this, we made sure to furnish one of the bedrooms as a guest room so we can host others often.When I was a freshman in college, I dated Mark. We dated for about a year and it ended amicably. We remained friends after and he even introduced me to James. James and I started dating about 3 months after Mark and I broke up and he knew that Mark and I were friends that once dated. Over the years, Mark and I have always been friendly but we have gone through periods of times where we are closer as friends. James has made some comments saying how it’s “weird” that Mark and I are friends, but I told him that Mark and I are nothing more and I don’t see why it’s “weird”.A couple days ago, Mark asked me if he would be able to stay with me while he was in between leases. He said it would only be about 2 weeks. I told him of course and that I would get the guest room ready for him. I told James later that day and he got really upset and told me I should have consulted him first. I asked why as we have both had some friends stay with us and we didn’t consult each other then. James said it is because Mark is my ex and that it’s weird that he would be sleeping under our roof with him knowing our history. I said that he is being a bit dramatic and that although Mark and I have a “history”, he is just a friend.I ended up going to Mark’s apartment because I was so upset and needed to vent without getting any of our other friends involved. Mark just listened to me as I ranted about how crazy James was acting. I talked to my mom earlier about this as well and she said that she does think Mark and I have a “rather odd” relationship and that she sees where James is coming from. It’s been a few days and James and I are barely speaking and it’s clear he is still very upset.I truly don’t understand what the big deal is but I need to know, AITA?EDIT: I’m seeing a lot of comments saying that I am cheating with Mark, emotionally and/or physically.

Half the time I'm sweating profusely while my wife is shivering. Anything over 65ish° is too hot for me. I've had to compromise a lot since my wife had our daughter 2 months ago because obviously the baby needs it to be warmer than 65°.Well, yesterday I was really struggling.

I went in to our bedroom, which is also the nursery and I turned off the heat and turned the fan on me while I sat at my computer and relaxed a bit. The baby was sleeping in her crib. I hadn't intended on leaving the heat off for more than a half hour or so; just long enough to cool down, but I forgot I turned it off honestly. So when my wife came in to the room to collect our daughter and hour and a half later, the bedroom was 63°. She immediately flipped out on me because our daughter has been having a runny nose lately and my wife is convinced it's due to me constantly \"fucking with the room temps\".

She said if I keep messing with the room temperatures than she will leave. I told her that me shutting the heat off so that I can be comfortable for awhile before going to sleep (when the heat is on) isn't a big deal and it's selfish of her to think I should be in constant discomfort.

	"body" : "I (25f) am pregnant with my husband's (24m) child. It was a bit of a surprise pregnancy especially as my husband did not want to have kids yet, but ironically to the issue, due to a good amount of alcohol around 3 months ago we have found ourselves in this situation.  We have decided that we will keep the child as I am ready to be a mother and have been for awhile and my husband did say he is happy to have the baby.The pregnancy has not been easy, nor fun for me. Due to constantly feeling sick I left my job as my husband makes good enough money to support all of us and I would have left it once the baby comes anyways. To his credit my husband has done a great job supporting me and keeping the house running smoothly while I'm pregnant as I just haven't had the energy or felt good enough to keep a consistent schedule or do a lot of my household duties.However, he does like to drink. Usually he would have a beer or some wine with dinner and if he does anything on the weekends with friends he may have some liquor on top of that. It was fine at first but the liquor and beer especially make me feel nauseous a lot of the time and even when it doesn't seeing him drink (or smelling it afterwards) just makes me feel depressed because I can't partake in that activity and it is just reminding me of what I am giving up.As such I asked him to stop drinking at least during the pregnancy after which we can both drink again and he pushed back. He said he didn't want to give up drinking because it is the one thing he has to just calm him and help him relax after work, making sure the house runs smoothly and my needs are being met. If he hangs out with his friends, they will be drinking and he doesn't want to always have to be the DD or the one who can't \"have as much fun\" as them as he feels he doesn't have any other outlet. This did hurt my feelings as I feel that I should be worth more to him than alcohol and we got in a fight and he's been sleeping in the guest bedroom.AFAIK he hasn't drank in the past few days but he definitely has been more distant with me and instead of hanging out with me he chooses to just go lie down and sleep in the guest room. It hurts me because we are supposed to be a team in this and I'm suffering daily being pregnant so he should be able to lose something too as it's just for a few months.I feel like I might be the asshole because he has been really stressed out and instead of a 50/50 split of duties before the pregnancy we are looking more at around an 80/20 split now and maybe I should just let him have this as an outlet even if it does bother me. On the other hand, we are a team and I feel him giving up the stuff I have to give up would allow him to appreciate my pregnancy more and what I am going through.

During that time I visited her once for like 30 mins and told her how my husband and I got a new car so once she got out we would be able to come see her, as I knew she was really lonely and her depression was getting worse from being stuck in a hospital bed unable to move. While she was still in the hospital we talked on the phone every day and she kept saying how alone she felt and how she couldn’t wait to see me and my daughter(3f).Fast forward to when she got out, she called me and asked when I would be coming to see her cause it was “all she had to look forward to”. I told her it would be easier for me if she could just come to my house as driving for an hour was difficult with a toddler. She got annoyed and told me she couldn’t because she was “in a wheelchair she couldn’t get up the steps to my house and traveling was very painful for her still”. I thought that wasn’t a good enough excuse cause she traveled to get to her followup appointments and didn’t complain about that, but I told her maybe I would come to see her in a week or so. She seemed okay with that and left it alone for a week and then called to ask again when we would be coming to see her but again I told her it would be easier for her to come to us as I thought she would have gotten over herself by now. But she gave the same excuses and I told her maybe she should just rest up and I would see her when she was was able to travel in a car again. I thought that would make her see how silly she was being, and she would just come to us, but she just hung up and never came.I reached out a few more times and she kept telling me how left out she felt not being able to do anything with her friends, so I again offered for her to come visit and again she gave the same excuses. At that point I was really annoyed, and here’s where I may be TA I told her it was her own fault she felt left out cause she wasn’t making any effort to see anyone, she just kept using her wheelchair as an excuse. I get that she got injured breaking like half her body but they taught her how to get up the stairs before she left the hospital. She told me that I was being a shitty friend and she's glad I don't fully understand what she's going through and she hopes I never have to but that I could try to at least pretend to care that she's hurting. Which I found really hurtful of her to say. I have tried. I have invited her over and I always answer the phone when she calls even though I know she's just going to complain.

We’re twins,so everyone assumes we can like read each others minds and stuff,but we don’t really get along.The thing about my sister is that she’s mentally ill. Like,extremely so. She’s on serious meds,and when she doesn’t take them she’s prone to hallucinations and breakdowns. I don’t know exactly what’s going on with her,but it’s gotten bad enough that she’s had to be hospitalized. My sister gets made fun of for being the way she is. People at school call her a freak and stuff. She’s also got dyslexia and people call her stupid because of it.It always annoyed me when she would forget to take her meds and end up having one of what my family calls her “episodes” can’t really go into detail,but there pretty bad.I don’t interact with her at school,I ignore her and she ignores me. People have tried to make fun of me for my sister being a freak,but I ignore it. So my sister and I’s 17th birthday is coming up,and I planned on having a couple friends over. My friends have made fun of my sister before,and I don’t really say anything because their kinda right. They mostly just call her crazy and stuff. Well,when I was going over the plan with my parents I mentioned that I didn’t think want my sister there. Mostly incase she forgot to take her meds or something and had a break down while my friends are there. I don’t want her to hear them making fun of her either.My mom agreed with me,and said she could tell my sister to go to a friends house for her birthday. My dad disagreed,and said it would be wrong to send her away on what’s also her birthday just because of something she can’t control.It caused an argument,and my sister found out and her and my dad basically called me and mom an asshole.

One of my favorite things to do now that I'm Free is go shirtless-- after a shower, while making dinner, working in the yard etc. It's very nice. However, the last time I visited my parents I asked if they'd be comfortable if I occasionally didn't wear a shirt (not to the same extreme, but for example going back to my room after a shower or going swimming). They said no; while they respect my identity they don't want to see me shirtless at any time. This isn't them being prudes- my dad does the same thing. Sometimes he even goes sunbathing shirtless. So I feel like their being kind of hypocritical by saying it would make them uncomfortable if I did it. However, I also don't want to start a whole bunch of drama over it.

I assumed from the beginning they would break up eventually as she isn’t my son’s usual type and seems very blunt and what I assume is gothic which my son has always disliked. However, they’ve managed to stay together this long and I haven’t overly commented on the fact because I understand he’s an adult who can make his own decisions, but I’m also an adult who can make mine. His girlfriend and I have never seen eye to eye, and my son says it’s my fault, of course because I’m his evil mother I guess! If you ask her a question, she gives you the most logical, unsugar-coated response. She doesn’t really talk to my side of the family but does talk to my husbands and my daughter who adores her. She doesn’t like kids and when I asked her about kids she told me as much, and I find this girl to be completely disrespectful with how quiet she is, how she acts strangely around my family at events, and how unaffectionate she is with people. My family is very talkative and affectionate and she is disinterested in creating that relationship. My son says she’s not affectionate with her own family and that my family has made it impossible for her to be close to because we have always treated her disrespectfully, which I don’t see. She seems to pick on my son, which I don’t appreciate, but he says is in good fun and is very common in her family to have a lighthearted go at each other. I said I found this entirely disrespectful and so she hasn’t done it in my presence again. My son has gone LC with me and for awhile even cut contact because he said I treat this girl so poorly. Now, he wants to propose to her and I just think it’s a bad idea. I don’t know what they have in common if anything, she’s cold and prickly, she hasn’t spoken to me or my family in months, and I think she’s manipulating him and taking him away from us. I told him this was a bad idea and I wasn’t going to hold my tongue anymore and he said he’s an adult and can do what he wants and he’s tired of how I act to her. I told him if he gets engaged to her I won’t speak to him again. My husband told me that this is an asshole thing to do and he has never seen why I can’t get along with her since she’s so nice. My daughter (28) feels the same way as my husband and told me I need to get it together and how I always put me and his girlfriend into situations where I know we’re going to buttheads and that I always “start” it over silly things.

He basically laughed it off and kept eating his ice cream. A few minutes later I added that not only did he get the regular size cone, he got one that was dipped in chocolate and he had just eaten deep fried fish and chips the night before. He got a little upset at this point and replied that he had done four intense workouts this week and had already lost 7lbs over the past 5 weeks and that it doesn’t matter if he eats a desert once a week. I told him that I just didn’t want him to undo all of his hard work since I know he wants to be ready for vacation.Later he told me that he didn’t think it was ok for me to fat shame him in front of our kids.

I'm (33f)  having my first baby at the end of the year, and I live in a very high cost of living area where daycare for infants will total between $27,000-$35,000 per year. Additionally, waiting lists for infant rooms are up to a year long, so we are starting our search for an affordable daycare now. I can't leave the city for my line of work, and to be honest nothing in the surrounding area is much cheaper. If anything happened to our jobs we would need to move back to search for something in our industry.In addition to looking for a suitable daycare, we are trying to think out side the box for ways to save. Including: parents coming to take care of the baby for a month or so to kind of kick the can down the road of when daycare needs to begin, and moving into a studio or efficiency one bedroom to offset the costs by around 1k/month.My parents are from poverty and working class backgrounds (mom (51f) has 9th grade education and is a cashier at a fast food place, dad (52m) works in distribution factory.) And my mom said she could take off around 4 weeks to help after maternity leave. This is great, it means baby will be a bit older when he has to go to daycare and we will save a little and spend time with family.My partners (30f) parents won't commit to anything. They are both doctors who by choice work 6 months a year. They are divorced, and one of them (MIL 65f) lives alone in a 3 story house with a baby grand piano that she has never learned how to play (just trying to paint a picture here); MIL also paid for her niece to go to college. The other (FIL 65m) lives with and provides for his niece (different niece) and her 3 adult sons.Neither of them will commit to any time or financial assistance after the baby is born. They say they will \"do what they can when they can\" and won't reassure us of any level of support. I told them how we would love them to stay with us for a couple months and they won't do that, even saying they won't do it if they are not working.Of course, I've also mentioned the possibility of helping financially. I didn't specify a number, just asked them if they would consider it. When you have a new baby and no help, everything makes a difference; but I want to be able to predict things like \"should I use this money for groceries, or should I put it towards daycare? Am I able to catch a break and use this for a takeout dinner or a babysitter?\"AITA for expecting a solid answer on what we can expect? AITA for expecting more involvement and interest in helping my family get off to a good start? This is our first baby and everyone's first grandchild. Why can't I get a clear answer and why isn't there more interest in helping?Edit: thanks for the judgement that I am the asshole. I've read every comment. First, I am married to a woman and our parents were all very involved with the process of bringing this child to this point. All of them, enthusiastically. I have tried to be responsible by planning, and to me asking them is part of that planning and preparation. My wife is indeed shocked that they are not willing to help and that they have gone cold. Since I am the asshole and have no right to their time or money, I will no longer consider them in our future plans or facilitate anything with them at all. They don't get to play a role in my life without having empathy and perspective or without consequence. Thanks all.",

First of all, D’s mother is already throwing her a bridal shower. Throwing her a second one would just be repetitive.

	"title" : "AITA (38M) for telling my (40F) Girlfriend that her (17M) son should be driving by now?",
	"body" : "I have been thinking about this way to much and I need some opinions.Context/Background:So I am using the term girlfriend loosely. We text during the week and go on dates during the weekend. She usually stays one night or so per weekend at my place. I never go to her place. I have never met her son and her son doesn't know I exist. One of those types of relationships if you want to call it that which I am fine with. We both work a lot during the week and I like having my own house to myself.Her son is 17 and will be 18 in three months. He gets good grades, plays sports and has absolutely nothing wrong with him. My GF parents' bought him a very nice car when he turned 16.My GF parents' are retired and borderline rich and take the son to a private school 20min away every morning and pick him up every evening.This is in rural southern USA. There is no uber, doordash, lift any of that. If you need to go somewhere you have to drive. The closest gas station is a minimum of 4 miles away.I am 38 years old and had a dirt bike and atv when I was 11. My only rule growing up was be home before dark. Which I obviously grew up in a different world than we have today.Argument:This started innocently enough. My GF had a rare break at work for a few days and her parents told her to take her son to school instead of them. She was complaining about getting up a 6am on her day off when I chimed in that her son is about to be 18 and had his own car that he should be driving himself to school.Her: He's not ready to start driving he says he is uncomfortable.Me: Well that's normal for a new driver. The way you become comfortable is by driving. Has he had drivers education at <insert private school>?Her: Oh that's an elective and he says he isn't taking it.Me: Well driving is a very important skill that everyone should learn. The sooner he starts the better, he is already behind.Her: He is not behind! Driving is not a requirement. I don't care if he ever learns how to drive. I am not going to force him to do anything that makes him uncomfortable and dangerous.Me (flabbergasted): Um being uncomfortable is a normal feeling when learning new skills. Driving is an absolute requirement for adults. What if he needed to rush you to the hospital?Her: That's what ambulances are for! Besides you don't have kids and have never raised kids so what would you know?!Me: This is true I haven't, and I grew up in a different time and era. I am entitled to my opinion though and I think we need to agree to disagree and drop this subject for the evening.That was pretty much the end of it. We dropped it and continued on with our normal date. I could tell she was irked by my comments but I avoided the topic. A couple days later she told me she had to drop her son off for a DATE?! before she would be on to my house. I shuddered and told her I would see her soon.",

	"body" : "I am a h addict. I was an absolute menace to my family and friends but my parents refused to give up on me and 4 years ago with the support of family and friends I decided to be sober and I have managed to stick with it till now.Me and my sister were close but now she her and my brother are best friends. I don’t blame her it obviously because of my addiction. When I was actively taking h my sister cut me out of her life even when I recovered she acted like i didn’t exist and hasn’t directly had a conversation with me for 4 years. When we’re at a family function she avoids me, if am talking to her she avoids eye Contact and gives 1 word answers, if she hears that my cousin invited me out she immediately doesn’t want to go. Once I tried to join a conversation she was having with my our cousin and she straight up just walked away. I will tell her happy birthday and she won’t respond or reciprocate. I knew that i couldn’t undo the damage so at 1 point I stopped apologizing.Now the issue. I was at a family functions with my cousins and someone asked me about me about my future plans and I say I plan to apply for a fellowship, my other cousins chirps up and says my sister had received that same fellowship and I should ask my sister to look at my application because my sister edits all her essays really well. My sister says she busy so no one should ask her to look at their application and everyone just became really awkward because we all know the message was directed to me, this is not the first time she will make indirect messages about me. So I told her that I wasn’t going to ask her and she was trying to say to my cousin (she wasn’t even making eye contact to me or addressing me ) that she wasn’t speaking to a specific person here and at this point I just snap, it has been 4 years of being like ghost a by her and I was sick of it. I told her for once can she stop being a bitter person and get over herself for one minute. She looks at me and says she not going to argue with me and leaves. After she leaves my cousin tell what happen to their parents and my brother and all of a sudden everyone is telling me that I shouldn’t have started anything with my sister, like am the one who started it.It been 4 years; I have apologized and my parents helped me pay back all the money I owed her what more can I do. She ignores and keeps acting like am invisible and the worst part it she always to talk to me through another person when she does rarely talk to me. I feel like she is using her silence to punishing me for being an addict but am done feeling bad. If she feels like it was hard for her then imagine how hard it was for me to be an addict. I feel like I was just standing up for myself but the ordeal has been on my mind for a couple of day and am now wondering wether I was an ass.",

I said yes, because I didn't intend to stay out long and I figured he actually needed me and my fiance and I could just stay up later anyways since we don't work tomorrow.

Better yet, go give it to your fucking boyfriend because he clearly needs you and the booze more than I do.\" I tried pleasing my case and she said \"either leave or I fucking will\".

She is the girl of my dreams and I want to spend the rest of my life with her.The problem is her plants. I knew that she loved plants, and I have grown to love them too. When we started dating she had about 3 plants and we together had 7 total (4 together, 3 hers) This to me is a perfect amount of plants, and gives us something to do together. Ever since we moved in it has spiraled out of control.She is constantly buying new tables, hangers, stands, pots, etc. to give more space. She says that because she has all this space, she needs more plants. She is on TikTok looking at different plants with a sparkle in her eye that she doesn’t get with me. She now is using Reddit SOLELY for plants and plant maintenance. So I know she won’t see this. We are constantly buying more and more plants, and I think we have about 20 now.We have been living together for 20 days. I brought this up to her and she immediately went on the defensive. “Why, do you not like them?” “We have the space, why not get more?” I am just thinking, at what point does this madness stop?She is spending more time with her plants than she is with me. I want her to have hobbies, but they need to be in moderation.We do not have much spending money, and I have brought this up to her. She does not seem to care and is still wanting to buy more plants.I have gotten to the point where I am now deliberately not watering the plants when she asks me to, hoping that they will slowly die and she thinks she is not a good plant caretaker.

So, ever since the summer of 2023, my nephew has graciously taken up work at a restaurant. He has never really liked it, and his older colleagues used to bully him and his managers wouldn’t do anything about it. Back in November, he kind of snapped, and he impulsively quit the job in order to focus on school and preparing for college.

So ever since he quit, I’ve been nagging him to take up some other job, if only so that he can afford his own food and buy cool stuff he wants (my nephew is really into the guitar so he’s always looking at fancy equipment to buy).

Unfortunately, she got a splinter deep under her nail yesterday and after not sleeping because of throbbing pain, she asked me if I thought she should go to urgent care in the morning or go on a run to stick to her training and see a doctor later. I told her to go early since it hurt so bad, and that I would go with her. We live in a city so I went to her house and the ran together (short, easy run).I waited ~1 hour and when she came out she said it was a brutally painful procedure (8-9/10 pain). Then I asked her about pain at the moment and she said 1/10. Thinking she felt fine and trying to distract from the horrible experience, I asked if she wanted to run home. She said she was worried about sweat falling where they removed the nail, but I said given doctor instructions that should be fine.She then said I was extremely gaslighty and devoid of compassion because instead of giving her a hug and comforting her, I asked her to run home. Rather than feeling comforted by her boyfriend, she said I made her feel like a wimp for not wanting to run home and that I made the situation worse.I tried explaining that based on how I understood the situation (I.e., strong desire to run that day, 1/10 pain, etc.), I thought distracting her and carrying on with normal life would be the best path vs. showing more compassion. I told her now I understood why she felt that way and that I could’ve shown more compassion, but that she shouldn’t be mad at me because I wasn’t a dick, and I wasn’t trying to gaslight her - I simply thought a different course of action was best.She said that she understood my actions but that no one in their right mind would act that way, and she said that my hyper-logical brain did not lend itself to being a supportive and caring boyfriend.At this point, I should’ve just hugged her and said sorry given she was in distress about the morning events, but instead I got quite defensive and ended up walking away, making what would’ve been a nice gesture of going to the doctor with her the opposite. AITA?Edit 1: To answer questions, the nail removed was a fingernail in her hand, not her toe. Also, when she mentioned the sweat, I asked her about doctors instructions for washing hands, etc, and the doctor said that it could get wet.Edit 2: The following argument wasn’t about me pushing her to run after she said no - I quickly understood she didn’t want. The argument was about whether my initial suggestion to run was inconsiderate (which I take the point a lot of you say and appreciate the feedback / pov)",

A few months ago, the 5 of us decided to have a party/stay over with a few other friends from college. We decided to book hotel rooms. Me and one other friend(Reva) were dating at the time and we said we needed separate rooms and would pay whatever it cost us while the others decided to stay in rooms that would occupy 4 people each to reduce costs, even though some of them were couples. However we only had a short time window and the hotel we were looking at became fully booked except for 3 rooms. But there were 12 of us and the only way we could stay there is if me, Reva and our boyfriends decided not to have private rooms. The only other hotel we could find for those particular dates and at affordable prices had a rule that would allow only 2 people in one room, but this would cost the others more than what they were originally planning.My friends(apart from Reva) decided it was unacceple for them to pay more because of our demand. They proposed the rest of them would only pay the price they intended to pay for the original hotel and we should bear the difference, or we should agree to huddle together with them, 4 people in a room. We felt this was unfair since they would also be getting extra facilities in the second hotel even if they staying there because of us and that we had the right to ask for private rooms. We had a huge heated argument over it in which one of the girls told us we could stay seperately if we wanted and they'll find someone else to stay with them, and we replied by saying they didn't want us only someone to pay the money. I even ended up crying in front of them but at the end we decided to not go to their party and stay seperately.We were still on okey terms after this but 2 days later the other three rounded up on lana, telling her how unfair we were being and basically pressuring her and not allowing her to speak up for herself. This fight was only between us but they decided to involve a third party, a classmate of ours, to mediate telling them a story completely different from what actually happened so the classmate also ended up siding with them. I was not around when this happened and only have second hand accounts of these events but when I heard about this I got really angry and I bad mouthed my friends to the said classmate, which on retrospect I shouldn't have done, it was a mistake on my part. Now it's possible that this third party informed my other friends of what I said, I don't really know since those 3 have stopped speaking to me and Reva since that day.Both of us felt like we had done nothing wrong and felt they were being childish so neither of us made any effort to resolve things either.

It consisted of a 65\" TV, my work desk and pc, my monitor, a small couch and a pool table.When my wife found out about this, she was livid and now I'm sleeping in the guest room.So reddit, am I the AH?

	"body" : "My 34 year old brother Michael died two weeks ago apparently from cardiac arrest from taking too many pain pills for too many years. He died in his apartment and it was a week before anyone noticed he was missing. Sad, but true.Anyways, my mother is acting like the grieving mother and it rubbed me the wrong way. I told her I didn't understand why she was all sad when she hadn't communicated with him in three months? My brother wasn't some street junkie. He actually had a corporate job and did crossfit. My mom and him stopped getting along once he stopped giving her money to enable our other siblings who are the real bad apples.I just don't understand how a mother can go through months without knowing if their child is dead or alive because they don't reach out to them but then act all sad when they die. For the record, my mother does reach out at least least once a week to the other kids and panics if she can't reach them. She's not neglectful to all of us.Some people might say there were dynamics in play but I've been there and know that's it's way more simple than that. My mom just didn't care. For example, my brother sent her flowers for her birthday every year and she'd quickly call him for his - like three days after his birthday.I've been called heartless and an asshole. I don't think I am. He's being cremated and she wants to keep his ashes. For what? So you can stuff him in a cupboard with the Liquid Plumber?",

She absolutely hates flying, always has, but does it if there’s no alternative.Well, last night we were looking for a movie to watch and settled on Society of the Snow on Netflix. It’s a new movie based on the true story of the Andes survivors, and it has a very horrific plane crash scene in the first 10 minutes. My girlfriend was on the verge of an anxiety attack and it took me awhile to calm her down. When she pulled herself together, she said she won’t be able to fly anymore and won’t come to the wedding with me. I asked her if she was serious; I bought her ticket besides mine, and they’re non refundable. Money aside, my family and I want her there. I also can’t imagine our future lives if she is serious about never flying anywhere.So I told her all that. I also told her she can do therapy in the future to overcome this, and I can help her with that if she wants, but for now she needs to find a way to temporarily put her fears on hold and go on this trip as we planned. She got upset and said I was pressuring her, mentioning the money loss and telling she had to come. She also saw as an ultimatum when I said our future together could be impacted, though that was not my intention at all, I was just hypothetically mentioning the difficulties this could bring to our lives.Am I really TA for insisting she comes to the wedding?",

	"body" : "I (38M) was a mess before meeting my wife (37F). I really big mess. I was an alcoholic, had poor hygiene, was hopping from job to job, etc. But she saw something in me that nobody els did, not even me. I loved her, I loved her so so much.We were only 1 year into our relationship before getting married I didn’t listen to people saying it was too soon, I was so in love. She turned my life upside down, I was a better man all thanks to her. I was 23 when she gave birth to my son, that was the happiest day of my life everything was going great. As he got older he resembled his mother so much, his wavy black hair, his face shape, eyes, lips everything he had he got from his mother. He was the male version of my wife. We didn’t have a strong bond but we talked sometimes. He was definitely a lot closer to his mother but I was ok with that. My life was perfect but then everything came crashing down in one phone call.I was told my wife and son were in a car accident, I rushed to the hospital but unfortunately by then my beautiful wife had passed. My son was still alive, unconscious on a hospital bed but in that moment all I could think of was how my soulmate, my love, my everything was gone. However son made a full recovery. It hurt my heart every time I looked at him, I began to hate him and avoided him like the plague. The thought of him making it but not my wife made me furious. I would never hurt him but if it came down to him or her it’s obvious who I’d choose. I started drinking again, my mental health was very poor and I’d get into arguments with my son often. My life was the definition of hell.Four days ago my son was yelling at me for being “the worst father ever” and was ranting about how he needs help and how horrible his life was. I understand that he was hurting but so was I. I was ignoring him because I had already heard this rant a million times but then he snatched a bear out my hand and threw it on the floor, that’s when I snapped. I told him “You’re not the only one suffering. Stop being so self centred, just get over yourself!” There was more that I was going to say but he left the house, I made no effort to follow him assuming he just needed to be alone. I haven’t seen or heard from him since.The police have been looking for him but deep down I hope he doesn’t come back. I know that sounds bad but I shouldn’t be forced to take care of someone just because I’m related to them, I’m only human and I already spend most of my life depressed. I just want a fresh start. I do hope he’s doing well but he’s not welcome back into my home. Besides why would he want to live with “the worst father ever” he’s old enough to care for himself. Like I said I’m only human, he expected so from me when I was suffering just as much. So AITA?Update: he came back 2 days ago, I’m not sure who he was with (if he even was with anyone) but we haven’t said a word to each other. I’m not going into detail I just came on to say that he’s not on the streets anymore.",

	"body" : "Throwaway for privacy as my husband uses reddit.I(40F) married my husband(43M) about 7 years ago, he had a daughter called M(14F) from a previous relationship.Me and M have always got along very well, her mother is not present in her life therefore she sees me as her mother-figure. I embraced this role as I cannot have children so I see M as my daughter.In the past year, M has become obsessed with the singer Harry Styles, by obsessed I mean she will neglect family responsibilities just to talk to her friends about Harry Styles, no offense to the guy but I don't know how they can talk about him so much.When she first got into his music we decided it would be a good idea to go see him as he was touring near where we lived and we managed to find tickets from resellers as we were too late to get them ourselves (quite expensive by the way). M was lucky enough to get him to sign her poster and it has become her prized possession.For the past couple months, M has been neglecting her responsibilities (chores, helping with dinner etc.) Because she is either listening to, or talking about Harry Styles. Me and my husband put up with this because we thought it would blow over but it has only got worse.This takes us to yesterday, me and my husband made dinner after work and called M down, no response. We go up to her room to find that she is gone, her window wide open. It turned out, after many phone calls, that she disappeared to town with her friends to go buy Harry Styles albums/merchandise. I was furious when I found this out, mostly because of the sheer stupidity of seeking out when we would've let her go anyway. I decided that it was time she outgrew her Harry Styles obsession, so i waited for her to come home and ripped up her signed poster in front of her eyes.She looked at me for a second before screaming, you would've thought we had died or something with how anguish filled her screams were. She looked at me with tears and shouted \"I HATE YOU, YOUR NOT MY MUM, MY MUM WOULD NEVER DO THIS!\" Before slamming the door in my face and locking it.My husband said that I went too far but I don't see why she is so upset, she can just get another poster. I even went into her room and offered to get her another signed poster (which are very expensive) but she just ignored me.I feel very guilty, however this has been a long time coming in my opinion as she has been testing my patience for months now.AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for not investigating the smell of weed when my daughter had a friend over?",
	"body" : "For context, I (37F) own a local dispensary. I also have four kids 17M, 16F, 14F, and 12M. My husband and I are both stoners and we allow or oldest two to smoke (within moderation). We don't outright buy it for them, but they know where we keep it and we don't try to stop them from taking it.This brings me to the problem at hand. My daughter (16F) had a friend over this past Friday, let's call her \"Anne\" (16F). Anne comes from a relatively conservative, Christian family. Anne's mother knew what I do for work prior to letting her come over. She's aware that my husband and I smoke but doesn't know that I allow my OWN children to smoke.Anne and my daughter came straight home after school and I got home from work around 5:30. When I walked past the hall where the bedrooms are located, I could definitely smell someone smoking, but I assumed it was my husband or my son.I chose not to investigate my daughter and her friend because I generally trust my kids and don't like to barge in on them when they have company. I also didn't really expect this from them as Anne has always been the innocent type. Plus, they seemed to be acting normal when they came into the kitchen.Well apparently Anne's mother smelled it on her daughter's clothes and drug tested her the next day. I asked my daughter and she confessed to me that the two of the smoked a preroll together in my daughters room. Understandably upset, Anne's mother called me to chew me out for supplying her daughter with drugs. I informed her that I did not give it to them and that they must have found my stuff on their own.She proceeded to insult me for being \"oblivious\" to the fact someone was smoking in my house. I told her that I smelled it but had assumed it was my husband. This made her even angrier and she began accusing me of being \"willfully ignorant\". I apologized profusely but she was still angry when she hung up.Over the past week, Anne's mother and her friends have making rude posts on facebook about what a bad mother I am. My own daughter is in hot water with me because she knows how I feel about breaking another parent's trust, but at the same time, if Anne is going to try it, I'd obviously prefer it be in a safe environment with stuff I know hasn't been tampered with. AITA?(TLDR: I smelled weed when my daughter had guest over at our house and now her mother is angry at me for not going to check on them)Edit: So it appears everyone is saying i'm and asshole. That's fair, I definitely should have secured my stash when I heard she'd be coming over. For those of you saying I should be thrown in jail have my kids taken from me, i'd like to clarify a few things. Contrary to some of your comments, my kids do not have \"unlimited access\". Majority of my stash stays in my closet, and the little bit we do leave out for them we actually monitor to know how much they are taking. Plus we never leave out more than a gram at a time and do not supply them with pens/carts. My kids are not stoners. They have easy access to it and do not feel the need to jump on any chance they have to get high. I have since talked to Anne's mother who will not be taking legal action. We can both agree on the fact that my weed needs to be more safely stored away when underage guests are over. Beyond that, Anne's mother is holding Anne accountable for wanting to try in the first place. Their rules are none of my business, through, Anne will no longer be allowed over to our house and my daughter will be searched before going over to her house.Edit 2: Stop assuming everyone is American.

Everyone else had invited everyone to their birthdays, and it was not a money or space issue as we had all partied at her place multiple times before, everyone brought own drinks, and there wasn’t going to be food.The main reason I was upset was because we were a minority in the group, and the exclusion seemed to be based purely on gender nothing else.

Our aunt does not speak a lot of Vietnamese so me and my brother eventually became less and less fluent.My younger sister ( 16 F) recently moved from Canada to Vietnam for high school, and just completed her first year of highschool.For some more context, Vietnamese is a very tonal language. Tones go up and down, so it’s a very hard language on the ears. My sister has a very high pitched voice, so it is already irritable to listen to in English, Vietnamese is another issue.My sister speaks mainly Vietnamese at home, which is a BIG inconvenience at home. I suggested that we only speak to her in English when she first came here so she would have a easy time adjusting to highschool. But my older brother keeps spoiling her, he studied a bit in Vietnam so he knows more Vietnamese then me, but for the past 3 years he’s been learning Vietnamese for our younger sister.Because of my brother, my sisters English skills are improving like a damn slug. And I can barely communicate with her.So fast forward, my boyfriend is over at our house while my brother and sister are playing. Play wrestling and tickling each other  like siblings do, and my brother is wining the fight so my sister is laughing and squealing in Vietnamese ( keep in mind what I said about the Vietnamese language and her high pitched voice).My boyfriend finds it annoying, and I do too.My boyfriend asks her if she can speak English and she said yes, so he said that she should start speaking more English.My brother gets up and defends her, saying that some Canadian guy shouldn’t tell a child what language they should speak in their own home.I defend my boyfriend, because he’s done nothing wrong. Her voice is irritable, so I get where he’s coming from.I tell my sister that she should start speaking English, and give up the Vietnamese because she’s in Canada.And like the spoiled little teenager she is, she cries and my brother just defends her as usual. Seriously, I don’t get why she’s so sensitive.After my boyfriend left, me and my brother had a huge argument. He said that this was a big adjustment for a young girl, and we should be considerate of her.I tell him that I’m just trying to help her, and the only reason she’s falling behind is because of her English skills. She has 90s in math and science, but 60s in social studies and English.I say that we shouldn’t adjust to her, she should adjust to us, she’s in a English speaking country.My brother just shakes his head, sighs and leaves.Now my brother refuses to talk to me and my sister is avoiding me, probably because if something my brother said.Am I the asshole for just wanting the best for my sister?",

She has been couch surfing and found a way to stay on campus for the last week but her school is closing and she was running out of options for housing so she called me.I tell her always that I want to support her in anyway I can, however, when she called me to come over Mother’s Day weekend I had to turn her away because I would just be so devastated if my son ever went to another woman’s home on Mother’s Day and didn’t speak to me. It’s just something i couldn’t support and I love her mother. I would never want to hurt her like that.My mother was an alcoholic but she did the best she could with what she had. My mother has passed on and I wish I could hug her again. I took the time to reiterate this to my niece after we got off the phone via text and she hasn’t responded. Am I an asshole?Edited: I am also a struggling alcoholic",

She doesn't stop now either, it's just constant insults about them in front of me or my dad. And she's all nice and all to them, though. But the second it's just me or my dad, she does not stop complaining.Even my maternal aunt seems to have joined in on the bandwagon- my mom and my aunt get together and talk shit about my dad's side.For context, I was more exposed to my paternal family and have been for most of my life. I rarely see my maternal side because they all live in a pretty far part of the country.I don't know, my whole life, it's felt like my mom's been trying to force this hatred into me, to hate my dad's side.

They care about me and all, and they're my family at the end of the day.I really don't like that my mother throws so much shade at them while being goody-two-shoes in front of all of them.I tried talked to my mom about this the other day and she just....cried. I tried my best to comfort her, but my mom wouldn't stop and just repeatedly discussed how they'd tortured her in the past.AITA for wanting my mom to not hate my paternal side?

This has been very tough for her and has taken a toll on her mental health and body image. However, my older daughter Tomie (16) thinks its acceptable to continue to style and curl her hair whenever she goes out, which obviously would make ella feel bad.Yesterday she was going out to a party with a friend and i caught her styling her hair in front of the mirror, she and ella share a room so ella can see all the hair products in the drawers and sometimes laying about. I told tomie to cut it out and to have some empathy for her sister and she argued back, questioning me on \"why shouldn't she be able to style her hair just because her sister can't?\" I got furious and told her to stop being selfish and just because Ella doesn't say anything doesn't mean it doesn't hurt. Tomie refused to listen and said that she couldn't just go to the party with her hair half-styled and looking like rubbish so I told her that if her hair matters so much then she can forget about her stupid party.My husband found out about this and claimed I was \"making an issue\" out of nothing and just making Tomie resent her sister. I thought that was dumb because why on earth should Tomie resent her sister when she's suffering so much, and if she does that's disgusting and cruel in my opinion. I mean, obviously it's incredibly selfish of her to prioritise her party and her hair while her sister is going through so much pain so I dont see why what I did was wrong?

I’m pretty sure my coworkers were laughing at me because all the other wives were socializing and she was just sitting on a corner.When we got home I told her that her habit of putting aside everything to fixate on this hobby was not sustainable. I explained that as my wife she has responsibilities beyond simply finishing her chores ahead of time and that I can’t keep going to social events either alone or with a disengaged wife. I even payed for babysitters so I told her she needed to grow up and read like normal people do in blocks of time, but she got really offended and said that I don’t have a right to tell her what to do with her weekends, which I think is ridiculous because I’m her husband and I shouldn’t have to beg for some kind of attention from my own wife.",

Instead, she set it on the table and used the blunt end of a table knife to whack around its lid a few times.  She then picked it up and opened it, no problem.  We'd all watched this deft performance, and I said  (at least, this is what I remember saying) \"You see, son, this is a woman's way to open the jar.  Worked great.  If you or I had tried that, we probably would have broken it.\"  (you have to understand, her whacks weren't simple taps).  I was going to say more, but my daughter immediately got offended.  She claimed my remark was misogynistic.  Surprised, I said it certainly wasn't, and that I was picturing my son or myself straining to open the jar -- our manhood on the line!This was all supposed to be a joke at my son and my expense (and the time I'd tried tapping the lid to open it, it didn't work, so I'd tapped harder until by the time I could get it open, the mouth of the jar had actually cracked).  But my daughter said my remark sure sounded misogynistic.  \"Who here thinks that sounded misogynistic?\" she asked.  All four of them raised their hands.This hurt, because I felt they should all know me well enough not to interpret it that way, and it immediately made me wonder if I'd said it differently than I'd thought, or worse, that even knowing me, they thought I was a misogynist.  I tried to explain more, but I was a little flustered because I was pretty surprised at how the conversation was going and felt defensive.  No good.  My daughter expected an apology.At this point I was annoyed and a bit offended.  \"Apologize for what?  For you misinterpreting what I said?  Don't you think you should have let me finish what I was saying before assuming the worst?  It seems to me that's your problem, not mine.  Who's more at fault, a people who say things badly or people who don't work hard enough to try to understand what they're trying to say?\"She said \"See, that's what's wrong with people these days, they say or do something wrong and instead of apologizing they double down and blame everybody else\", and got up and left the table.I can see her point, but I can see mine too.  I see public figures bending over backwards to apologize for things they said that others interpreted in the worst possible way, and it bothers me that they should be held hostage that way.  On the other hand, I see public figures (one in particular) who say offensive things and when called on it, double down to make it even more offensive, and that bothers me just as much or more.What do you think?

The sister herself is named after that same grandmother. My SIL does not have a great relationship with my husband and me. On the day of my wedding, she was visible pregnant and as many family members hadn’t previously known she was, it was heavily talked about, which I found quite upsetting.When my son (3M) was born we made a point to give him a name that did not have any relation to either of our families. However, I knew since before my husband and I got married that if I had a daughter, I wanted to give her a particular name. I was distraught on the day my niece was born and we found out threw my FIL that they had given her the name I had already chosen.The next week when we were able to visit the baby, I mentioned to SIL that I had really liked that name and inquired if she would change it. She laughed thinking I was joking but I told her I was serious and that I would really appreciate if she would change it. She didn't even consider it and told me no. We ended up leaving not long after because I was quite upset. My husband texted her after we left telling her it was rude of her to not consider what we were asking. She never replied but my husband got into an argument with their older brother a few days later about it and told us we were being weird to even ask, especially because we didn't know if we would have a daughter. He apparently also made a comment about my age and how I shouldn’t have any more kids (I was 40 with my first).Our daughter was born a few months ago. After we found out she would be a girl we went back and forth about what we should name her. In the end we knew we had to do what felt right and give her the name we wanted. We kept this a secret from my husband’s family until the day after she was born. My FIL seemed a little shocked we had still picked that name but didn't really say much about it. My BIL called us disrespectful to give our daughter the same name. He said not only was it harsh on SIL but also both the girls. He thinks we are assholes, although his wife has been more supportive of our choice and understands/doesn't think it will be a big issue. My husband and SIL aren't close, and we only see them a few times a year at family gatherings.The big issue is that they actually have the same surname.

She has since changed her surname and that of her son.

I couldn't sleep so I waited for him and he just got to bed without even changing his clothes or taking his shoes off, I asked him why he came back so late, and told him that if I would be the one coming home at that time we would turn crazy about it and definitely not happy (one time I went out with a friend and came back home at 8pm and he was kinda upset about it, texting several times asking if I would get home soon) He just said \"that's why I want you to go with me when I go out so you don't get mad\" and felt asleep.

It was weird, maybe it was triggered by something else.Yesterday I met with my friends Ava (28F), Jessica (31F) and Lucas (31M) at Jessica’s place. We’ve all known each other for a year.None of us is a smoker, but I smoke a couple of cigarettes from time to time, very rarely. I hadn’t smoked one in over 2 years, actually. I asked Jessica if I could smoke and everyone told me to please go on the balcony.While I was smoking, I was standing between the balcony door and the living room so I could also talk to my friends and hear what they say. Some smoke inevitably got into the room.Ava has been suffering from migraines for a long time and her triggers are unclear, it’s mostly genetic. She mentioned periods, stress and smoke to be her main triggers. She said she didn’t have a problem in the past, but nowadays she can’t even walk behind someone who smokes on the street. She takes medication, though. We knew all of this in advance because there were situations when Ava had to go to the ER because of migraines.Well, it seems like my smoking triggered a migraine and she ended up throwing up in the bathroom before the medication kicked in. She was clearly upset when she went home but then she felt better.Now, everyone’s blaming me because I could have just stood further away on the balcony or not smoked at all. I disagree, it was literally 3 minutes and almost no smoke got into the apartment, plus Ava could have just gone to the bathroom or to another room. What does she do when people smoke around her in restaurants (outdoors) or on the street?AITA?",

	"body" : "Me and my fiance are having a destination wedding in Bali next week. We got engaged at the start of 2022 and started wedding planning almost immediately. We lived in Melbourne and all of our closest friends and family were people from there. At the end of 2022 my fiance got an unexpected job offer in Perth that was really good money so we moved over. By the time we settled, we had already booked our dream venue and sorted guest accomodation.We didn't know many people in Perth so the people we became friends with were mostly my fiance's colleagues and their partners. I became especially close with three ladies, Jane, Melisa, and Kate. In the meantime, I received notice from a few of my invited guests that they would not be able to make it, so the cards fell perfectly for me to invite my three friends and their partners. They were all really looking forward to it and told me they would attend.Guest accomodation needed to be confirmed 6 weeks in advance, and final numbers for the actual ceremony/reception 4 weeks in advance.Around 12 weeks before the wedding I found out that Kate was pregnant. She had told me previously she would come, but she hadn't formally RSVPd while Jane and Melisa had. I asked her if she was still attending and she told me that she was still suffering from morning sickness despite being halfway through her pregnancy, so she would let me know closer to our wedding date to see if she was feeling better by then.In the meantime, my fiance had become really close to one of his colleagues, John, and wanted to invite him and his partner. We didn't have anymore space at the guest accom but they were happy to sort out their own accom so they could attend.About a week before the RSVP date Kate was supposed to fly back home to spend the holidays with her family. However, her sickness was still really bad so she opted to stay and spend the holidays here instead. That was a much shorter flight then it would be to Bali so if she couldn't handle that, I doubted she would be able to attend our wedding. So I made the decision to offer John and his partner their guest accom so they wouldn't have to pay for their own.I told Kate what I was going to do and wished her all the best with her health and her pregnancy, and told her that if she was feeling better closer to the day she could still attend the wedding, and that we could even cut the RSVP time to two weeks before the date, but they would have to sort their own accom. She was very upset and told me how rude it was to make the decision for her before the RSVP date, and that even if she couldn't make it her partner would have gone.I get where she is coming from, but it was quite obvious that she wouldn't have been well enough to come, and she all but confirmed that in our last conversation. My fiance isn't that close to her partner so it makes more sense for him to have John there instead if Kate couldn't come, since he was much closer to him. So AITA?",

I could tell mom was completely overwhelmed (plus she has a bad back) with the disabled child, she is strong and needs constant supervision and the 3 year old was being a naturally curious 3 year old and touching/getting into things and mom really had a time handling a small child and profoundly disabled child all by herself and her 12 year old was just tuning everything out playing on her phone, even when her 3 year old sister wanted attention she shooed her away. I felt really bad for the mom so I (politely and gently) told her it would be very kind of her to help mom out and give her a break, she rolled her eyes and said \"I'm their sister not their parent\" and stormed off back to the car. Mom apologized (clearly embarrassed) but also thanked me bc she could really use the extra help.At the end of the day I was telling  a colleague about this and they said the 12 yr old was right and I shouldn't have said that, and they shouldn't have had more kids than they can handle.

The kids slept all in this really big cabin, boys on one side, girls on the other (but all in one room). Kids were in bunks but they were short one so my daughter volunteered to sleep on the floor. Now she had her sleeping bag and they gave her a foldable foam mattress so she was fine enough it seemed. Now I get things happen, not mad really that they made her sleep on the floor in isolationWhat I am mad about is that no boy volunteered or was asked to do that instead. It is basic decency for a boy to yield to a girl and if resources are not enough to give priorities to the girls. Girls have to go through so much more, especially physically so boys yielding comfort to them is basic decency.Anyway I found out about this when the head camp counsellor (F21) offered me a partial credit for future activities run by the organization and praised my daughter for \"taking the initiative\" and volunteering to sleep on the floor. I asked if anyone else volunteered they replied in the negative. I then asked if they asked a boy to take her spot. The counsellor give me a weired look and said so they did not, my daughter volunteerd so there was no need to ask anyone. I told her that girls should not be asked to sacrifice comfort for boys and that a boy should have been asked to volunteer this. She got annoyed at me, and told me that I was \"stuck in the past\". I told her exasperatedly that \"basic respect and courtsey does not change; it is a matter of equity\" but she just ignored me.ETA; Non-profit org ran the camp; overbook was an honest mistake, know enough about org to attest that",

We arrive say hi to everyone and we ask where is Marcus and his wife \"Lindsay\" says he's outback still grilling. I walk out back to say hi and he is surprisingly shirtless. Granted it was 95 degrees in the shade that day, so I get it but still. He had a major glo up. He had lost 40 lbs. He had muscle definition, etc. I embarrassed myself. I went to hug him and he just fist bumped me, \"I'm sweaty\". And I said \"I don't care\" and hugged him anyway. I told him he looked great and left it at that. He didn't seem uncomfortable.When he came inside after he had finished grilling everything, he stopped at the fridge for a drink where I was talking to Lindsay. He totally caught me checking him out, and borderline sprinted upstairs joking to his wife, \"I think I'm indecent\". So here's where I may have messed up just a bit. I asked \"When did Marcus become gorgeous\". I expected playful banter with my SIL, who I've known for 15 years. Nope. She said he always has been and called me a \"little shallow for just noticing now\". I don't want him, trust me. But her saying that made me subconsciously pay him more attention.Add in the fact that I had already pregamed before we got there and drank a lot of wine while there. Honestly though, it should be really no big deal. Marcus always seemed a little unsure of himself physically, so what is wrong with a little confidence overload?

Both my wife and I are Indian-americans, we both were born in the U.S. but our parents emigrated here from India. We met in college, didn't really date in the traditional way but we were pretty good friends and then after our college and I got settled, through the encouragement of both of our parents we decided to get married. Yes I know it's pretty weird from a Western perspective, and looking back on it, I regret it mainly because we didn't get to have the chance to have important conversations about faith. It was merely enough that we liked each other and that our families had the same caste and our horoscopes matched. I do wish either one of us was a bit more strong willed and talked about it without our parents in the room, but at the time we just went along with it with our parents' gentle forcing.We both were brought up in Hindu families but in college I converted to Islam. I took the shahada because I was lonely and felt isolated from the practice of Hinduism, I didn't feel a connection to God and I honestly felt I was running through the motions, practicing loosely related customs and doing pujas that taken all together seemed connected in one faith but I didn't feel it. I then explored other religions and found Islam.The problem is that my parents and her parents would absolutely flip out. My wife is not super Hindu, like I'd say she is culturally hindu but not really in the ideology of fully believing in the Gods. But we started to talk about names, and we are having a problem, she wants a Hindu name, but the idea just kind of turns me off since it's not my religion and I want to name my son a name from our faith. I want our baby to have an Islamic name,. But I can't really say that, so I've been suggesting American names under the pretext that our kid will have an easier time not getting bullied by having an ethnic name, so I said since we both are basically Americans having spent all our life here, it's not that big of a deal, but she disagrees with me. We are having a lot of tension due to this so I'm considering just spilling the beans, but I know she'll tell her parents and they will say that I cheated their daughter and didn't represent myself properly and that I trapped her by not saying I wasn't hindu. I don't think I am the asshole though because my wife isn't particularly religious so I don't think she would mind as much but at the same time I'm worried she'll be mad because I'm concealing something this big from her, and I'm losing sleep over this.",

For my birthday this year, she organized a dinner with my family for which she cooked a dish from her home country and made a home-made cake, plus she handled the shopping all on her own - all of this took two+ days of preparation. She also organized a surprise weekend trip to a city I've been wanting to visit.For her birthday, I wanted to organize a trip to a city famous for the Christmas markets, which she loves, but it ended up being too expensive. So I decided to make it up by preparing a homemade advent calendar for her, I bought some little presents for each day and prepared some riddles for them to find them around the house. She was very happy and grateful.The fight happened on her birthday (4th December). Her parents were visiting so she asked me a week before if I wanted to go to the restaurant or if I wanted to have dinner at home, and I obviously said I'd cook for them since she did the same for me. I was supposed to go to the office so she planned to spend the day with her parents. I ended up having to stay home so I could go buy some ingredients that were missing. She texted me all morning but I only managed to answer at 3.30pm since I was busy with work, and told her I decided to work from home in the end. She stayed with her parents and 5.30pm asked me if it was OK if she came over with her parents a bit earlier or if I preferred for them to come directly at dinner (8pm).That's when I got annoyed: she had no intention of helping me cleaning up the house, she left dirty dishes in the sink (it was her turn to do the dishes) so she was forcing me to do them for her (because of course I wasn't going to make her wash dishes on her birthday in front of her parents) and she had zero plan for the day, just fluttering around with her parents and not thinking about anything. She knew I was stressed out and wanted to make things perfect and she just added stress on top by telling me she would come earlier with her parents.I told her this by text so she left her parents at their hotel and came back home but she ended up making a scene and crying. From her POV, she didn't make me touch any dirty dishes on my birthday so I'm supposed to do the same for her (everything HAS to be exactly equal with her) and I got angry and made her cry on her birthday. Her parents had been to our place two nights before so they knew what to expect and there was nothing to clean anyway. From my POV, I was trying to plan a perfect night for her and she just up and left and left me to deal with everything. I did wash the dishes in the end and I was planning to from the beginning but I'm annoyed that I was forced to do so.

She said she started using when she was 13. And at that point although she had been clean for a year, it was something she very much still struggled with. She told me that while my body is my own, that if I chose to get high she couldn’t be around me while I did it, and was also not in a place to take care of me during or after and it’s likely that anything like that will always trigger her to a degree. I told her that I smoke several times a week (3-4) and she said that she didn’t want to be around me at those times, which is fine since we lived separately. So for a few hours 3-4 times a week I would not be with or be in contact with her.Yesterday after a long day I was going to smoke some to blow off some steam in our bedroom while I played some games. She walked in and freaked out saying that I can’t do that in our room. I told her I was stressed and that I needed to relax and I can do it in my own bedroom if I want. She told me that she was also stressed because her job is extremely stressful (she is CCO of a local popular organisation) and she doesn’t want to come home to being triggered because the smell clings to the bedding. I told her it’s not my problem if she’s triggered by a little smoking, it’s not like it’s hard drugs and she knew I did this before we moved in together and I won’t stop for her. She said that she’s not asking me to stop, but she assumed that I’d have the decency to either continue when she’s not home or do it in the man cave she let me set up in her garage and that it doesn’t matter what it is, that all things of that type are still a trigger for her and she’s always made that extremely clear.

I happened to be on the phone.Suddenly, a truck pulled up next to me, and the woman motioned for me to stop and come around to her window. The interaction went something like this:\"Is this yours\" as she shook the dog poop bag in my face.\"Uh, maybe. It looks like my bags.\"\"Don't throw your dog's shit in my trash can. That it so unbelievably rude. I don't shit in your trash can. It's so disrespectful for you to think that leaving this in my trash can is okay.\"I hadn't taken my headphone out before walking to her window, so while I was talking to her, the person I was on the phone with was also talking. There was so much going on, I was having a hard time processing the already ridiculous situation.I was truly stunned. She handed me the poop bag (along with a questionable paper towel) and I took it out of reflex. I sincerely apologized and she drove away. It was such a strange interaction, I didn't know what else to do.Here's the thing, though - it was trash day. Her trash can was on the curb. I didn't go out of my way to find her bin, and the poop would have been in there for 4 hours max before the truck came to empty it.So, did she see me put the poop bag in there, and then jump in her car to chase me down? She found me like 5 minutes later, so she really committed to this bit.Was this rude? It's not a huge deal to me to just carry the poop bags somewhere else,  and in the future, I won't use her trash can, obviously. But what's the consensus?Edit:: Consensus is that I'm the AH.

In school, he cry every day, because he has a bad grade, or because he got hurt, or because he didnt understand something.Its annoying because he has everything to be happy. He show him love with my husband, he have toys and video games, we make him subscribe to a basketball club, at school he has good grades, and he isnt even getting bullied according to his teacher. But he still cry for everything.He is scared of dogs, water, insects etc... he has also self esteem issues. He says he is ugly, or bad at something, without even trying. I understand that sometimes it can be hard so i try to give him compliments to raise his confidence.His drawing aren't bad, and yesterday he was drawing something and i tell him his drawing was good in hope of him being more confident. HE CRIED. I didnt even know why he cried, he just destroyed his drawing muttering he didnt deserve compliments.It was clearly too much, he didnt have any reason to cry. I told him to stop being a crybaby because he will never be an adult if he keeps crying like that. I know it could sound harsh, but thats the truth and i hope it made him realize his attitude. But im guilty because i feel i should have use better words. I basically let my resentment talk and i was harsh to him. But i think it was the best thing to do becaude he cant continue to be like that. Im feeling guilty right now because this morning i bring him to school and he cried without reasons in the car.

She said she wasn't comfortable with that as I was recovering from my C - section, I wasn't in condition to do such a long hike and also had a 1 month old.I sort of pressed that I wanted to go, but agreed the trail wasn't the best and I had found friendlier trails that would work for me.Once my husband and I realized we didn't like the idea of him being alone with our child for so long, I told my friend with everything going on maybe it would be best if we made it a family vacation and push up intense hiking next year.

Her parents grew up in South Asia and left before they had the kids and spent their whole professional life in academic English-speaking environments.Our kids and I have no relationship to the language or culture of my in-laws. My wife has only been there once, as baby, and although we both like travelling and speak several languages, we both don't intend to ever go there.We recently visited my in-laws and I noted that my wife and her mum spoke an unusual high amount of the language of my in-laws. My wife learnt this language when she grew up but it had always been a habit that they speak in English when I am there. (She and her siblings talk in English to each other unless they don't want people to understand what they say.)When we left I told my wife it's very rude to not talk in English to her mum in front of me. She told me I don't get to tell her in what language she talks to her mum (in front of me).AITA?Update since this was not clear: I assume their conversation was about me and the kids, as they would normally talk in English.Thanks a lot for your comments. Some of you helped me to see what my problem was. My wife suffered quite a bit through her parents' culture (shaming) and I connect the language with it. In a way my behaviour is indeed controlling as I don't want her to be back to this bad place (figuratively). But trying to tell her what language to speak does not get us anywhere.

The dynamic with her and my boyfriends family is confusing to say the least.Serena worked with Connor and they became good friends and connor introduced her to his family and she met Kyle. They dated for a few months and broke up. I don’t have info because I didn’t really care to understand the situation.I guess everything ended amicably because there is no bad blood between Kyle and Connor, and the family still loves her. I personally think she’s absolutely unbearable and annoying in every way possible.Last night we were all hanging out at Kyle’s family home, with his family. I don’t remember what led to the conversation but Serena was asking Kyle if he could beat Connor at arm wrestling, Kyle of course said he could.Then Serena loudly yelled across the room to Connor, “Kyle says he’s stronger then you and can beat you at arm wrestling”, everyone found this funny and made Kyle and Connor arm wrestle. Kyle won, and Serena announced that it was her turn to arm wrestle Kyle. She did and Kyle let her win. She got up and announced that since she beat Kyle she was obviously stronger then Connor since Kyle beat Connor.Everyone thought this was funny, laughed and moved on. She was later talking to Kyle and I interjected myself because I was not okay with her talking to him. She was talking about how happy she was that he let her win because Connor never lets her win at arm wrestling so now she has finally beat him. Kyle laughed and said he was happy to oblige. Then she went on to happily sit on Connors lap and joke with everyone the rest of the night.This honestly pissed me off, the fact she’s just so annoying but everyone just plays into it. So I thought it would be funny to call her out, indirectly of course since she hates confrontation.As everyone was playing a drinking game the conversation of how many kids everyone wanted came up. Connor and Serena were being super gross and talking about how they want a big family and Connor stated how good Serena is with kids and how nice it would be to see her with their own kids some day. Everyone chimed in about how great Serena is with kids and how cute their family would be. So I chimed in and said “of course Serena is great with kids since she acts like a child herself, I think it’s going to be a while till you two have kids since she has to grow up first.”No one laughed and Connor asked me to clarify what I meant, and Kyle told me what I said was unwarranted. Me and Kyle left after that and he told me that I was an asshole for saying what I did. But I think Kyle’s being the asshole for taking his ex girlfriend’s side. So Am I the asshole?TDLR; My boyfriends brother’s girlfriend was being immature so I called her out for it, AITA?Edit: everyone keeps saying I’m jealous. To clarify I thought calling her out would embarrass her, but for her own good. She needs to be more self conscious so she doesn’t act the way she does.

I have always looked much younger than my actual age and used to like to tell people how old I really was for the shock value and also for the boost to my self esteem, but I stopped doing this around 35 when I was no longer passing for 22 anymore lol.  In the past year I’ve noticed that despite still looking really good for my age that I am starting to look closer to the age I really am (blame 3 kids, full time job and buckets of stress!).  For some reason turning 40 is not setting well with me and so I’ve just chosen to ignore this birthday, I do not want to celebrate it or acknowledge it - and I thought my husband understood this but apparently I was mistaken.The other night we were returning from a concert with friends and one of his male friends out of nowhere asked me my age.  I tried skirting the question and tried getting out of answering with humor - I jokingly scolded him by saying “you never ask a lady her age”, and when he said he meant no disrespect but that he assumed I am probably close to his age (he is 34).  Before I could say something so end the questioning my husband turns to this man’s wife and announces that I will be 40 at the end of the month.I was pissed and mortified!  Not only did he not take my cues of not saying my age, he informs not only this man but also his gossip queen wife (who is still a spring chicken in her 20’s) of my age!  I got mad at him, which in turn he got mad at me and now I’m questioning am I the asshole?  I am not the only women who lies about their age, and definitely not the only one sensitive about it and especially when it is the dreaded big 4-0!!!  He does not understand the concept of this and thinks I’m crazy for being pissed off - while I think he’s an idiot for not realizing that based on my answers to the question that I wanted it to be a secret!!!  He doesn’t think he did ANYTHING wrong in this situation.Side argument:  he also thinks that I don’t want people to know my actual age because then I won’t be considered attractive to them.  I admitted that this is true, and that subconsciously everyone wants to be considered desirable to which he thinks I should not want or try to be desirable to anyone but him.  I am quiet and reserved and not flirty or flaunting so I’m not looking for attention from others, but I do care about how I look and work hard to look good - if I look good I feel good.  This kind of makes me wonder if he purposely wants to sabotage my self esteem….  And yes, I have struggled with self esteem issues my entire life - and being with my husband for 22 years he is aware of this (a lot of my issue over getting older is growing up in a male dominated atmosphere - 5 brothers so I have heard my share of disgusting conversations and comments about women, though my brothers are especially repulsive and I hope they do not represent the majority of men with their opinions).

She also needed to save up money for a car, which she has now and bought it herself for $10K. I haven’t had a job until this year, so she has also been responsible for the rent, which is $680 right now. And I believe her car insurance is $375 and her phone bill is $40.She’s been working at a restaurant since a month before her graduation, and she still works there today. She recently got promoted so she got another raise, she works 30-35 hours a week. I don’t get much money anymore because I can’t claim her as a dependent, I made almost $5,000 when she was a dependent, but because of her age and she isn’t a student I no longer get anything.

She was already sheltered for 2 years with the 2 years of high school being robbed from her, I don’t think she understands or has any idea what her best interest is. She also just recently lost her state health insurance because she makes too much at her job, which was $23K a year last year. And now ever since she got promoted she got more hours, if she goes to school however, then she can limit her availability so she will make less, she needs to make less than $17K to get the free insurance back.

I told her she is making things needlessly complicated, she argued that I was cool with it and referenced me saying so, I don’t remember ever saying that. And now, if she makes too much she probably won’t get good financial aid either. I tell her to listen to me and stop doing things the hard way. Now she wants to drop school altogether. She cannot work the same hours she is working and go to school, I don’t care if she has to lie to her manager, just change her availability to get her income down and attend school, it is that simple. She argues that her coworkers and even managers attend school online and work the same hours she does, and “why can’t I”. She has shut me out and always does the opposite of what I say because she has some dedication to this job, she doesn’t need to work so much and make a lot of money. I want her to meet people and have the college experience in school, online community college classes won’t give her that. Sure, she meets people at work but I mean in a different environment. I want her to do in-person classes.",

Now, the house we lived in before was on a busy road where it wasn't safe to ride a bike, so we didn't have one. Now that they can have one, they're curious about them and I had been planning on getting the boys their own bike and scooter for the holidays. So, it's not uncommon for the kids to take a toy out of one of their yards (whether they live there or not) and then return them. On this particular day, my two were outside and took a bike and scooter to try out. The mother of the kids living in this house sent me footage of the boys taking these items and then returning them. The front wheel of the scooter was broken and she claimed they couldn't find the bike. My husband went over to their house and was able to fix the wheel of the scooter in less than 5 minutes. I talked to my oldest and asked him about the bike and he had told me he returned it, but saw another kid he didn't know take it and ride it. We did still look all over the neighborhood for the bike and we couldn't find it either. My husband and I did talk to the boys (5 and 7) about this and told them that, while we know they tried to return it, they're not to take anything from anyones yard again. They had not done anything like this before and they understood and haven't done anything like this since. A couple of days later, the mother came knocking on my door demanding I either replace the bike or pay her for it. I explained to her that the video she sent me clearly showed my kids returning the bike and scooter and that we had already fixed the scooter and helped look for the bike, but I am not responsible if another kid took the bike after my kid returned it. She insisted I am and that I need to replace it or reimburse her for its value. I refused and told her that I took responsibility for my kids actions to the best of my ability. The bike was returned right to where it was found (the middle of her yard). Why is she not looking for the other kid who took her son's bike after mine returned it? She left in a huff, mumbling something.My husband thinks we should go and find a cheap bike and take it to them to keep the peace. Quite frankly I'm kindof frustrated and really don't see why we should. I corrected my kids to the best of my ability for their actions.

	"body" : "This happened about a month ago on a very frigid February morning.My daily commute has me leaving an apartment complex with a left turn onto a main roadway. The speed limit in the area is 30 mph (50 km/hr) and the roadwa has one of those center-turn lanes.One morning, looking towards the left to determine when I could properly turn onto the roadway, I saw what appeared to be a mother and a very young daughter, posssibly close to age four. They darted across the same roadway, not in the safest place (no cross walk). But I'm not one to judge due to how far away the nearest striped cross walks happen to be relative to their location, and one would be a backtrack.Before I could turn left myself, I saw them nearly sprinting in the same direction I would be heading. I did have a bit of wait due to traffic.As I eased into the roadway, I realized that there was a bus stop maybe a furlong or so (about 200 metres) down the roadway. I eased into my travel lane and noted an Express Bus behind me that would stop there. I reasoned that the two were desperately trying to get to the stop in time to catch that bus. The young girl had to stop running every now and then due to her youth.I then decided to help them the best I could, and slowed to about 15 mph (25 km/hr) which again was half the speed limit. There wasn't much traffic so the bus could have easily passed the stop if they weren't there, but by intentionally driving slowly, the two were close enough to the stop for the bus to stop for them.I did have one driver behind me beep his horn at me  and there may have been one more vehicle between me and the bus. But as soon as I got past the intersection for the stop, I assumed my typical rate of speed, that being 35 mph (58 km/hr). Yes that's about 30/50, but I wasn't going to hold anyone up any further. I feel that speed traps won't stop for only five/eight over. I hadn't traveleed more than 2/10 of a miel (325 metres), before assuming \"traffic\" speed.Was I an asshole to the unknown number of vehicles ultimately slowed down/delayed by my action?",

We both shopped around for various dealerships and found one with a make/model that I wanted to buy.On Saturday we went to the dealership planning on pulling the trigger on the car. I was introduced to a saleswoman named Claire. Claire was extremely professional and answered all of our questions about the car, but only to Jen. I would ask her something and she'd answer to Jen. Everything she said was said looking at Jen. I first gently reminded her that I was the one who would be buying the car, but she just kind of said \"Oh OK\" and continued exactly what she was doing.What irritated me the most was when Claire offered to let us (well, Jen) to go for a short test drive. We took her up on the offer. When I was trying to climb into the driver's seat she said, \"Oh, I thought Jen was driving?\" I reminded her, for the third time by that point, that I was the person who would be buying the car. Maybe I said it a bit strongly because the test drive was a bit awkward.When we got back I told Claire that I'd have to think about it a bit. Jen was surprised and asked me why, to which I responded I just wanted to make sure I was getting the best deal.On Sunday, when Jen was out, I went to a different dealership. The make/model I wanted was in a different color and had a few fewer miles on it, but it was at first $1300 more. The salesman, however, was worlds better than Claire. He treated me with respect. When I told him about the price at the other dealership, he was able to knock $400 off.

I did that today, and as I usually do, I dropped it in the nearest house's easily-available trash can (sitting in the driveway). I have done this many times, and nobody has ever said a thing to me.Today, as I was walking back to the sidewalk (a journey of roughly 10 meters), the owner of the house returned in their vehicle and asked if I had put dog poop in their trash can. I said yes, not thinking anything of it. This person proceeded to tell me that THEY didn't have a dog, and THEY didn't want my dog's poop in their trash can, and to never do that again. I was blown away. I have known this person for essentially my entire life, as I grew up two houses down the street from this person. They didn't recognize me (I have recently lost significant weight), but even when I told them who I was, they remained adamant that this was offensive and that I was never to do it again. I replied that it was better than leaving the poop on their grass, but they were not swayed.Reddit, I have always considered this to be part of the social contract; I bag and remove my dog's poop, and you allow me to put the bagged poop in your trash can.

I decided to sign up for the presale code myself just to give me the option of going if i decided I wanted to. When the day came for tickets to be bought, my girlfriend, along with all of her friends, did not end up with tickets. Somehow I was able to score two tickets in a relatively nice section close to the stage. I joked with her that I planned to resell the tickets instead of letting her buy them off of me and she did not find it funny at all, even starting a small fight over it.When I checked the resale values, just out of curiosity, I was very surpised. I found out  that I could likely resell my tickets for around $3,000. When I told my girlfriend this, she told me that I should be prioritizing her wants over money, and that it would be mean and unfair for me to sell them. To be clear she was not asking me to give her the tickets, only sell them to her for the original price. I told her that I would end up spending the money on her anyways and that it would end up being more value than one concert. She got very mad at me and has seemed distant for the past day or so. I dont understand why she is so mad considering I worked hard to get the tickets and the money would end up going to her anyways. I cant tell if my opinion is just biased because i'm thinking about the 3k. Should I have sold her the tickets?",

	"body" : "AITA for considering taking my children’s grandparents to court for maintenance ?So long story short, my children’s father passed away in late 2019 leaving me to look after 2 babies (my oldest turned 1 a week after he passed and I was 6 months pregnant with my youngest). My oldest turned 5 now and youngest will be 4 in January.I wasn’t working at the time so his parents let me stay there with the kids until I got a job again in February 2021. His father had me and the kids put onto a medical aid in 2020 since they could no longer be on their dads, which he still pays for. I moved out a few months later but gave money every month for letting us stay there.They also let me use her old car.In 2022 after moving out a child psychologist recommended I put my oldest into a school, my salary at the time was not very big and on children’s grandmother’s recommendation (after me explicitly telling them that I could not afford it) my son was enrolled into a very costly private pre-primary school. I only paid a portion (just under half) of his school fees. This year my other son had to join the same school and I contribute about 1/3 to the fees. The school recommended my child do sports as he is extremely busy and struggles with impulse control, I pay all his extra murals myself. The kids stay with me permanently and see their grandparents almost once every weekend because I am not trying to be a horrible “ex” and a firm believer that they are still family. I got married in September 2023.It came out that my oldest son has been overexposed to age inappropriate content on YouTube at the grandparents house. The school has been trying to help with the kids by means of a round table discussion and sending both of them to OT on their account but it’s still occurring. The school then recommended I send my oldest for an emotional evaluation at a psychologist who stated she recommends ds my children go to after care to create a more stable routine and less of being given a phone without supervision.This is an expense I just can’t incur because ase of finances so I sent the details to the grandparents with the aim of having a discussion about it when we discuss 2024 school fees. The grandfather calls me and argues with me that my husband and I need to make a plan because he can’t keep paying for everything (he still pays my medical aid and contributes to the kids school but also his 25 year old daughters and gives her a monthly allowance and she wants to get married in Thailand in March) because he needs to plan for his old age.

Although her pregnancy has gone really well so far, she is drained physically and I am drained mentally.I have picked up extra shifts at work, doing 12 hour night shifts, so that we are more comfortable financially and so that she has the option to take maternity leave should she wish to without the extra financial stress and worry. She has chose not to take maternity just yet, and still works 9 hours a day, 5 days a week, and plans on doing so right up until her due date. Again, I have stressed to her this is absolutely not necessary and if she feels she would like to finish up work early, she can do so.She told me as long as she feels physically well, she will continue to work, as otherwise she will be sat at home with not much to do. I support her choice.However, I got home from work at 6 am and went to have a shower. It was filled with her hair in the drain where she had not cleaned it out. Slightly frustrating, but, I cleaned it out.I then went into the kitchen after my shower to make something to eat before I went to bed. I needed the cheese grater, but it was sitting in the sink, unwashed along with the other utensils she had used the night before to make herself some food.

I made my food, and then went to bed.Later that evening, I woke up before I had to go back to work that same day, a pair of her shoes were left in the middle of the doorway and I tripped over them. I frustratedly kicked them to the side to which she replied “what’s wrong”. I told her about the three little things and how they were no problem in the grand scheme of things, but I would appreciate it if she tidied up after herself a little bit.She got angry at me and told me she can’t physically bend down to clean the shower drain or pick her shoes up, it hurts her back. I said that’s fair enough, if she needs help, I will do it, but little things build up sometimes and after working for 12 hours, it is a bit frustrating.She told me I am not the only person who works, and reminded me that she is also still working. I told her that is by choice and if she needs to take the time off, she can do just that. Again, I reminded her that she told me she would only work if she was physically able to, and if she is having back troubles, she should really consider a break.She got mad and called me an asshole saying I am throwing it back in her face and that she is trying to help me by working so that the financial issues don’t land on me.

Since my mother has already made all the setup for me, let me elaborate a few things before I get started.My robe is 400 dollars, it's a custom order all-cotton summer robe designed specifically for the sensory feedback of an aspy (me) and has direct instructions from the company I got it from that it cannot be machine washed or dried, it has extremely specific instructions on how to manually wash and air dry it or else it will ruin whatever makes the robe have it's unique touch feedback that I get.She said I threatened to move out, yes I did, I changed my mind.Yes, my girlfriend did fly into town and yell at me about the smell but she's also aware of how the robe requires to be washed.Now then, After I found the post I was angry and annoyed. My mother knows about my preference to not share my information online and made me out to be a slob. My room is extremely well kept where everything should be and vacuum my room twice weekly.I confronted my mother about the post, and she did admit to making the post and then went on to say that the smell was a problem and my girlfriend was placating me so she could be a gold-digger after I married her. Without even acknowledging the comments of my girlfriend being a gold-digger (she's not, she works longer hours than me but was dealt a shitty hand in life) I asked her what made her think it was acceptable to violate my request to not have my personal life aired for thousands or hundreds of thousands of people. She decided to not reply to me and I thought that was the end of it, until I came home after a long day of meetings and other nonsense and she had washed it, improperly, AGAIN. This is the second robe I bought after the first one was ruined and she tried to pawn off a cheap 20$ amazon robe on me as a lame apology. I confronted her about it, and she said that she was putting her foot down about the smell, and reddit empowered her to do what needed to be done. I asked her if she had the light bulb going off before going through with the act to read the instructions provided by the manufacturer and I was told \"Why would I? Just throw it in the washing machine and hit start, who reads the instructions?\", I told her that robe was 400 dollars and I would expect her to pay me back for both of them (I let the first one go, on the advice of my girlfriend and therapist, I don't need the money it's symbolic to send a message) and she called me greedy. That's when I got mad and told her that she needed to respect my stuff that I paid for, and it wasn't her right to \"put her bitch mitts on\" without my permission. Now, I don't swear and I don't like swearing but it came out because I was MAD. She yelled at me for calling her that word and I simply ignored her and went to my room, then locked the door where I am now.This post (reddit fucked it up for some reason)",

Many of our mates know us as a \"unit\" due to this.We both had a uni \"reunion\" last week, where we both attended as we graduated in the same year, although we did different courses. Jess is a very beautiful woman and has always been, I'm an average looking bloke and has always been. So obviously, we had gotten lots of jokes through our relationship about that, I'm not insecure about it as I don't care about my looks that much and it's not like they're calling me ugly anyway, they're just calling her hot.So we're at this reunion and someone brought up how impressive it was that Jess and I are still together, as we're the only couple in my friend group to \"last\". I then made some jokes that are the AITA in the question. I said us boring journos always need a \"side piece\" of a hot woman with leftist politics and the ass of a century. I said I'd never break up with my trophy wife, for example look at (other male journalists and their hot wives) because any time someone wants to criticise me for my journalism, I could put my arms up and say \"hey look, this is my wife, I can't be that much of a scumbag! and use that as a \"shield\".I was being self deprecatory, Jess was known in uni and is known in the local community for being a vocal activist. She works in a national charity and also does a lot of things to help refugees in her day to day life. I'm proud of her for it and it's not like my politics disagree: we both hold the same views. Jess has also started a PhD this month, on a scholarship, so I don't at all think of her as a \"bimbo\", I was simply referring to a common joke in our field that male journalists have sexy wives.Jess wasn't happy with my joke. She told me after the event that she felt undervalued and like her job and activism is a \"joke\" to me. This is not true at all, she makes just a bit more than me with her charity job and her scholarship, so I'd never see her job as a joke. However, she said she didnt appreciate the \"misogyny\" of the comments our friends made in response which I laughed at (had a few bevs). She especially did not like the joke about using me as a \"shield\" because random people have previously attacked her for being with me as her job is so visible.I thought it was just a regular joke in the field, and not something she should take offense at: considering she WORKS WITH REFUGEES she has had to deal with a lot worse comments from the public and should have had thicker skin for this pathetic joke.

And of course I’ve got no problems with the LGBTQ+ community and I wish we could all just get along, but at their young age, I just don’t feel like their “love” is legitimate. They’re children, and they’re just figuring things out. I think their “love” is more of a passing thing, like a phase.Anyway, back in March this year, I was giving Laura a ride somewhere (her father trusts me very much with her safety, which I appreciate), and before she got out of the car, she reached into her bag and she pulled out a very beautiful bookmark. She told me that it was for Noa. I thanked her for it, and I let her know that I’ll give it to Noa when I get home….but when I went home, I didn’t really know what to do with it. I just set it aside, and eventually I forgot about it.A few weeks later, my wife (46F) found the bookmark, and she thought it looked wonderful. She asked me where it came from, and I told her that it was a “gift” to Noa from her girlfriend, except I wasn’t really sure if it was something worth passing along to our daughter. My wife got kind of confused, and she asked me why I didn’t give it to our daughter immediately. So I just told her about my true feelings about Noa’s relationship, and I let her know that I don’t really think of it as anything genuine. When I said this, my wife was horrified, and she just silently walked away. Later on, she gave Noa the bookmark…but she also told her that I have been withholding the gift from her. Noa was heartbroken, and she cried about this whole experience.I didn’t intend to make my daughter cry. Am I the bad guy here?EDITED just so everyone can see here: a commenter asked: \"When you say their love is a passing phase and they’re figuring stuff out do you mean you think your daughter might be too young to know she’s a lesbian?\"Yes, I do believe my daughter is too young to know that she's a lesbian. If she were 20+ or something like that, then I would have no doubts about her sexuality. But right now, she's just a little kid.Second edit to clear things up: Some of you may be wondering why I didn't just give the bookmark to Noa and why her sexuality is relevant at all. And I need to say that Laura's a very polite, intelligent, bright girl, but at that time, I considered her to be sort of a \"bad influence\" on my daughter. And I didn't know if I wanted to pass along a gift that came from a bad influence. It's now been months since the bookmark incident, and I'm still learning to deal with my prejudices, and I want to be more open. But I'm just asking for a little patience.",

She dropped out of college, started dating someone who’s involved in a controversial subculture, and has a seemingly carefree attitude about life.Here’s the issue: she’s become quite vocal about her choices on social media, often sharing controversial opinions and engaging in activities that I find irresponsible. She’s even posted pictures from protests and events I consider too radical. I’m concerned for her future and her safety, but she insists she’s living her truth. This all came to a head when she invited her new boyfriend to a family gathering. He has a reputation in their community, and I didn’t want to expose our family to his lifestyle. I told Lily she needed to disinvite him, which she refused to do. We had a huge argument, and I decided not to attend the event.Now our relationship is at a breaking point. Our parents are also concerned but don’t want to take sides.",

	"body" : "My girlfriend (23F) and myself (36M) and I have an almost 2 year old and we own a house together (we are not married because my girlfriend receives disability and marriage will affect that).My girlfriend is a stay at home mom to our daughter. I work overnight shifts 9pm-5am and I get off Saturdays and Sundays. Our daughter wakes up at around 6am.One thing about my girlfriend is that she loves her sleep. She says that if she does not get enough sleep it makes her mental health symptoms worse and harder to control. “Chronic fatigue” is her favorite thing to say. Reluctantly, we made an agreement that I will stay up until 7:30am after work Tuesday-Friday with our daughter so that my girlfriend can get more sleep. Saturday, Sunday, and Monday she gets up.The problem is that every Saturday she doesn’t stop complaining that she has to get up the next morning. I tell her I am also tired but that doesn’t mean anything to her. I told her just go to bed earlier and she goes on and on about how she gets no time to herself and when she puts our daughter to bed is the only time she gets. I always end up feeling guilty and caving to staying up.I stood my ground today and now she is profusely apologizing to me saying she didn’t mean to put to so much on me and she is just overworked. I don’t know if her apologizing to me is confirmation that I am in the right or if I am just a giant asshole now.",

I didn’t even have time to think when I got the call, I just brought my children to my brother’s home. Not the most ideal because my brother is not responsible with taking care of children, him and his partner don't have any kids themself, but we had to make it work and my brother doesn't work so he has time that our other family does not.Now he’s been calling me constantly wanting to get them off his hands. First he was complaining he didn’t know anything about how to bring them to school, the kids know when school starts they just need to be driven. They can do their own homework. And I’ve told him I’m dealing with an emergency but he can’t make himself understand that. With him it’s only ever about himself… he’s told me numerous times about his flight on Wednesday and is threatening to ABANDON the kids with CPS if I didn’t come and get them… but my husband had MAJOR SURGERY last week! I told my brother he’s constantly in Spain so he can just wait here for a while like an adult where he’s needed, and it’s not like he can’t change his ticket, its such an easy thing to do.He told me that I’m “seriously unhinged” over this! I just don’t see it, how am I in the wrong here? What happened to family sticking together and not leaving each other in their darkest moments?Since you asked my kids are 11, 9, and twins are 7. They are responsible and respectful. They just need an adult present and to drive them to school and activities.Also for those concerned about my kids safety making me out to be a bad mother... my brother would never harm them. He just doesn't have kids so he doesn't understand everything they need. And he has trouble being consistent with going places and canceling plans because he doesn't feel good anymore, that's all.Oh, and it's not a vacation, they live half the year in Spain. So it's ONLY the plane ticket thats needs changed, not like he also has hotel, etc. to move around...For one last time I'll just say this... my husband needs to rest. I did make sure my kids are SAFE so he can rest. I worded myself poorly, it's not as though my brother is a monster, my kids are SAFE and fed and housed... the \"not responsible\" part I meant was my brother can't always get things done and gets easily exhausted with just things like grocery shopping to where he decides he's done for the day. His partner is working from home to help with the kids so it's all worked itself out.",

	"body" : "My parents have offered to pay for me and my son to travel to Maui, but haven’t invited my wife.For context: My wife and I met in the USA 10 years ago and we moved to Australia (she is Australian) just before COVID.During that time we had a son who is now 2, and he hasn’t met my parents in person but they've met a few times via FaceTime.They are pretty absent, hence me being happy to move to Australia. My wife and my parents have a fractured relationship, as do I to a degree. My parents aren’t exactly involved or great communicators, they don’t FaceTime, nor did they call our son or send any card to acknowledge his 2nd birthday, which was 2 weeks ago.My mum has since come up with this idea that it would be great if they could fly myself and my son over to Maui (at their expense cause we can’t afford it) for a week so they can meet our son. My mum is at a conference in Maui with my Dad, and thought it would be great if we could all meet there.More context: my wife is the primary carer for our son and is currently home full time with him whilst I work full time.My wife is upset that I would consider taking him without her and thinks I’m being unreasonable.Her reasons:Our son has never been separated from her for more than a few hours.Our son doesn’t go readily to strangers and whilst my parents are family to me, they are strangers to him.it’s unfair to take him on his first overseas trip without her, she wants us to experience this as a family, together.we are a package deal, it’s all of us or none of us.I’ve never had our son for more than a day on my own, she thinks it’s too much to manage a 2 year old on my own, on his first OS flight and then for a week with people who are strangers to him, with no support. I think my parents will help, she thinks our son will struggle because he doesn’t know them and will want his mum.She is worried he will have separation anxiety and doesn’t want to throw him in the deep end. She would prefer to manage separation by starting slowly, like a day a week at pre school, not a week in a different country without her.she is a first time mum, she flat out does not want our son to go overseas without her.she thinks it’s more reasonable that my parents travel here rather than ask our 2 year old to travel there without her. They are the adults. My Dad has recently had an operation and doesn’t want to do such a long flight.I can’t help but also think, the bigger reason she doesn’t want us to go is because she doesn’t like my parents.Regardless of the strained relationships, I want our son to meet my parents and we can’t afford to go without their help.Am I the asshole for accepting my parents offer, and taking our 2 year old to visit them overseas, without my wife?UPDATE: formatting for ease of reading",

We are both really interested in creative writing, and actually met at a Fiction Writing workshop hosted by our English DepartmentThe difference is that I am more invested in writing mature coming of age family dramas that draw heavily from my personal experiences, so I'd like to say that I put a lot of thought in my writing and my writing involves really deep and meaningful themes, while my girlfriend writes more \"pulpy\" fantasy/sci fi fiction. I'm not really judging her per se, it's just how everyone(including me) sees her writing, but I'm sure she's great at coming up with story ideas because she always has some new fun little twist popping up in her head to the point where she keeps a notebook near the bathroom to write down ideas she gets in the shower, but I'm more deliberate, but each to their own I guess.Anyways, so my girlfriend has finished a first draft of her fantasy novel, she told me it's in the vein of Lord of the Rings. To be quite honest, my memories of high fantasy novels like that one and the Belgariad are a bit hazy, mostly because I outgrew them by the age of 12 because they just seemed a little silly for me, no judgement of course, it's just hard to get invested in such fantastical and at times, whimsical stories about orcs and Mordor.But I wanted to be a supportive partner so I started it, and it was kind of rough. I tend to prefer well fleshed out characters and thoughtful moments of introspection in my writing that really strike a nerve with the reader, but I just saw rambling and extensive descriptions of the landscape and the trees or the chainmail the warriors would wear. But I bore through it and finished half of the novel.That was 2 days ago. Yesterday, my girlfriend hands me a giant stack of loose leaf papers, telling me that apparently she *forgot* to hand me her world building notes, stuff she uses to keep track of all of this, and asked me to reference it as I read.To be quite honest, this was too much to ask. I have my own life and I can't always be at her beck and call, I was fine reading the novel, but I'm just not that into fantasy stuff to cross reference a language bank she created, it's just all a bit dorky for me.I did offer some advice on avoiding purple prose, shortening and making the descriptions a bit more concise to spend some time more on elucidating the mental state of the characters, but she really didn't want to hear it and is now acting kind of weird. I feel like I wasted my time giving feedback to someone who didn't really appreciate it or say thanks, so should I have just told her what she wanted to hear instead?",

We got together when Jo was about 4-5 months, but I’ve known Sadie since a bit before she found out she was pregnant.Anyway. We moved in together over a year ago and Sadie works from home and keeps Jo home with her to save on daycare costs. I work 2 jobs for the time being so I can get my hours up for my certification so I can be eligible to work alone and not under someone. Because of this I am often tired.I never have days off and by time I get home I basically have enough energy to eat dinner and pass out. The whole situation started a while ago when Sadie mentioned she would like to try to go out once or twice a month. I explained i might not be able to commit to that but I’ll try my best.At first it was ok but bringing Jo along with us prolonged the evening often or wasn’t as relaxing as just a date so by the end of the night I was either irritated or more tired than before.We had a talk and Sadie agreed to put Jo in part time daycare so we could have more adult time together. But she only put her in 3 days a week and it’s usually during the times I’m working so when I get home I still don’t have a break or just adult time, but Sadie does.Recently one of her cousins moved close to us and Sadie paid him to watch Jo after hours so we could have a date. I had an amazing time and suggested Jo pulls her from daycare and just has her cousin watch her for date night once in a while.We got into an argument because she feels like I just don’t want to be around Jo and I feel like I should be able to request alone time with my lady away from a child that at the end of the day isn’t my responsibility. Sadie said I knew from day one what I was getting into when pursing her but I feel like I signed up to be with HER not be a replacement dad. I understand Jo will always be there, but Sadie can’t expect me to be happy to see an upset toddler after working 15-18 hours at 2 jobs nearly EVERYDAY and the few times we get to go on a date we have to spend most of dinner making sure Jo doesn’t have a tantrum or is entertained.I love Sadie I really do, but since Jo is hers she should be responsible for finding childcare and making sure we have alone time. I just don’t think I’d push my kid on a partner that didn’t have one. Sadie went to stay with her cousin and has been responding very vaguely whenever I reach out. AITA?",

My brother was the one who introduced us as my fiance was always at our house when they were teens and after they all came back from college.

However, I personally am not comfortable with letting another grown man live in my home while contributing nothing to the world, even if this was the previous arrangement he had with his husband it is not an arrangement he has with me.His response was to claim it would be too much of a burden on him to work outside of the home. I have offered to help him by co-signing on a car, but he has repeatedly refused citing finances are not an issue. Instead, he allows my wife to drive him places. He also claims he cannot work from home because he cannot keep traditional working hours or commit to a set schedule. To him, paying rent to me should be enough. I suspect that in his mind, because of his pension and the money from the sale of his previous property and funds left to him by his late spouse, he doesn't feel a need to work.I expressed to him that I feel it’s time to leave this mindset behind. I am trying to do what is best for him, and after all this is my house and I set the rules I please. After trying to set him straight I told him he needs to get a job or he’s out of my home.

They are now living together it's been a few weeks.Our other friends find this kinda cute since Jamie is so in love. I however have some misgivings.

It was a really nice wedding ceremony and then later on we were sitting at the reception as the wedding party entered.The entrances were like they all were, a little ridiculous and cringey but it is what it is, just your typical wedding entrances. Then the best man and the maid of honor were introduced and in their entrance, the maid of honor twirled the best man and I thought that it was a little weird but just chalked it up to being silly and having fun.Then came the toast from the best man. In the toast, the best man didn’t use a script on his phone and just spoke to everyone, a crowd of 400, which was surprising to me because typically men, at the other weddings that I’ve been to, need some material to go off of and keep their speech going. In the speech, he didn’t really seem to touch on the more masculine things that you typically see in best man speeches but rather on things I thought were more feminine. When he finished the speech, he went directly in for a hug with the groom rather than a typical handshake or whatever else guys do.All of this and plus how much it seemed he cared about his appearance led me to say to the girl next to me; “That was a good speech and all but do you think that he is bisexual?”She responded, “Well that is his fiancé right there” as she pointed across the table to a girl, to which I then turned to her and asked the same thing, if he was bisexual.She looked confused and said, “No” to which I responded “Are you sure?”The girl next to the best man’s “fiancé”, immediately responded, “Well I am his (the best man’s) sister and I think I would know if he was.” And it turns out that I was at a table with many of the groomsmen’s plus ones and some of their family members. I took the hint to change the subject but it seemed like it was a touchy subject for some reason.The night went on and apparently word had gotten back to the groom’s family, my boyfriend is the groom’s uncle, and the grooms’s family was upset with the comments that I made, as it turns out the best man is really close to their family and felt embarrassed that someone would say this to him and some thought I should apologize to the best man and his fiancé for continuing to press questions. But I felt it was a valid question that I was curious about and even tried to defend it more by saying he seemed to care too much about his appearance and that he danced with a bunch of people and not just his fiancé throughout the night (not grinding or anything but just didn’t have his full attention on only dancing with his fiancé).This has caused a small strain in my relationship with my boyfriend because his family is upset with me but I don’t think it is valid.

I currently live in a city where there is projected to be a hurricane tomorrow, as well as a storm surge and flooding, at varying degrees of intensity for almost 24 hours. The power is very likely to go out. This means that I won’t be able to go outside from late tomorrow morning to Sunday, with probably at least half a day with both no power and the storm hitting at the same time. My partner chose tomorrow to go on a camping trip without cell service.I let him know that I’m upset that he is going tomorrow because it makes me feel like he doesn’t care to check in on me or care very much about my comfort (or to see if I’m safe but I didn’t mention that cuz it’s a low blow and I’ll almost certainly be ok where I am). This is probably selfish but I’d honestly just love to kill time and distract myself from anxiety by talking to him on the phone over text or call.He says we’re on opposite sides of the country and there’s nothing he can do, and that this is the ‘last time’ he can really go camping because he’s leaving there in 3 weeks. He asked “don’t you want me to have fun?”. He’s going to a show less than a two hour drive away with friends and is the only one camping there that night. Everyone else is coming back. I respect that he might want to have a solo camping night, but would prefer if he chose any other possible day.I would love to know if I’m being over sensitive about this. I might be overdoing my anxiety with the storm and being cooped up inside, and on a macro scale he is right that there’s little he can do. Are my expectations of him too high? Is it codependent to want your partner accessible for an event like this? Effectively, am I the asshole for desiring this of him?TL;DR:Big, long, hurricane/storm tomorrow in my town and long distance partner is going camping without service. AITA for wanting him to stay in reception to talk at times during the storm and disappointment he’s going camping?Thanks everyone!",

After thinking for a little bit, I thought about mini golf. That's something we hadn't done in a long time and it sounded fun to be outside and just hang out for a while. I decided to call her and see if she'd want to go mini golfing that day any time between then and when it closed which we had about 5 hours before it closed. When I called her she told me she would have to ask her wife, my stepmom, then would call back. I also invited my stepmother along because I had my partner along too. She then called back and said they had too much going on and I asked her what she had going on that couldn't wait a while and all she could come up with was that they had to get groceries. I don't know if this is normal for mom's to push off doing something with their kids on mothers day but it didn't feel very nice to me. After a little time me and my partner decided to just go by ourselves and then found out the moms golfed free that day. I told her that all I wanted to was do something fun with her, my mom, on mothers day. I told her that her not trying to find time hurt my feelings and I feel she should have tried at least but she didn't.",

	"title" : "AITA for smoking weed in my garden?",
	"body" : "It's a very long story, but the short of it is my neighbour's complaints of my smoking cannabis is leading me to be evicted.I privately rent a terraced house in the UK. My neighbours I believe own their home. I have a garden, quite enclosed and private. I smoke cannabis outside (in my garden). It's not heavy use (I mix with tobacco). I always smoke outside, never inside.I use it for anxiety. I have a lot of mental health diagnoses unfortunately, and have tried loads of anxiety meds over the years. Diazepam/lorazepam help but of course they can be addictive and it's hard to get them prescribed. I have a consultation with a medical marijuana clinic coming up.Various complaints from the neighbours about the smell of cannabis. From an initial firm (but not rude) note, through to complaining multiple times a day to the estate agents and even calling the police (who tried to force their way in to my home at 2am with paramedics because my neighbour reported I told them I'd harm myself over this, which was not true).I have tried to approach this in a friendly and reasonable way but unfortunately they will not speak to me at all. The only time one neighbour has spoken to me, it's been shouting abuse out the window.. I have no complaints from the neighbour the other side. She even told the police she hasn't noticed any cannabis smell.So... AITA for smoking in my garden? Are they the asshole for getting me evicted for this?EDIT to respond to some common comments:genuinely surprised by the amount of comments saying smoking outside is the rude/dumb thing to do. I must actually be dumb.. Because I didn't for one moment even contemplate that smoking inside would be more considerate. Outside of my own personal preference and being concerned about smoking inside the property (rental contract wise), I just imagined the smell could linger in to a neighbouring property more by being enclosed than in the outside air. So I have definitely learned something I didn't know there which may have affected things!I did respond to them, I did not ignore them. I responded with a polite note, an apology, an explanation and an offer of getting together to chat in person, plus my phone number if that wasn't possible.I did make changes. I started being more cautious where I would smoke, ensuring it's kept to the area in my garden which is most sheltered from their side and putting up some shelter (gazebo type covering with decorative fabric hangings I was hoping would absorb some smell). I always check the windows when I go out to make sure they're closed before smoking, if they're open I wait. I will go out for a walk when it's possible.edibles are not possible due to a medical condition. I was (maybe falsely?) under the impression a vape wouldn't make much difference so hadn't purchased one yet despite doing the research.it's a couple of spliffs a day, maximum. I want to take the edge off my anxiety. (which is severe and I have been seeking medical help including therapy for years, my psych and nurse know of my use and are not concerned), I don't just be high my whole life.It definitely seems I've made some clearly wrong assumptions in my handling of this in some ways, thinking I was doing the right thing when actually I may have been making it worse. So this has been helpful for that if nothing else, thank you!",

	"title" : "AITA for Not Calling My Mother After She Shared My Plans? Need Judgment on My Reaction.",
	"body" : "I (20F) embarked on a journey to Europe with dreams of a better future and a thriving career in fashion. Little did I know, this adventure would turn into a rollercoaster of challenges and emotional turmoil that would leave me questioning my relationships and my own actions. So, AITA for feeling abandoned by my mother and not reaching out to her after she shared my confidential plans with her?My arrival in Europe marked the beginning of a series of trials that I could hardly have anticipated. Living with my cousin's family initially was far from the warm embrace I expected. His wife's complaints made me feel like a burden, and their hospitality felt anything but genuine. After a month of relentless searching, I secured a spot in a shared house with 25 people. The conditions were grim, with dirty bathrooms and chaos ruling that place. I even found myself accused of theft simply because my roommate assumed I had used her hair products just cause I have curly hair.Amidst the turmoil, I managed to secure employment as a hotel housekeeper and establish a semblance of normalcy. But the feeling of homesickness soon consumed me, and I spent three months back in my home country, hoping for a warm reunion. Instead, I faced the harsh reality that life had moved on without me. My friends seemed distant, their routines uninterrupted, leaving me with a profound sense of isolation.Undeterred, I returned to Europe, determined to reignite my fading dreams. I confided in my mother about an unconventional plan to extend my stay with her, believing she would understand my aspirations and challenges. However, she crossed a line by sharing my confidential plans with the vice principal of my school without my consent. This betrayal cut deep, leaving me questioning her actions and motives.In response, I chose to distance myself from her, a decision that weighs heavily on my heart. I sought solace in conversations with my sister, hoping for some understanding and validation. To my surprise, my mother's perspective shocked me. She failed to acknowledge her misstep and rather dismissively believed I was overreacting. While I recognize that her intentions might not have been malicious, her lack of empathy feels like a sharp knife through my already wounded emotions.Now, I haven't called my mother in a week, hoping to convey my hurt and disappointment to her. On the other hand, her assertion that I would need her before she would need me sounds selfish, complicating my emotions further. I'm feeling like my vulnerability has been taken advantage of.I need judgment on whether I'm the asshole for withholding contact from my mother, despite the fact that she disregarded my trust in her and shared my private plans without my consent. I feel conflicted because, while her actions hurt me deeply, I question whether my response of not calling her might be too harsh. Could my emotional reaction be justified, or am I overreacting to a difficult situation?",

	"body" : "Hey everyone. Huge family fight just took place because I sounded my opinion on not wanting to partake in this inconvenient selfish destination wedding.We’re from the NE USA. The wedding is in Italy. About a 14 hour flight one way. I have absolutely 0 interest in partaking in this wedding. I’m sorry, I love my sister, but this is a huge ask. I just started a business, and have been working 60-70 hour weeks. To take an entire week off is just not in the cards at this time. The wedding is in June.My mother asked me “when are you placing your order for plane tickets for the wedding?” To which I replied “I’m not placing tickets because I’m not going.”Now, I live with my parents because, as a 23 year old with past alcohol addiction, I figured nothing could keep me as honest as living with my parents again. (18-22 lived on my own and supported myself.)It’s helped tremendously stay away from drinking. Quite honestly, I don’t have the financial means to move out because of the medical expenses that incurred due to rehab. And they know this, so they threw out the offer of covering all expenses. I still declined.The threat came… “either you come to the wedding or im no longer supporting you.” Keep in mind — they offered to pay for my flights and everything else. I truly have no interest in going to a wedding 1… but 2, one thousands of miles away. I’m happy where i am, I have no desire to visit any other countries (I know, uncultured… just doesn’t interest me)It gets more complicated. I had a really bad breakup that led to my drinking issue in the first place. I know it’s selfish on my part, but I have a really hard time witnessing true intimacy. And to ask me to travel for an entire week to watch that? I don’t know that would be conducive to my mental state.I have 0 interest in this wedding, and if it was stateside, or even perhaps within a 3 hour plane ride I’d be more inclined to attend.I’m not trying to justify looking like the asshole, I just need to know if I am being one.Tl;dr: don’t want to attend sisters destination wedding, I think she’s being selfish, but because I have no interest in attending, my mom thinks I’m TA.",

I was unsuccesful, basically too busy with other things.So I found a company who wanted to try Airbnb there, and basically gave it to them for £2100 a month. The contract also stipulates all ongoing maintanence to be their responsiblity.The house next to it, which we also own is rented at £950 a month.I plan to leave the country in a year, and I am not interested in managing anything. We have an estate agent, but I don't want the liability of ongoing maintanence.So I decided, I wanted to lease that house as well to the a company for a similar price. The tenant was on a rolling lease, not a fixed contract so I dont have to give a long notice period but I didnt want to be suddenly put this on them, so I gave them a roughly 4 month warning period. In addition, I gave them the last 2 months rent free.Theyd put in new flooring in the house. the agent gave them permission without asking me, and the tenants had over paid. I wish theyd have asked me I could have gotten a better deal for them. Obviously I needed to pay for the flooring as theyd just put it in and it adds to the value of my house so I accepted whatever they had paid and I will reimburse them for it.I told this to my sibling and I was accused of profiteering. While I accept it isnt ethical to kick someone out to make more money, I am also running a business here. And I did try to make this as fair as I can, giving plenty of time and notice. I also plan to give the deposit back in full no matter the state of the house as I want to do a full refurb anyways, it wont matter to me if a few small things are broken.",

I consider myself to be well liked especially by the people I assist and the other assistants. My personality is very goofy, but also edgy and offensive. When i say something overly offensive, I make sure im saying it to the people with whom I very close with. i tend to be flirty, but only because all the attractive older women at work flirt with me first. I really do get along with almost everyone and I think that people enjoy the happy vibes I bring to work. I worry that I May be the asshole because I give of douchey cocky vibes. Like I can say whatever I want and get away with it.Anyway, a couple months ago I gave my friend, with whom Im very close with and hang out with outside of work, a pat on the head. She says, something like, \"omg you basically see me as a pet dog\" or something like that. I replied, \"yup your basically a golden retriever.\" I proceeded to get ripped a new one by one of the older male hairstylist. He basically yelled at me saying im gonna get sued for sexual harrassment, and that calling someone a dog is implying something sexual, which made the situation super awkward because their was nothing sexual about it. Every client that was trying to enjoy their shampoo and scalp massage could hear him. My friend laughed that I got yelled at. She thought it was funny.Fast forward to today, I have somewhat repaired my relationship with the older male hairstylist, I dont hold grudges. I was talking with the same friend and she was talking why she doens't go to mexico to visit her grandfather. She mentioned it was too dangerous so I asked, \"where does he live in Mexico? Like what city?\" She said. \"He lives in a state.\" I said \"What do you mean? they have cities in Mexico. We are laughing and having a dumb conversation about the classifications of land in Mexico, when the same older male white hairstylists says \"what village does he live in?\". I replied to him in a sillly high pitched joking voice, \"Thats Racist!\" the implied point being that not everyone in mexico lives in a poor tiny village. I was obviously Joking. He then ripped me a new one, shouting that there are villages all over the world including the U.S. so its not racist. He then said very loudly \"Fuck you!, Seriously fuck you!\" . All the clients relaxing were interupted. I said, \"I wasnt actually calling you racist.\" He replied, \"It doenst matter you still said it.\" I personally feel he went way over the top and was incredibly unprofessional, especially at a salon of this caliber with clients paying the type of money they are. I also dont really know what set him off so I dont really know how to tiptoe around him. I feel like hes mad because I can joke and be myself and never get in trouble. But maybe im the asshole, and I need to be more professional at work. But i really think by the laughs and responses I get that im not being a douchbag. AITA?",

I am not proud to admit it, but I had another child while I was married to Rachel through another relationship.

She passed away recently, and Aiden was alone.I did not want my son to suffer like that, without any parents. The reason I did not reveal his identity to Rachel and Lia is that I did not want to cause a fight, but now I had no choice. I went through all the proper procedures to get custody of Aiden. I made him live in my house.My wife and Lia did not take it well. They went absolutely ballistic when they learned about him, and Rachel screamed about how I shouldn't even dare to think of letting him take even a step inside. Lia was saying the same stuff. But I did not back down, and they eventually had to be fine with the decision.They have been absolutely livid about it, and Rachel has been demanding to get Aiden away from the house. I told her that I am not going to do that, and warned her against doing anything to him. Lia got mad and asked me whether I value \"someone who was born out of a whore\", and I lost my temper. I got up and asked them to \"get the fuck out of my house\" if they do not want to reside with Aiden. In the end Rachel was crying and they're not talking to me now.AITA?",

Unfortunately, I recently quit my job and cannot afford to rent my current flat. Katia lives in a nice neighbourhood and owns her flat. It’s a two bedroom flat except she converted one bedroom into her office space. Except that she doesn’t need it. Katia is a writer. She writes romance novels and self publishes them. She’s one of the lucky ones who actually make quite a lot of money doing that. The thing is, she doesn’t need an office. She can write from anywhere, her living room, her bedroom, she sometimes writes in a library, coffee shop, the castle ruins (of the weather is nice), the beach. You get the point.As I’m not unemployed, I’ve thought about finally chasing my dream and starting streaming games. For that, I need a separate room to put my set up and record things. When I first talked to Katia about moving in, she was apprehensive but the more we talked, the more open she was to the idea. Last night, I mentioned that she’d have to get rid off her office. She asked why and I told her that she can write wherever she wants and I need a space to start my streaming career. She replied that it was not going to happen, we can make some space in the living room but she needs her office.I told her it’s just silly books, she can write them anywhere and I can’t bring my gaming set up to a cafe.She told me to not diminish her work and I said I wasn’t but it’s true, her job isn’t hat difficult and she can do it from the couch.She got really weird after. Tris morning when I was about to leave her house, she told me I had to look for my own flat because she didn’t want to move in together.I asked her if she was serious? And she said that yes, I was disrespectful and demanding she got rid off her office was asshole behaviour. I told her I only wanted us to work together and it’s asshole behaviour to leave me without a place to stay when she knows I can’t afford my flat.She told me she had  to think about this and called me but I told her when she calls me I expect an apology.I was venting to my mate over a lunch beer today and he agreed with me but his girlfriend said Katia was right and I was the asshole.

Yesterday evening, after he had left, my roommate approached me and told me she didn’t want him to come over anymore. When I asked her why she just said that she didn’t like him. That kind of surprised me because up until then they’ve always gotten along.I asked if anything happened or if she had a reason why she suddenly didn’t like him but she said no.

I trust them completely obviously since they are old and wise enough to stay home alone, I thought...While I was away, my youngest son apparently wanted to eat some fresh peaches, my husband had just bought. When he opened one of them, there were some \"white spots\" around the seed. My son was concerned about that and asked his older sister for advice. She agreed that it looked bad and thus he threw the peach away.Now if they had done that to 1 peach, that would be fine, but they kept opening peaches and throwing them away because of the \"white spots\".  They ended up leaving 2 peaches of the whole bunch.When I came home that night and opened the trash can, I saw all those cut peaches laying there and I couldn't be more furious. The \"white spots\" are just normal spots when the peach isn't ripe yet.I was livid, but my kids were already asleep so I decided to confront her the next morning when we were having breakfast. I told her my heart broke when I saw those peaches and that I expect her to take responsibility and pay them back. She got all defensive and argued \"she wouldn't pay it, because she already pays the gas for the car, our Netflix etc\".I pointed out that by being so defensive, she was not taking responsibility for her actions. I left it at that and I didn't actually expect her to pay anything back. I just said it so she would think twice in the future before throwing perfectly fine food out.Now today is a holiday so all the stores were closed (except for a few out of town). I noticed however my daughter getting ready to go to the store \"because she needed something\". She came back with a new bag of peaches.I was surprised that she was still going on about that little discussion: I just made a comment about it, I didn't expect her to ACTUALLY refund the peaches. I said she needed to be more resistent against criticism and shouldn't get pissed at every comment I make because that's not very adultish.She got mad (again LOL) and said that I am an asshole for not being appreciative of her getting the peaches.So Reddit: AITA?EDIT: I really need to clarify some things  hereI do not hate or despise my daughter, I love her very much and she loves me too.

So I had an idea to put a note on the fridge and put some post it notes on the kitchen counter saying ‘you have by this date to claim your freezer drawers. (It would be two weeks from putting the note up). If it isn’t done by that time any unopened food will be donated to a food bank and if it IS opened turned into communal food for the flat.’Would I be the Asshole if I did this?

	"title" : "AITA: I (29f) think my husband (32m) is going to divorce me over juul",
	"body" : "I have been juling since my second year of college and vaping in general since I was 16. Juul has been my daily habit and I used to contain it to just during work or on the drive into work and home. When my husband and I dated, I was juling heavily at the time (start of COVID). He had quit smoking when we started dating. As time went on, he started juling with me even though I discouraged it. It has been a pain point in our relationship - I've tried to quit 3 times before during our relationship to no avail.Quitting juul and nicotine made me depressed beyond my wildest dreams. He always pressures me into quitting and recently for our honeymoon, we were going to a country where ecigs were illegal. For two weeks I didn't smoke and I was on edge. He quit during that time too.When we got back (2 weeks ago) | found my old juul with some juice in it, I took it in the car and smoked it on my way in and back home but never brought it home and cut down on my smoking tremendously. I've bought a pack of juul which I'm not finished with yet last week.Two nights ago, I discussed with my therapist how guilty I felt about lying to my husband but he's told me repeatedly that if I start up again he'll divorce me. I want to quit and I am, but it's a process to undo a habit of over 10+ years. I even took new medication to help with nicotine withdrawal and it's been helping. I went from smoking four juuls a day to barely one juul every 2 days.Today, he found my juul in the car and stormed out - I know I shouldn't have lied to him but I felt like I had no choice. He doesn't understand why I can't quit cold turkey like he can/did. It's not even about the nicotine anymore - it's about the habit of having something and puffing on it.I feel so alone - he's gone and probably won't be back until late and think it's the end of our marriage.I never felt like I could be honest about it - he’s said multiple times that if I start again he’ll divorce me and even said it as he was walking out.Am I the asshole for lying to him about fully quitting when we got back from our honeymoon?Post edit: We had tried to quit three other times and he had successfully quit each time: he had quit cold turkey those times only to start again when I brought back into the house and restarted. He pushed for those times, but this time he said I will quit when you decide to and I decided to quit before the honeymoon. He has self control problems but the way he controls it is not have access, he is angry because he went through hell like withdrawals with me for quitting just for me to secretly start again. He has also quit things very important to him for our relationship (his life long hobby of motorcycling) and says I should do the same.",

	"body" : "I (36f) am thinking of adopting a pet (a dog or a cat) even though my husband (42M) doesn’t want one. I’ve been thinking about this for awhile, like the last 15 years.Context: en I was growing up my family had a cat, and then when I was a little older we got a dog. And I loved them dearly. I’ve always wanted to adopt a dog or cat on my own, but wasn’t really ready for the responsibility during college. And then after graduating I moved out of the US for a few years so I didn’t adopt while abroad.Luckily during this time I was living with Roommates who usually did have pets and I loved it - while not mine, being around animals was always so much fun.Anyways I also met my (now) husband while I was abroad, and I was always open with him about wanting to have a pet. My husband does not share that feeling. He did not grow up with pets, and while he’s lived with pets and is not allergic. This is starting to become an issue now. We’ve been together for 11 years, married for 7 and have 2 young kids. When we  moved back to the US (like 9 years ago) we had a really small apartment in a big city. We got engaged (around the same time) and he said he’d be okay getting a pet once we had a bigger place. Well after a few years we got a bigger place with a yard and a fence. So I started talking about getting a pet. He said he’d prefer a dog to a cat, but that getting one would be irresponsible as we were both working full time in the office and wouldn’t be spend enough time with the dog who’d be home all day alone. Fair. I waited. Then we both started to have more flexible schedules and I got a remote job that let me work from home. I ask again about getting a dog, and he said ‘okay, you can get a dog, but just know if you do my quality of life will be extremely negatively impacted if you do.’So at the time I was like - a little dramatic maybe, but I’m not going to do something that would cause you so much harm. But kind of always felt like the ball was in my court. That was about 5 years ago.Since then we’ve had our two kids (4&1) and we moved out of the city to a really outdoorsy place with loads of trails. I’ve taken a new higher paying WFH role that way less of a demand on my schedule with a bump in pay and I’m thinking of adopting a pet again. I brought it up with my husband recently and he immediately said absolutely not. No discussion. Just pure annoyance at the thought.But he now travels a lot for work while I’m with the kids (when they’re not at daycare) by myself a lot of the week. I’m at a place where I can take pretty much all the responsibility on.Plus I feel like we had come to an agreement when we we got engaged about getting a pet but the goalposts kept changing and now we’re here.I guess I’m finding I care less about how his quality of life will be impacted and more about my own wants. And that’s what it is - a want, I don’t need a pet but I’ve waited a long time and feel like I’m done waiting.",

I sometimes wonder if moving in together so early on was a mistake… but that’s besides the point.For context, my family lives in a different country and his family is from the same country but different region. We live in an extremely small apartment (30m2) with two cats. Needless to say, it’s mostly their apartment and not our, seen as it’s full of cat toys and litter boxes. As for the “kitchen”, I bought a 140€ IKEA “kitchenette” just to have a sink to wash the plates in and some counter top space. We don’t have an oven and cook on hot plates.Both my parents came to our city a couple months ago and I let them come up because they’d only met one of my two cats. I know my parents are aware and aren’t judgy of my situation, so I didn’t hesitate to let them come over.A week ago, my mom and grandma came to bring me some documents I needed for university. Knowing my grandma’s standards, I knew that if I let her in my apartment I’d never hear the end of it. Plus, my boyfriend wasn’t cooperating with the cleaning. So I just avoided the entire situation and met up with them at their Airbnb (owned by a family friend).Bf’s mom and grandma want to come visit and bring some food over. They’re staying for 4 days, sleeping at his uncle’s house (who lives in our same city). He’s what one might call both a mamma’s boy and a grandma’s boy (he’s Italian). Everything they say or do is right in his eyes. His grandma and I have had a few arguments in the past because she obviously only thinks about her grandson’s wellbeing and not my boundaries. Well, when I got home today from class I caught him deep cleaning the house because he wants his grandma to see our apartment.We got into a huge fight because I don’t want anyone coming over that I know will judge the size, cleanliness (cats don’t help)  and overall furnishing of my house. I told him no one is coming over and accused him of not lifting a finger when my grandma was here and cleaning every inch of the house when his is coming.Am I exaggerating? Is it just the twisted “rivalry” she feels against me that’s making me develop feelings of disgust and rejection? AITA for not letting them come over?",

We bonded over several of our favorite authors and libraries were our hangouts. Anna became less and less into books when she started dating her current boyfriend. They’ve been together for 2 years and I’m happy for them but I’m also wary of him sometimes.Anna is a gamer now because of her bf. He introduced her to Overwatch and she got addicted for weeks, then they tried playing other games like Fortnite, Valorant, Nintendo games, you know all those. Which is fine but then Anna started getting into the frankly misogynistic “gamer girl” aesthetic.She sent me pictures of her gaming PC that she entirely built herself and just spent money on expensive figures and decorations for it. It’s also all pink. She bought pink mice and now has a collection of pink keyboards. She also changed her avatars on Discord to anime or video game avatars. She seems really into the aesthetic of girls who are pressured into a super feminine role as a gamer.I started wondering if her bf is pressuring her into that role, so I reached out and let her know that it’s okay to still love books and you don’t have to be those gamer girls who are just obsessed with pink. She said that she just has new hobbies right now but she still loves books and she doesn’t mind hanging out with me. I told her I’m sad she doesn’t hang out anymore because it feels like her bf is just forcing her to play games.She got really defensive and said her bf has helped her get really good at games and build her gaming aesthetic. Tho tbh I don’t get those gaming aesthetics where you spend $1000 on decorations, posters, and a parts inside of a PC that you’re never going to even use. I said that it feels like she’s contributing to a misogynistic image of female gamers and it feels pick-meish.She responded by calling me a judgemental asshole and that she can invest in any hobby she wants. Am I really the asshole? She was never super into pink or interacting with guy gamers online in Discord 24/7 so it comes off as pick-me to me.",

	"body" : "These events occurred over the summer, during which I was a part of a summer program at my university. There were 20 students total, so a fairly close knit group.One of the facets of the program was translating Ancient Greek. Some members of the program enjoyed it, but others saw it as a necessary hoop to jump through to indulge their interest in discussion based philosophy and theology classes, which was the other facet of the program. Thus, a lot of my friends decided to make the former easier on themselves and copied off of others for Greek homework.I personally didn’t do this, but my friends did, and I don’t think this hurt anybody. The class itself isn’t graded on a curve, so one doing well by cheating doesn’t lessen somebody else’s grade. However, one member of the 20 found it ‘immoral’ and so turned these students in to the professor, leading to their grades taking a dive.I found this, for lack of a better term, a dick move. They weren’t hurting anybody, and yet he decided to be a snitch regardless. I began to wonder if he would do something similar with other examples of ‘rule breaking’— underage drinking, drug use, etc— that he was privy to, since he demonstrated a belief in the rules for their own sake regardless of if breaking them hurt somebody.Thus I decided it was safer to just stop inviting him to anything were any rule breaking. This resulted in him no longer being invited to essentially any social event, and he was essentially a pariah.After the summer was over, I still mostly avoid him. Today, he confronted me and said I was an AH for ostracizing him from my friend group for following his morals. I think that’s stupid, because what did he expect? That my friends would think it was a good idea to hang out with him after he turned them in for plagiarism and hurt their grades?AITA?",

It's an ongoing joke between all of us that Mary and Richard like to flirt playfully(NOTE: they did this even when she too was in a relationship, and prior to his own). Aside from that everyone's friendship is Normal. Paul also has said that he only view Mary as a friend and even a \"sister\" at some point. Richard has now been in a relationship and it is important to point out that he doesn't talk to Mary unless Paul is around.So now leading to the party everyone was very excited, especially since a few of us flew out to see Paul. As the party starts, Richard, Paul, Mary, and I are the first people there considering we are the closest to Paul. After we all have a few drinks it's going fine and no one is doing anything out of the ordinary. Mary asks for a few things and Richard goes to go grab them for her. When he got back I jokingly said \"Shes not going to F*** you bro\". Richard scoffed and we all kept having a good time preparing the grilled food as more people trickled in. Later on in the party Mary again asked Richard for some water and he went to go grab it for her, He also brought another case of drinks for people. As he got back I again said \"Dude like I said she's not going to f*** you\", once again no one found it funny so I said. \"My bad that joke didn't stick did it\". Richard then leaves to go talk to some other people and doesn't talk to me that much after.Later in the party after many drinks we began doing karaoke and I sat next to Mary. I saw her looking at Paul and Richard in a promiscuous way. I leaned over to tell her something along the lines of \"Stop looking at Richard like that he has a girlfriend, and Paul is only your friend they don't want to hook up\". I said this hoping that she would stop and not try anything as I feel like it would hurt the friend group dynamic. Shortly after Paul came over and walked her to another conversation away from me.After even more drinks I was joking around with Richard and told him Mary kept looking at him in an interesting way, I told him if he isn't happy in his relationship he should go for Mary. I was testing his loyalty in his current relationship to see how he would react. Once again he brushed me off and walked away. (Note: Richard and his girlfriend got into an argument right before the weekend started)A week after the party Paul and Richard told me how weird I was being the whole night. They claimed I was making Mary uncomfortable when everyone was just trying to have a good time.Am I the asshole for testing my friend's loyalty and wanting to keep the friend group whole?",

My wife doesn't like to go, so she stayed home with our kids (ages 5 and 7).Well, I'm 35 now, and I don't drink nearly as much as I used to in my college days, but Dave and another friend had an idea to play a drinking game with shots of Fireball, an old college liquor. I agreed, and we were getting drunker and drunker until I finally was starting to not remember certain pieces of the evening. Well, at the end of the game, I remember Dave's wife calling me an Uber home. She forbade any of us from driving in our condition.I got home and it was a struggle to even stand up.

It's a metal shoe rack on a tile floor, so when I went down, the metal pieces actually broke apart and slid on the tile. It made a tremendous noise. Everyone in the house woke up.

They came downstairs and I smiled at them, but they started to cry and seemed really concerned about me. I told them that I was just a little sick and that they should go back to bed, but then my wife appeared.She seemed pretty mad at me. When she finally got me up the stairs, she gave me an earful. She said that I had no right to get as drunk as I got and that I owed our kids a truthful explanation of what happened and an apology. I told her that she was being way too rough on me and reminded her that it could be worse. I could have driven myself home, but she seemed to give me no credit at all for that. At this point, I was feeling sick to my stomach, and I vomited several times in the toilet. She blamed me for keeping her awake listening to me throwing up, but I reminded her that I left the door closed and that she has a whit noise machine on her nightstand. Long story short, she's still really mad at me and I don't know what she wants me to tell the kids. It's as if she has no tolerance for even the slightest of mistakes.

	"body" : "EDIT: for some reason some of the text got deleted when I posted this so I am adding back the missing info.This happened a few days ago now but people are still mad at me so I wanted to get some more opinions.My (F31) husband (M31) has a friend since high school \"John\" (M30) who moved to a different country a few years ago, where he met his fiancee \"Maria\" (F 27??).  John messaged my husband and their friends a few months ago to let them know that he and Maria would be visiting for the holidays and thinking about moving here, so we planned to have a gift exchange with my friends and my husband's friends (including John and Maria).We did all this on Christmas day, but about a week before Christmas we attended a welcome home party for John, where I met Maria for the first time. I had a neutral feeling towards her. I don't dislike her, I just think we are very different people and have nothing to talk about or bond over. She did seem to think she was better than everyone though (at one point someone made a comment about her engagement ring and John said that it didn't contain diamonds/stones that were mined because Maria wanted something that was more sustainable and better for the environment??? which seemed a bit braggy).The day of the gift exchange we all opened the secret Santa gifts first, and then we opened our gifts from our partners. When it was Maria's turn, she opened John's gift which was a few books wrapped in some newspaper and string, and a journal. I didn't really think much of it at first but then as she was looking all of the books I noticed that a lot of them had bent spines and covers, and looked to be old/used which was a bit off-putting since I know John makes good money.When one of my friends took her turn after Maria, I joked: \"I hope your gift isn't also  someone else's sloppy-second hand-me-downs!\" My joke kinda bombed and everyone went quiet and looked at me and Maria. Maria kinda tried to hide the books, but John spoke up and said that he only bought used books because Maria only buys used books and again brought up how it's supposedly better for the environment and more \"sustainable\". At this point, I kinda doubled down because I was embarrassed that everyone was looking at me like I had just murdered a puppy, but the mood quickly soured and John and Maria left shortly after that without even waiting for the rest of us to open our gifts.Now everyone is upset with me and saying that I was being rude and unwelcoming and that Maria is really nice and didn't deserve that. My husband wants me to apologize but I'm not sure if I should since I obviously didn't and couldn't have known that Maria wanted used items and it was supposed to be a funny joke.EDIT: Okay, I get it. I am going to apologize to John.",

	"body" : "When I was in college I studied abroad in Florence, Italy for 6 weeks. This was always a dream of mine and was the first time I left the US. I was already taking out loans for school and thought I could take out a loan for this and at first the school thought so too but last minute they said I took out everything I could.So I took out a college bank loan and asked many people if they could co-sign it. My mom, grandma and others tried but were rejected. My aunt from my dad’s side (don’t talk to my dad bc he’s an AH) said she would.Flash forward to 8 years later and I am still paying the loan. It started off as $7,000 and I have about $2,000 left. I also have my other college loans that I pay, which she knows. When I got a $1000 bonus from work for Christmas, I used it all for my loan.My aunt is mad it is not paid off by now and is complaining about me to my family and even asked them to talk to my mom to talk to me. She is saying she wants to retire and can’t if there is still a loan out there. I don’t think this is true but that’s what she says. The issue is that she’s making it seem like she personally lent me the money and I am not paying her. I know this because my cousin asked me about it and was surprised when I said it was a bank loan and not money my aunt gave me. My aunt has told other family members who ask to borrow money from her that she is unsure because I haven’t paid her back. Again it’s a loan she co-signed, she didn’t lend me her money.My school I worked at just closed and I got a bonus and paid out for my vacation days and I’m using it to travel in South America for 6 weeks and then come back to see if my company has any other jobs. She does not know about this. But am I the AH for not paying off the loan instead of traveling? I pay my loan every month and was late a few times throughout the years  but never late enough where they charged me a late fee or she had to pay.I worked really hard and just wanted to travel for a bit and saw this as an opportunity.",

I want to ask her to pay the total amount for what the remote actually cost, but I’m afraid she might not think that’s fair (and honestly, I have my doubts as well).This is similar to a discussion we had a time ago, where she caused the window of my car to be broken. I submitted a claim to my insurance company, and they replaced it, and I just paid my deductible (a small fraction of what it would have cost). However, I told her that I believed she had to reimburse the total amount for the window replacement because the insurance (or warranty in the case of the Apple TV) was something I paid myself.If the broken window or the remote costs less or is free, it is because of the charges I assumed when getting the insurance or warranty.Edit: thanks all for your comments and opinions, some of you offered great advises.

There’s constant jumping, stomping, and running. While I 100% don’t blame the kid for just being a kid, I’m pissed off that his mom knowingly chose to live on the highest floor above people. I just feel like there HAD to have been a floor unit available she could have chose. The complex is long and not tall. There’s only 3 floors total with more of a vertical stretching design so I think it was definitely do-able. It’s multiple 3 floor buildings chained together so it’s not a tower environment. My fiancée is a lot more forgiving and she always says that he’s just a kid she can’t control him. To a certain extent I don’t disagree but I just feel like it’s a courtesy thing to:Keep your kid from running around after 9pm and before 10am OrOr just be conscious of others and choose a ground unitOne time they woke me up with huge thumping and thuds, maybe jumping too? Not sure. But it was 5AM so I was really upset. I usually restrain myself from doing this any other time, but I grabbed a broom and banged on the ceiling. Throughout the day if it gets too excessive I’ll blast my anime or music from my tv or speakers at max volume to drown the kid out. I don’t do it the moment I hear something because I understand to a certain extent, but when it gets overly excessive that’s when I’ll do it. Am I in the wrong here? I just think the mom lacked empathy when she chose to live on the 3rd floor with a rambunctious child. I want to workout at home more instead of paying for a gym but I’m waiting until I move into a house soon so I’m not jumping and slamming over someone’s head. And even if she’s been there for years before she had the kid, she could have renewed her lease in a ground unit instead. I’ve been here for the past year and a half so I don’t know how long she’s been here. From august of 2022 to august of 2023 it wasn’t that bad. But she’s been in her apartment more with the child ever since September.TL;DR: Loud toddler upstairs throughout all times of the day, not mad at the kid but I’m irritated with the mom who chose to live/continues to live above people knowing how much noise it’s causing.

My fiancée is currently out of a job and has been for nearly a year. But, he’s a sweetheart and has been a great plant dad for me for the past few weeks as Ive picked up more shifts.

The youngest is with my husband, 40m, the oldest is with my ex from when I was 18 and my daughter is with Lance, a man I should never have been with but an so glad I was because I have her. He was abusive and narcissistic. My husband views her as his, and she's his princess. She's met Lance once and didn't like him. I moved out of state last year, and my son stayed behind.Today was supposed to be a great day. We had extra chores to do before going to see the Mario movie since both the younger two were supposed to go with friends weeks ago, and that didn't pan out. We were halfway through our work when I decided it was lunchtime. My husband wanted to go out. My younger two spent the car ride arguing over the gift they convinced their brother to get me for Mother's Day, and I told them no to calling him, which resulted in pouting. I didn't want them to call him because I know he works Saturdays, and I figured I could text him later. So they moved on to competing for whose phone could make the most noise with YouTube, TikTok qetc. By the time we got to the restaurant, I was at my wit's end. Then my son texted and mentioned that somebody t-boned his car in the parking lot overnight so he wasn't going to work. My kids asked if they could call him since he wasn't at work. I said no since he's dealing with his vehicle. He didn't need the stress of his siblings vying for his attention. More pouting. Whatever. Then my youngest started singing a song from the movie and my daughter told him to save it for the movie and he told her he likes the song and he kept singing. In fairness, I missed this exchange because I was texting my oldest. What I did catch was my youngest screaming at his sister, not to mess with his food. So my head snapped up, and I whisper yelled \"stop, or the day is over.\" I asked what the scream was for. She'd put gravy on his fries. I asked her why. She said she was playing. I asked how it's playing to mess with his food? She didn't answer. I asked if she thought it was funny. No answer. I told her that's something Lance would always do, mess with people to upset them on purpose, and call it a game. My husband had already looked irritated when I started in on her and cut me off when I said that. We paid and left, and in the car, I accused him of being mad that I reprimanded his princess. He asked why I always claim that, and I said he always defends her no matter what. He said I need to stop comparing her to Lance, but this is the first time I've ever said something like that, although it's not the first time I thought it. He then told me that our son started it with the Princess Peach song again. I replied that my son needed to stop too but that the being annoying and messing with food are not the same.So, AITA for saying what I thought of my daughter's actions?ETA: I love my daughter. Nobody who knows me in person thinks I'm abusive. Actually, most who know me in personi aspire to be a mom like me in most ways, though I'm not perfect as evidenced here. I don't ever start off by yelling at her except to get her attention. I talk to her because I want answers. This was a discussion I was trying to have with her, not a screaming fest. I was calmly asking her why because I wanted to know what she was thinking. It's easier to address the behavior if you know the reason behind the behavior. I use the same discussion method on all my kids. When my oldest was a teen, he wouldn't respond, but he also wouldn't give me a dead stare. He'd look down like he was uncomfortable, but his ear would be tilted toward me. He'd slightly shake his head if I asked if he thought his behavior was OK. He'd give me some response to know he was listening. My youngest actually responds to everything. But I think my oldest's response is more typical. Even though she doesn't respond at all to me or anybody else, whether the behavior is addressed in the moment or after the fact, it still has to be addressed.You can say I was TA in this moment, which I accept, but don't act like you know our entire lives. I love my daughter, I've been accused of favoritism toward her and I've been accused of favoritism towards my others and I try to be conscious of both but really, I think they're different kids and in different situations need different types of attention. Everybody seems to think I ignored my son's behavior. I didn't mention it originally because the post was about the interaction with my daughter, but I did address his annoyance once I realized it. I told him that he needed to find something else to focus on that wouldn't annoy his sister or he would miss the movie and stay home with his cousins who had opted not to go. This was 3 hrs before the movie. We did all see the movie, and my daughter got extra candy for being the most helpful and cooperative and even doing some of her brother's room, so I'm guess she's my favorite, right?",

	"title" : "AITA for asking my boyfriend to finish his fast early so we can eat together?",
	"body" : "My boyfriend (m22) and I (f22) have been dating for around 10 months now. He’s Muslim, while I’m atheist. He prays and everything and while I can privately admit I find the ritual a tiny bit silly, I’d never tell him that or ask him not to.He’s fasting, and it’s honestly frustrating enough to me that we’re supposed to go a full month without getting lunch or dinner, or kissing, or being intimate. I’m throwing a barbecue lunch party for work in a few days, and it’s my first social outing with this group of people, even my boss is going to be in attendance. The food will be served around 5 or 5:30, but the thing is, my BF fasts until like 8. I was worried it’ll reflect poorly on me if he doesn’t eat with the rest of us, so I asked him if he could fast for the day but kind of end it early so he could still eat with us.When I asked he said he couldn’t, because then the whole day wouldn’t count, but that he’d still be at the lunch and he just wouldn’t eat. I tried to explain again that it would make me look bad, but he shrugged and said if my boss and coworkers had an issue with his faith that was a reflection on them, not me or him. I really don’t feel like it’s a big deal for him to end a few hours early when compared with a whole month of this stuff, and it really feels to me like he’s ignoring what I want in favor of what he wants. Not only that but he’s risking my image and relationships at work over a few hours’ worth of fasting. AITA for that?Edit: Okay, I get it, I’m an asshole, or the worst person in the world, or whatever. Can you stop messaging me death threats now?",

They run wild, they act like louts, dress inappropriately for occasions and seem to have no viable plans for the future. My husband tried his best, but he did have to work awfully long hours to support them.My step-daughter, May has been suspended twice for not following the uniform rules and pointlessly arguing with the teachers, Will had always been beside her during the arguments, or would start acting badly after finding out his sister was in isolation so that he could join her. They seem to be very codependent on each other, Nowell seems to find it sweet but I think it's unhealthy and I've started putting up boundaries between them.Due to their bad behaviour being influenced by one another, they no longer can text each other at school, nor can they both go out at the same time. Will isn't allowed to use the car with May there as she'll just encourage him to be reckless.They both don't seem to care about their appearance either, though they're not slobs. Will has recently tried to grow out his hair and his beard, and he only dresses in old Adidas and Nike from charity shops seemingly. May wears clothes way too adult for her, and she always goes overboard on the make up. Therefore, I've required Will to visit a barber each month and to shave regularly if he still wants to get an allowance each month, I've also told him that he needs to buy new, more formal attire for occasions when that kind of dress will be inappropriate. May has been told she can't wear make up at school, nor can she use it too heavily whilst at home. I've made her aware that clothes that are too revealing have to be put away for when she's younger, and that I'll take her shopping for new clothes to replace themI've also required them to set themselves a goal for the future, as their only aspiration right now is to say that they are going to become models. They have to be either studying towards a career or getting an apprenticeship. This will apply to May once she does her GCSEs.Nowell agrees with all these rules, but my step kids have been saying that they are too restrictive and acting out against them. May will regularly argue with me about the dress code and the make up, and Will always backs her up.

They declined.I tried reporting the issue, but nothing came of it- I guess weed control laws aren't heavily enforced.At this point, I feel like pulling out all the dandelions myself, or at least spraying some sort of killer on their lawn to see if it helps, because I can't deal with this anymore.WIBTA?",

He paid me back and when I jokingly told him to add a ludicrous “friend tax” he added that too.However afterwards he called me (not a good sign) and asked why I didn’t just let him pay that night if I obviously couldn’t afford it. I told him that my reason didn’t matter at all but he disagreed. Then he sounded pretty depressed and asked what purpose our friendship serves for me (he listed what it serves for him)  and what exactly I like about him. I told him that I’m happy to give the money back to him if he’s starting to be so dramatic about it all.When my girlfriends found out, they quickly and unanimously agreed that it was a trashy ahole move to make him pay me back.

This is an award-winning publication, and it often features really interesting stories that I hadn't read because they were behind a paywall.  I was very pleased to have received the gift.  The thing is, I work full-time and need to start my day early, so I don't really have the time to read the paper deeply during the work week.  It's on Saturdays and Sundays that I can dedicate as much time as I want to it.Well, earlier this morning, my wife and I were sitting in our living room, and she was in the mood to talk over our morning coffee.  Normally, this is fine, though she does tend to ramble on and on about stuff I don't always care about, but today it was getting pretty annoying.  Furthermore, she seemed oblivious that my one or two-word answers to her questions meant that I was trying to read and didn't really want to talk in that moment.  Finally, during one of her interruptions, I turned to her and said \"Can't you see that I'm trying to read the paper?\"She became offended and sort of got a surprised look on her face, but that quickly turned to anger.  She tried to guilt-trip me and tell me that \"we never catch up anymore,\" but I reminded her that I am home every night after work, even though some days I work late/get caught in traffic.  At one time, I worked a job that required extensive travel, where I would be gone for weeks at a time, so I don't think she has any room to complain about my current work situation.  Nonetheless, she wanted to make this difficult by refusing to let me read.At this point, my wife is still upset with me, and I don't know what to do.  I'm considering locking myself in an empty room for a few hours because this seems to be the only way she won't disturb me, but even then I could see how she would knock on the door every 10-15 minutes.  I just need her to understand that what she's doing is making my Christmas gift essentially worthless, but she doesn't seem to have any respect for my father's money at all.

He was on the quieter side and only really hung out with the same few people in school, while I have always been more outgoing and had/have a lot of friends. I'm not trying to criticize his socializing skills or anything, just giving some background about our personalities.Anyways, over the past couple years I've been steadily growing an Instagram presence and have become a bit of an \"influencer\" if you will. I get invited to fancy parties sometimes because of this and this has started some conflict between me and my bf.I of course want my bf to come with me to these parties, but here's the problem. He's not the most fashion forward, and he'll show up to parties wearing something basic like jeans and a button-up shirt. My followers all know me for my sense of style and the influencer circles I run in are also fashion-related, so it's a bit embarrassing for both him and me when he comes to parties dressed like that. I've seen my friends and peers side-eyeing him and it's honestly just so mortifying.This all came to a head last night when one of my influencer guy friends, I'll call him Jason, made a comment about my bf's clothing at a party we were at. He wasn't super mean or anything, just noted how my bf looks out of place and teased a little bit about how he even got an invite. For comparison, Jason always dresses super nicely and always looks very sharp. I just kind of laughed and joked about how he must've just wandered in, and I admittedly did kind of avoid my bf for the rest of the night.This morning, I got a text from my bf asking me if everything was okay cuz I was kind of distant last night. I didn't even really know what to say at first, but finally just decided to tell him straight up that he needs to start dressing more appropriately for these parties or else I won't invite him to them anymore. He hasn't responded since.AITA for that comment?

So that the cats can have the option to roam or have their own isolated space, R has a pet door in her bedroom doorway with a small gate for the cats to go through. A few days ago R was going into her room and bumped my dog’s head with the gate. It wasn’t a hard bump and not hard enough to seriously injure her, but R did not react to it in any way whatsoever, not even a glance to see if my dog was ok. I calmly commented to R that she bumped my dog’s head, and her response was a very sarcastic ‘sorry.’ At that I was fuming, but I tried not to explode. I took my dog on her morning walk so I could have time to cool down. After we got back I said as calmly as I could to R that her response was not acceptable. Her response was getting up, walking over, and closing her door in my face. She has a disorder that causes periods of irritability, so I tried to chalk it up to that and figured that after it passed she would apologize. This morning R still hadn’t said anything, so I brought it up again and she snapped and yelled at me saying that I was somehow ‘projecting’ my being offended onto my dog, and she thinks she doesn’t have to apologize for the bump or how she shut her door in my face because she didn’t actually injure my dog. Now I don’t want to have anything to do with her and told her that she is not to go anywhere near my dog, I’m never leaving my dog alone with her again, and I plan to move out as soon as possible. So, the question is, am I the asshole for overreacting, or is she the asshole for being disrespectful to both me and my dog?Edit for context: I am on the Autism Spectrum and my dog is my service dog for it. R obviously knows this and is well aware that I feel very protective of her. Being on the spectrum, certain things bother me to a degree that they wouldn’t bother other people. I never let it out though, I keep it contained and do not ever snap or explode. I constantly filter my words and actions and have done so for so many years that it’s automatic and it’s incredibly stressful, which is why I have a service dog. R is well aware of all this. To be clear I also maintained a calm demeanor throughout this whole thing. I didn’t yell at her, I didn’t rant at her, I tried to express to her that there was an issue. She responded with a lack of concern in the moment when it happened, she shut her door in my face which is a bit childish to do instead of just trying to sort it out, and after it being brought up again multiple days later when the occurrence was no longer immediate, she responded by yellingEdit for character content: I am not trying to villainize R, she’s a good person.

We invited my MIL and FIL (60s) and my BIL's (30's), my family wasn't there as they live on the other side of the country. My MIL is a very standoffish and introverted person and does not care much for kids. My husband said that she only had him and brothers because FIL really wanted kids and there were different expectations for women 30 years ago. He says she never abused them and always met their needs but as soon as FIL was home and dinner was on the table she would withdraw from the kids. He says he never felt any deep connection with her and it hurts him deeply to know he doesn't have a 'real' mother.After dinner my husband stands up and makes the announcement and everyone is thrilled and MIL says congratulations but I can tell she is not as excited as everyone else. After dinner, MIL is helping him with dishes in the kitchen and I am wrapping and putting food away. I hear him ask if she is ready to be a grandmother and she just shakes her head and continues washing dishes. My husband walks out and I can tell he is close to tears. I get really angry and confront her in the kitchen. The argument begins with me asking why she can't be happy for us and she gets defensive and says she is happy for us cause she knows its what we wanted but she says she already raised her kids and doesn't want to be burdened with more. Things escalate from there and I tell she doesn't deserve her son's or FIL and that she is cold hearted for not wanting to be a mother or grandmother. I also say she should have tried to be a better mother. She gets angry which I have never seen before and at this point FIL and brothers are in the kitchen.

I disagree with this because I know how much it hurts him and his brothers that she was never an emotionally available mother to them.

That last part really rubbed me the wrong way. These were young women who really don't need to be told to have kids right now. I felt like it reinforced the stereotype that women existed to make babies. It frankly felt like she was abusing her power as a panelist to encourage girls to go get pregnant. Why did she even have to mention it on a panel about her career? It felt like she had to mention it because that's what a good ol woman does.After the panel was over, I pulled her aside and politely suggested to her that she not mention her kids if she's going to be on future panels, especially if it's to young and impressionable women because it takes away from her career achievements and makes it seem like women just exist to have kids (I said it more politely than that). She asked if I had kids. I said no (cf by choice). And she made a really bitchy comment along the lines of \"why are you telling me what my accomplishments should be then\". I, still trying to be polite, told her that the panel should be about her career. We went back and forth for a bit.

I had recently become vegan over a month ago, and I take it fairly seriously (although I don't force it on other people at all or judge for their particular choices in food). Carl would say I'm one of his best friends, so I didn't think there would be any harm in asking.\"Will there be any vegan options at the reveal?\"\"Now that was a stupid question and you know it.\"It was a weirdly vitriolic response to a simple question. I would have dropped it if it was a simple \"no, sorry\", but I pushed the conversation further. He told me I should know better considering how he eats and how his girl eats and how her family is (despite never meeting her or being told much about her). He also said I should cook and bring my own food for this party. I wouldn't have the biggest issue with this either, but the hostility and dismissiveness at my question made it hard to blindly go along with it.The conversation turned into a one-sided argument with him getting more annoyed and dismissive. He started putting words in my mouth and saying things like \"I'm not ordering a buffet just for you\", \"You're overreacting\", \"I'm not going to let you make demands to me\" and the like. I was nervously laughing/joking about the situation since I think it was absurd that a small question caused the conversation to escalate so much. Jamie would chip in and ask why was it so hard to get a vegan burger for a few bucks, which would annoy Carl further, causing him to explain how much this party costs and how he's not in charge of food and how I should take it up with his girl (who I don't even know).Eventually Carl told me and Jamie he didn't want to discuss it further, leading to one awkward as fuck ride back. Nobody said anything for the rest of the car ride. I was upset since I don't think I did anything wrong, yet just that question spawned the most uncomfortable conversation I've had with Carl, all over food. So, I was dropped off, said very little to Carl still feeling upset and all, and haven't spoken to him since.Additional info: Carl would be my ride to/from this party since I don't have a car. He lives out of town so leaving the party and walking home isn't doable. He also implied he expected me to help clean up after the party (this has happened before).

	"body" : "[To avoid gender based bias, I'm using third person pronounces]I recently became very health conscious and started dieting. I find it difficult to ignore junk food laying around the house so my solution is to never buy them. On the other hand, my partner is going through a stressful job search and has been eating a lot of junk food to cope.Although we are both young and otherwise healthy individuals, I see this as a problem, both for me and for them. This makes my life difficult when it comes to avoiding unhealthy food, and I see their unhealthy lifestyle (junk food is apart of it) creating mood/mental problems for them. Accordingly, my partner agrees but don't view it with the same priority or impact, and therefore don't care much about addressing it right now.Over the past 6 months or so, I've gradually brought up this topic and tried and get them to be healthier, or at least stop eating junk food. This started off as something like \"hey let's put some of these junk food back on the shelf\" while at the grocery store, to \"I don't want any of that, make sure you'll eat all of it if you're going to buy it.\" My partner's reaction to it every time has been either neutral or of implicit agreement. To be fair, none of these conversation was a \"sit-down\" conversation. They were all casually discussed but never met with any resistance.Objectively speaking, I'm a health nazi. I measure and eat the exact same thing everyday, go to bed early, take a bunch of supplements/nootropics. My partner is the exact opposite, their diet isn't \"bad\" in the traditional high-calorie/processed-food type of way but is malnourished. They will sometimes over consume until their stomach hurts, or eat nothing but ramen. In terms of junk food, they eat about 2 bags a week.Few weeks ago I took it a bit further and told my partner that I will throw out any junk food I find in the house and that they can either hide it or stop buying them. They agreed at the time (although they later said it was out of curtsey). Leading up to the event, I found some of their junk food in a drawer and even reminded them to put it away.Today, I found another bag of chips in the pantry, I threw it out and then told them about it -- they immediately went into a rage, slammed a water bottle to the floor, kicked the trash can, physically blocked my path, and demanded I never throw out any of their stuff again unless I want a divorce.I took this as a threat and became angry as well. I escalated the situation by calling it a bluff. My partner handed me another bag of chips and dared me to throw it away and I did, so here we are.[See my comment below]",

For this reason I've made it a \"tradition\" to introduce my children to the world of sports at around the age of 7-8.With the eldest, Luke(m15) it was incredibly easy. He was always fascinated by knights so he had a natural inclination towards HEMA. He has been doing it for ~4 years now and he absolutely loves it.With the second, Klara(f11) it was a bit of a struggle to find something she gravitates towards, but she was exited to try different options. She tried swimming, football, fencing and eventually settled on basketball last year and has been enjoying it since.Now the issue is the twins Jake(m8) and Abbie(f8). Abbie absolutely hates the idea of trying out sports and Jake has this general disinterest. And the issue is exacerbate by my wife.I spent about 6 months trying to educate them on all the different options. Jake only showed some interest to boxing. I was ready to sign him up but then my wife(f44) insisted that the twins go to the same sport. So we waited until both Jake and Abbie could agree on one and they chose tennis.Well this week they went to their third lesson and... again Jake was apathetic. He told me that he is willing to try it for a while but that he didn't really like it.But Abbie, she hated it. She said she doesn't want to do it anymore. I told her its fine she doesn't like it now, but that she'll have to go for while until she can be sure of her true feelings, and then maybe she'll be able to try something else. It just made her throw a fit, she doesn't want to go anymore, period.The issue comes with my wife. She never saw any benefit towards having the children start sports at such a young age. She says they'll have a life time ahead of them to start a sport just like she did. (she only started volleyball at 17)Now that there is a bit of opposition, she insist I stop pushing Abbie into doing something she doesn't want to. That I don't care about her feelings. And that I'm being an asshole of a father.I tried to point out that they're at an age where they don't know what they want and that it is our job as parents to instill in them a healthy lifestyle.That its ok if Abbie chooses a different sport later on or if later on when she has more agency in her life she quits entirely.

We live several hours away from her and in the years since we have moved here she hasn’t been to visit us once. She has been invited and we have been back to our hometown to visit her, however she says that she is too sick to travel and can’t get out of bed due to her disability. She also claims she cannot work and is on welfare. It took a long time for her to find a doctor who would diagnose her and she did doctor shop for a while.However she recently got on a plane and went on an overseas holiday, where she visited several famous cities and landmarks. This included days of travel by plane, bus and train, as well as hiking and walking around.Initially I was shocked because I have spent the last several years feeling sorry for her and her disability which made it impossible to live a normal life. After seeing that she is actually capable of everything she said she couldn’t do, I feel like she has been lying to us and to the system. To be honest, it really hurt my feelings and I feel betrayed. It feels like she has been using her disability as an excuse not to see us.I also feel as though she should not be on disability payments if she is not actually disabled. I have a deep sense of justice and want things to be fair. WIBTA if I report her for welfare fraud?My partner is mad because he doesn’t want it to cause a rift in the family. SIL and MIL have a very enmeshed relationship, which makes communication impossible. They both get very defensive and things blow out of proportion. My partner has often just ‘taken a hit’ to avoid conflict with SIL and MIL. If I report and she is found guilty, she will lose her disability payments and have to get a job. This will upset both my SIL and my MIL. He doesn’t want to face the backlash from that. I figured that if SIL has nothing to hide, the report would come to nothing anyway.WIBTA?Edit: thanks for your messages and responses. I accept the verdict. I’m an asshole.

So of course I wanted to help out in any way I could, and when she specifically asked for my advice on the baby names she chose, I was happy to help.Kacy showed me this pretty long list of boy names, like 15-20 names, and a few were bolded. She told me that the bolded ones were the ones she was most comfortable using. Most of these bolded names with the most unhinged, abstract names I'd ever seen, names like Fintan, Goban, Liamy, etc. I don't know if it's her culture or something but obviously I had to tell her that she couldn't give her child a name like that unless she wanted him to suffer in life. She said she didn't realize that it could actually create issues but she seemed pissed, and at the time I didn't really care, we didn't speak for a few days but I started to get annoyed that she didn't respond to me just trying to ask her what's going on in her life.The final straw, though, was when she invited me to her BABY SHOWER and I realized she gave her son the name Liamy - one of the names I explicitly said was not fine for her to use.

The ps5 was very pricey and since were not very wealthy my younger daughter Mina wanted to add some money to our saved money for the ps5. Of course she did that voluntarily and I wouldn’t have expected something like that from her. She had saved about 60$ which was great and me and my husband of course were very thankful. However, now Minas birthday is coming up and she wants a new laptop. It costs about 600$ and we first wanted to deny it because we clearly don’t have enough money for something like that but then it seemed unfair that Kate had gotten something so big, so we thought that Mina would deserve that too. I thought of getting a second job for a period of time so that it would be easier for us to pay but my husband had the great idea of just taking some of Kate‘s saved money since it only would be fair. Mina also helped raise money for her ps5 so why shouldn’t Kate do that too. Also we knew that Kate had saved about 150$ which would help a lot. We knew that Kate was saving for some shoes, so we only asked for 100$ so she could keep some for a new pair of shoes. She rejected our suggestion. I got really mad because it would only be fair for Mina and she had saved so much money which she wouldn’t even need if she would just get a cheaper pair of shoes. I said that I would sell her ps5 if she wouldn’t agree. She started crying and screaming at me and calling me „heartless“. I got even more mad.

I have a little bit of trauma related to them but the bigger problem is the dysphoria and how much they destroy my self-esteem. I have never looked good in them, even when I presented as cis-gendered. I offered to cover my tattoos, including an unfinished sleeve and completed half sleeve, and to take out my gauges and various other piercings and she said no to all that.

Another friend said I was being taken advantage of.I tend to believe that relationships, including friendships, take sacrifice sometimes, and I gave up the fight on the dress because the wedding isn't about me, but some people have told me I should have more respect for myself and stand my ground. I've already bought what I'm wearing and it's fitted so it's happening, and that's not changing, but it has left me curious.Am I the asshole for insisting that I be allowed to wear pants?Edit: I'm not insisting on wearing pants anymore, this is a post-discussion question. A reflection I guess. I'm wearing what the bride wants, I just hate it.

He’s very intelligent but doesn’t study that much so his grades are quite average. Last year i made him a promise that i would take him on a vacation to Florida in the summer break if he got top of his class, This really motivated him because he was so excited of the trip (Florida is his dream destination). He told all his friends that he was so excited with this trip and that he always wished of going there. When his results came in, they were amazing. Even he was flabbergasted when he saw his own results. He told me that he’s so excited to go to Florida because if his good grades, i congratulated him but told him that we can’t go to florida because i didn’t have time. I have a hard job which requires alot of time, which makes it impossible for me to make this trip happen. He got mad, so mad that he told me he never wants to see me again and also telling me that he doesn’t want me contacting him anymore because he’s tired of my “bullshit” and that he’s going to stay with his mom. It’s been 5 months after this incident and he still didn’t text or call me. My ex called me about this situation and told me that i put myself in this position and that she doesn’t have my back. The only thing i wanted is that my son got good grades. AITA?",

	"body" : "For some background, I’m 16FtM transgender, and I’ve been out to my family as trans and bisexual since around 2020. I don’t see most of them very often, but they all have me added on Facebook where they see me going by male name, male pronouns, and presenting as a guy in the world.My mother is somewhat transphobic. She’d never admit it out loud, but she hasn’t ever called me by my preferred name or pronouns. Other members of my family have done it once or twice, but my uncle is really the only person consistently calling me by my name.Now, onto the question.Since the holidays just wrapped up, I was carted around to multiple family functions. At every single event, I was deadnamed and misgendered. People commented on my body quite a bit, which obviously would make anyone uncomfortable. But a lot of it was nonsensical. Stuff like “Oh, your chest is growing in nicely!” when I was wearing a chest compressor and 3 layers of clothes. They also asked multiple times about why I do “masculine” activities like sports and why I only play male characters in the school drama club.After many breakdowns in bathrooms and straight up leaving to go to friends, I told my mom I don’t feel comfortable going to gatherings anymore. The amount of comments on my physical appearance coupled with being misgendered has made them unbearable. She told me I was being selfish and that sometimes you need to sacrifice for family. AITA?",

Regardless, as I’ve always been generally good at literary analysis, I feel I did well.I got it back at the beginning of the week, and surprisingly, I was given a 70%. The reasoning given was that although the paper itself was good, I had committed the following cardinal sins: 1) I didn’t include a title 2) I didn’t include page numbers 3) I didn’t use present tense 4) I didn’t use a works cited page.I find the last point to be especially stupid, given I did only reference one text, and was only supposed to reference one text, the book itself. I did in text citations within the essay itself, and didn’t feel the need to include a citations page. Using past tense too, it seems immaterial. The first two, fair enough, but I don’t think those marred the quality of the paper immensely. Those lapses were a product of my sleep deprived brain.I tried talking to the professor, saying I didn’t deserve 30% off, but she said she just followed her rubric. I found this unfair, as she hadn’t even made her rubric public to the students.Hence, I went to the department head, and showed him my paper. He agreed with me that it deserved better than a 70%, and mandated that it be regraded with less severe amount of points docked for the lapses. I ended up with a 92%, but the professor confronted me and said she didn’t appreciate me ‘playing politics’ to get a better grade than I deserve.I don’t think that’s fair, because I do think I deserved a higher grade than I recovers, and clearly the department head agreed.

	"body" : "My husband (38M) and I (40F) are currently separated and headed for divorce.  We've been married for 10 years and have a 4-year-old son.  We tried couples counseling and anything and everything we could think of, but just couldn't make it work.  We are both saddened but trying to work together to make this process as easy as possible for everyone.  At least, I thought we were.Before we separated, I booked a vacation to a wellness retreat in Mexico with a friend for a week. I was feeling so overwhelmed with work and our relationship that I needed to find something to look forward to for myself. This vacation was paid for with our joint account and my husband had agreed that I should go.  Of course, this was when we were still trying to make things work.  The vacation is scheduled for the first week of December.We are currently splitting time with our son with each of us taking him for a week at a time.  I am staying at our house and my husband is staying with his parents for the time being.  They only live 30-minutes from our house so it's not terribly inconvenient.Last week, I called my husband to remind him that he will have our son the week I am on vacation even though that is scheduled to be my week with him.  He said he had been meaning to talk to me about that.  He said he will watch our son that week, but that he wants to have our son for Xmas this year since it's unlikely we will be celebrating it together.I told him that is incredibly unfair and unreasonable and that we will need to discuss that further before we make any decisions.  He said he's already doing me a favor by being flexible about swapping time with our son and with him letting me stay in the house without him, so it's not unreasonable to expect me to compromise on some things too.It turned into an argument with him telling me that he's already paid for half of my vacation because it came out of our joint account.  He said that I can't expect him to be flexible about this stuff and not compromise anything for him in return. I told him that keeping me from our son for Xmas is too far and he told me that if I feel that way I should just cancel my vacation and we can keep the schedule the way it is.But he knows my trip is non-refundable and how much I need a trip like this.  He also knows that I don't have anyone else to watch our son for an extended period because I am NC with the majority of my family.I told him he is being petty and not helpful and that I thought we were working together on this sort of thing.  He said he is working with me, but he's not going to let me have everything my way anymore and that I need to start making concessions on things too.He told me I am being selfish about this and need to realize that my happiness is no longer his #1 concern and that he's only thinking about making things easier for our son.",

	"body" : "My girlfriend's 30th birthday was coming up and in the weeks leading up to it she has been hinting that she wanted a new pair of heels and has been obsessed with 2 pairs at shop at our local mall.She has hinted it many times, and shown me pictures of a general style she was looking for and certain brands, they all cost around $300-500. It was not out of the ordinary but I found it a bit expensive. She was never specific about brands or anything just wanted a certain style of 'gladiator sandals' and had certain brands she considers more comfortable.I managed to order a replica of one of the pairs she found in the mall from a China. The packaging was less fancy but it was essentially the same shoe. I work at an industrial hardware company and often white label products end up being the same item made at the same factory and have various brands slapped on to them later.I gave her the shoes before her birthday diner at a restaurant with some friends and she was very happy even though there was no packaging. She did not ask me where I got them from or the price or ask me if it was the shoe she had seen in the shop. She did mention that they felt a little different than in the shop but probably needed breaking in.Unfortunately as we walked to the restaurant, one of the heels broke off so I assume it had some kind of defect and she had to walk awkwardly for the rest of the night.When we got back she asked me to exchange it and I mentioned the seller has a no exchange or return policy but that I can buy her another one. She was surprised as she thought they did returns but then when she learned it was not the same shoe she had seen in the shop, she got upset and accused me of deceiving her even though I never claimed it was the same shoe she had seen.AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for wanting my husband to skip a concert and visit my family instead?",
	"body" : "I (41f) and my husband (45m) have been together for 14 years.  In that time, my father has come to visit us once and has never seen our new home.  I try to visit him once or twice a year but due to him having a farm and animals, it’s difficult for him to make the 2.5 hour trip to the city where I live.  He recently retired and is finally able to stay a night away so he reached out and wants to come see us next weekend.  My husband’s reaction was to immediately get frustrated because that night won’t work for him because he bought concert tickets ‘for us’ six months ago.  Keep in mind, I don’t even like the band and the tickets were inexpensive.  He suggested that he just find someone else to take and go to the concert anyway.  I got upset, saying that it hurts my feelings that he wouldn’t even consider missing the show and that my dad has only come up once in 17 years and it’s a big deal to me. Keep in mind, the last time I made the journey to visit my father, husband stayed home.  He often stays home when I visit my family, even though his mom lives in our neighborhood so we see her often.  He said that was between my dad and I.  I started crying just thinking about having to explain to my dad that my husband wouldn’t be joining us because he was choosing to go to a show instead.  It feels rude and awkward, and like a display of how little my partner cares about my family.  I said he is being selfish and he said that I am being selfish.  So, who is right?  AITA for wanting my husband to forego the concert to spend time with my dad?Update:  Husband agreed he should miss the show, knowing how important this visit is for me.  I insisted he go ahead with his plans.  He took two days off this week to finish painting and working on our home in anticipation of Dad's visit, which I appreciate so much. Dad will arrive tomorrow at noon.  We will probably play some chess, show him around our home and then get him checked into a suite at the hotel where I work before going out to dinner together before husband departs for the show.  He will check out a friend's brewery in the and then third wheel with a couple he's known since high school and doesn't ever see. I can recognize that my intense emotions about my dad finally visiting clouded my ability to see things from husband's point of view.  Husband was very able to see my point of view, and was thus willing to give up an evening of entertainment in order to support me during a highly emotional and important time, if needed.  98% of Redditors made the focus my dad being an absent parent and not about me being a person with an absent father needing support from their partner.  I disagree that I am 'the asshole' for having needs, and I'm thankful that my partner is more understanding than random strangers, who I will never again ask for opinions.  Lesson learned.",

We have to decorate our house a little bit, we were discussing which color to paint the dining room, it took us about 20 minutes to discuss and the neighbor's bethroom was used twice in those twenty minutes.We wondered why the bathroom is on this side? because all the houses were built in the same way, that means the side where the neighbor's bathroom was, that side should have been their sleeping area. Some people would find it strange that what is the big deal in this, but I cannot even think about the place of eating near bathroom.If I see the bathroom while eating food or hear the sound of toilet, then I start vomiting, I don't know why I am like this but I can't change this.I don't like it but I can't judge how someone else's house is built so I ignored but the neighbor has to go to the bathroom twenty to twenty five times a day. he poops and farts so loudly that it is heard all over the dining room.I was feeling nauseous, so I went to the neighbor and asked if the one uses that bathroom had any medical condition. Hearing this question, the neighbor got shocked and said that it is her son's bedroom and her son is very healthy. I thought that he must have eaten something wrong, so I let it go and we got the color work done in our house.After a week, when the workers were about to leave, I asked them if that boy still uses the bathroom all day and to my horror, he does uses bathroom all day. I thought of talking to the neighbor after discussing with Nick; I explained my problem to her and said that if she can get his son's room changed.The neighbor started shouting on me, she said that it's her house, so I should'nt try to dictate which I did not do.

I would say Emily seems to like Jane a lot so we have all been getting closer recently.The thing about Jane is she doesn't wear make up. Like at all. She also makes no effort to dress up or anything (she shows up in a hoodie almost everyday) and always looks tired. When we talk it doesn't actually seem like she is actually tired and it just seems like she is just not making any effort to look good. She still looks alright, but it definitely seems like she doesn't think twice about her appearance before coming to school.I told Emily about this and she seemed to agree but she said it seems like it's because Jane is not that confident in her looks or something and that she will try to work with her on that if she wanted. I feel like that's just an excuse. So when I saw Jane I asked her why she doesn't bother to fix herself up abit before coming to school, I told her it will be worth it and her efforts will show. She just laughed a bit and started saying how makeup isn't for her and she is okay with having a shorter routine before coming to school.I told her well everyone tries to look good so she coild try too but she still wasn't listening much.

This is about the most recent interaction with my neighbor regarding my Corvette and not my previous interaction from three years ago regarding my second car which I use specifically for the winter that had a broken exhaust which I fixedSo I’ve had my 1980 L82 for 6 years now, when I first got it I drove pretty much every day that I could, but now I drive it less often maybe one a week now. When I first got my vet I left for work at 6:30, but recently for the past 2 years I leave work earlier at 5:45This is the 2nd time she has caused a seen, both times the police were involved, she the only one in the neighborhood who wakes up from my cars (broken winter beater & corvette), I pass by 4 more houses after hers, my neighbor next door said he didn’t hear my cars but he hear her screaming lol, yup she came over after I left, banging on the door screaming about my 2nd carShe called the Police, they told her to never do that, to go onto someone’s property at 6AM to bang & scream on the doors & windows. when I got home I was informed the police officer said I had 2 days to get my 2nd car(winter beater) fixed, I was already finished welding my new exhaust that same day that she came screaming after I left, I install it when I got home after work. If she waited one more day then no one would of had to see her like that.few days before I had an officer pull me over wondering why my 2nd car(winter beater) was so loud, I told him I’m welding a new exhaust, he let me go without a ticket or warning but he told me to hurry up, if another officer pulls me over I could be told to it fix it within a timeframe, I would have two months to fix it but normally it would be two weeks to fix it but he said because of Covid right now they changed it to two months (November 2020) when I got home I heard that this officer told me I had two days, I was highly skepticalNormally I carpool with a coworker so we can both save on gas but At the time I had working hours that were not the same as my coworker so I could not carpool with them for two weeks, So I drove my Corvette, on the second week she decided to come banging on the Doors, ringing the doorbell, banging the windows where people slept, and she added some thing a little extra in this time, giving the finger to everybody and sticking her tongue out while making weird faces.So my family called the police, she was told already not to do this before and she was warned if she does it a third time she’s gonna be in trouble. The officer asked was my car modified in anyway and my family told the officer that it’s stock, all original, not modified and that I have a the paperwork to prove it, because my car is a classic car and it’s not modified the officer told her there’s nothing he can do because I’m allowed to drive it when I want to and at work, she starts screaming “he’s been ruining my life for 6 years.I’m not doing this to annoy her, because I don’t care about her I just want to enjoy my car that’s all, i’ve never floored it in front of her house eitherEdit: information regarding the First event with my neighbor goes as follows.My winter beater exhaust broke one day and so I Called a few Garage around my city and they were all busy for 2 to 3 weeks till I could get an appointment because they were changing winter tires constantly. When I described to them my situation they said it would take a brand new exhaust which would cost almost $2000. At the time this was during Covid in November and getting any parts delivered to you for your vehicle could take a very long time, I had another Garage during Covid have to order a gauge cluster for one of my cars and it took them eight months to get it, so I thought to myself who knows how long it’s going to take to get the exhaust and plus it’s $2000 I can probably make it cheaper myself and faster.On top of the fact I hadn’t worked in six months because the place I worked closed for six months during Covid so I had to live off my savings and stimulus checks and when I went back to work I had no money especially not $2000 to waste on a brand new exhaust when I could make it for a little over $300 which is what I did.At the time in my mind I didn’t have a choice to continue driving my car even though I knew it was very loud because the exhaust was broken on my winter beater car, and I knew that if I chose to not drive it I wouldn’t have any other way to get to work because I didn’t have money to get another car and I didn’t have no lifts to get to work and I didn’t have the money to even rent a car.so it was either lose my entire livelihood to let my neighbor sleep nice and sound or fix this exhaust as fast as possible, I was lucky that I had a friend who let me borrow the garage when they weren’t using it because they had a car lift to then fix and adjust the exhaust until it was finished and I did that for as long as I could in his garage till he said I had to stop for the day and normally that was around 2 to 3 hours a day sometimes only 30 min though.I didn’t know what other to do in that situation if you would’ve done something differently let me know that",

We have always wanted kids and last year we were lucky enough to finally be able to start our family when my wife found out she was pregnant with our baby boy. We were having a lot of trouble on what to name our child because we had such different ideas for the babies name, but we decided to not stress about during the pregnancy and wait until she had our baby to decide the name.After a while of deciding, I had decided that I thought it would be good to name our son after my recently deceased father whose name was Francis. I thought that this would be a perfect name that we would both agree on since she was extremely close with my dad when he was still with us. Before I could tell her about my idea for the name, her water broke and she was having bad contractions, so I rushed her to the er and forgot about the name entirely.She went into labor and ended up having to get an emergency C-Section, which was obviously very unplanned. Afterwards, to try to clear my stress I was doing the paperwork and decided that I would put down the name Francis as the babies official name so that when my wife  was okay after the surgery she wouldn’t have to worry about choosing the name. In this moment I didn’t realize I had totally forgotten to even tell her about my idea for our sons name.This is the part where I realized that I might be an asshole. When I told my wife about the name, she instantly flipped out at me. She screamed at me “You know the name Francis makes me uncomfortable since it’s my exes name!” I knew her ex from a previous relationship had the name, but I didn’t realize it was that serious and it had totally slipped my mind in the moment. Trying to keep her calm, I said “Don’t worry babe, it’s not that big of a deal. It’ll all be okay.” she instantly screamed back at me “It won’t be okay! My son is going to be walking around for the rest of his life with MY exes name!” In the heat of the moment I shouted back “Well it sounds like to me you are still a little bit caught up on him!” After that she screamed back “Just go!” And I knew that there was no point in arguing with her anymore.She hasn’t talked to me much since and we just got home from the hospital and she still is giving me the silent treatment.

I also don’t constantly think about my wife’s exes, so it truly slipped my mind going in. I understand that we can change the name, and I plan on talking to her about it.

	"body" : "My (66F) son, Adam (34M) is autistic. He lives on his own but I pay for a lot of his expenses, including food. As a result, I know which foods he buys. Adam has never been a good eater. As an infant, he ate everything we gave him, but starting around age 2, he became very picky. I assumed that he would grow out of it, but he hasn't. I'll explain in more detail about his eating habits in the comments.Over the years I've tried to get him to try new foods but haven't been very successful. I've told him if he keeps eating them, he might eventually get used to them. He says that it's more than not liking them; he struggles to get stuff down without feeling like he might throw up. As a result, he often doesn't attend events such as potlucks, and when he does go, makes excuses as to why he won't eat. As he's gotten older, he's been increasingly less receptive to me trying to talk to him about his eating habits. He says that lecturing him is not going to get him to change, and all it's doing is making him anxious, which upsets his stomach, making it more difficult for him to eat.Recently, he's learned about an eating disorder called Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID). I had never heard of it before but he told me it's a newly-discovered condition. He hasn't been diagnosed but feels strongly that he has it, and it explains why he struggles to eat certain things. He says that since he's learned about it, it's been a huge weight off his shoulders, as now he can simply tell people that he has ARFID, rather than having to make up excuses. I've tried to be supportive and not lecture him about his eating habits, but it's hard. TBH, I wish he would stop constantly explaining what ARFID is as it's gotten rather excessive, but I've kept my mouth shut.I have a friend, Jan, who is one of those people who has a \"strong\" personality. I admit that she can be a bit much for some people. I usually invite her over for the 4th of July. She loves fruit, and always brings things like strawberries, apricots, and peaches when she comes over. She doesn't understand why Adam doesn't like them. At our BBQ, Adam tried to explain what ARFID was. Jan said that she's never heard of it and to stop making excuses, and if it really is an eating disorder, he should take steps to overcome it, and it starts with eating healthier. I instinctively said \"She's right. You really should try to eat healthier.\"I knew immediately that this was a mistake. Adam said \"I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT!\" and stormed out. I tried calling him several times, but it went to voicemail. Over the next several days, I left him voicemails, texts, and emails saying how sorry I was. He finally called me back earlier today. He was still very upset, and told me that he wishes I could accept that this is how he is, and if I'm going to keep lecturing him, he doesn't want to be around me!Hearing him say this really hurt. I of course want him to feel comfortable around me, but I also worry about him. AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for reclining my flight seat & making sure my family does too?",
	"body" : "I (M38) was flying with my Wife (F35) & 2 Kids. We were in the middle seats with a whole row to ourselves. I normally keep my seat reclined once we are in the air and excepting the times for meals or drinks. This is what I did this time too. Peeked a little at the back and reclined my seat. The moment I did so the guy at the back said, \"Hey don't do that?\". I asked, \"Why, what's the issue?\". He replied, \"Keep your damn seat straight!\". Frankly, I was almost inclined to put it straight just for a while to avoid an issue, but his tone triggered me. Still, I calmly said, \"That's my right. You may call the Air Hostess if you want & clarify.\"The Air Hostess comes, and he says I am not comfortable with the seat reclined & to my surprise the Air Hostess asks me to straighten my seat. Almost on cue \"And bless her smarts!\", the lady exactly in front (let's call her T) reclines her seat.I immediately say, \"But then you will have to ask the passenger in front to also straighten their chair.  The Air Hostess leans towards \"T\" who immediately pipes \"And the one in front of me also.\"I continue, \"In fact please either declare that we all can't recline our chairs or allow it.\"The Air Hostess sensing everyone's interest immediately says I can't do that it's up to you guys. You can recline your seats if you want to.My wife does also by this time and I do the same for our kids also who are between us.Another guy from the back chimes, \"Hey you should be considerate and keep the chairs straight.\"I reply, \"As I said that's our right, you keep your seat straight if you feel so.\"The guy behind me mumbled something but that was that for a while.He tried jabbing his knees on the chair but I didn't flinch and he stopped after a few minutes. I went to the Toilet after an hour and could see they (3 of 4 in the row behind us) were almost the only ones with their seat back straight. The second time I went after a few hours I noticed that the guy behind me has reclined his seat. I deliberately looked a bit towards him till eye contact & gave a sly smile before sitting. He grumbled something & that was the end of the matter. My wife thinks I am the asshole at least for the last part & reclining the Kid's seats too.Edit: 1Yeah, I agree on me getting angry & doing that part of the Kid's seats & smirking which is why I put the post. So I accept my part but believe this is a scenario of ESH for me & the back guy.However, for others, I think this is debatable because ofI went offensive first because he started by saying \"Keep your damn seat straight\" angrily which triggered all this. Why should I let anyone get aggressive with me? Also, the part where he deliberately kept trying to jab his knees back of my seat.It sounds like some are assuming I was the only one reclining. 90% of the flight was reclining (I observed this time being conscious of this). I might be one of the earliest ones but almost everyone did that 10 mins after the seat belt signs goes off.Kids are too young & busybodies to have even noted what's happening but yeah need to set a better example.Of course, everyone puts it straight during meal times & then reclines again.When everyone talks about the right to comfort, isn't that my right too? After all the front seat is reclined & if I keep my seat straight, I will be definitely very very uncomfortable. That's why I said I am ok with keeping straight if that's the rule or everyone does but no way I am if the one in front of me doesn't.The larger question though remains the same.If the person in front is reclining their chair (which happened in my case) & the back seat one doesn't like it, what should one do:Ask one in front to straighten their seat & do the same then onlyStraighten your seat even if the front one is reclined and travel 6 hours like that!Do what I did & recline your seat irrespectiveMaybe I should create a poll for it in some other group and check that.

	"body" : "Recently, I [25m] was visiting some family, including my cousin [28f], who has a PhD in computer science— relevant later.For some background info, growing up, I was always seen as the ‘smart’ one in the family, which she resented me for due to wanting that title herself. She was a lot more studious than I am, and got a PhD, whereas I ended my schooling after my bachelors due to not liking specialization. I’m currently a filmmaker that has been surprisingly successful, and she works at a hedge fund doing quant work.Regarding my opinion on her, I think she’s quite smart in her niche. However, she lacks what I see as traits of a more generalized intelligence— being quick witted, adaptable, open minded, and exploratory. Every truly intelligent person I’ve ever met has been funny and a genuinely interesting person, and I don’t see that in her. She’s more what I would call a ‘sweat’— she works hard, and is talented in her niche, but lacking the originality to be truly intelligent.Anyhow, when I visited my family, she began needling me about how now she has her PhD (the last time I had seen her, she was still in her program) I had to admit that she was smarter than me. I shrugged it off mostly, but she began demanding that I ‘admit’ she’s smarter than her, so I responded that PhD or no PhD, I don’t think she’s exceptionally intelligent or more intelligent than I am.This caused her to fly off the handle, and she started yelling that I was just a jealous AH who couldn’t accept that a woman was smarter than her. She furthered that she was confident and secure in the fact she was more intelligent than I was.I pointed out that if she was so secure in her own intelligence, my disputing it wouldn’t bother her that much, and the fact she needed me to validate her shows she’s not particularly confident. She just got angry again, called me an AH, and stormed off.AITA? I think she shouldn’t have started a conversation about her intelligence if She just wanted me to sing her praises",

I 16M live in a small local area and I have had a lot of trouble with this officer in the past. A few years back I was in a shop and he accused my friend who is from african descent if he took a shit in shops elevator which of course is not true and he just started accusing him of doing that and saying that my friend apparently recorded him. The community officer then proceeded to record my friend and asked for his name and how old he is. Bear in mind it is not just me and him and there is about 6+ of us yet he only targeted him. The next day this community service officer went into the toilets when we all went after school to go to do our business and decided to record us in the toilet which I’m not sure is even legal baring in mind this was a couple years back when we were 14. Skip to now time and today I was waiting for my bus with 2 friends while drinking a lucosade sport drink (uk version of Gatorade). While opening the bottle the cap slips out of my hands and falls onto the floor. A few seconds later the community service officer goes in my face and tells me I need to pick it up and put it in the bin. He was rude about this trying to get into my face and after I told him no which might be bad but to me he was being disrespectful by getting close in my face and in the past had treated my friends and me badly. After he then threatens to tell my school I kick it into a storm drain but because there is a muddy puddle above it the cap just floats there. Then he tells me to pick it up and put it in the bin I say that there is no way I’m touching that muddy water. At this point the bus had come and while I was trying to get on he was holding m back and I eventually missed my bus because he kept grabbing me.

It was, in fact, not a one time event and they proceeded to have such parties every weekend. I was already livid but just last week I discovered the were using an outlet on the outside of my house to power their ridiculously large speakers. So, naturally, I uplugged them and them and my neighbor (23\"en-bee\") approached me, cleary \"tripping balls\" and asked why I \"broke their flow\" so I responded saying \"go f*ck yourself, I'm tired of your constant noise!\" They told the whole neighborhood (who had somehow not heard their racket or had managed to tune it out) and now I am uninvited from any cookouts until I apologize. However their other neighbor (64f) is on my side. So, aita? Edit: I should clarify that the 23 year old (which I have been informed in the replies in non-binary) has lived in the neighborhood since childhood, their parents still live in the neighborhood and they are renting from a family friend.",

She doesn't know how to write or read (EDIT: she is not an immigrant), doesn't speak a lot and when she does she speaks like a child. We thought she was just shy at first, but apparently she is like that with everyone. She doesn't have a lot of friends, other people ignore her or don't like her, and she doesn't seem to care that much. Jack says it's because of some mental problems she has, but she really is just rude. For exemple, everytime we ask her a question about her life she anwers \"i don't know\" and laugh at us.

My family and I didn't care, it's his money, however he started to buy her a lot of things not so long ago. Jewelries, clothes, all kind of stuff.

Alex is also paying a portion of our rent and bills and has her own room, but works in the dinning room as her own room doesn't have space for a desk.Since she has been living with us, she moved all her toys (gaming consoles and a laptop) with her and on more then one occasion I have noticed her gaming instead of working. I have made comments about it, but she said her work is really quiet at the moment and she has nothing to do while she is waiting, plus it helps her to relax. She would also take ages to come to the dinning room for dinner and when I ask her what she was doing Alex would say she was playing a game and she didn't see a problem in her delay since the food is still not ready (I don't like Alex in the kitchen as she always makes too much of a mess and makes very smelly food, so I have told her while she is under my roof I will handle the cooking). All of this has been bothering me and it makes me think she is addicted to the gaming, plus all her toys are taking way too much space.So yesterday while Alex was on a cinema date and gym with her partner, I have collected all her consoles, games and laptop and gave them to my other daughter and her son since she can't afford to buy a lot of nice things for my grandchild.Alex came home before me and after I returned I saw her in tears with her boyfriend trying to calm her down. When I asked her what is wrong she said she beliefs we were robbed as all her tech is missing, that's when I told her I gave it away as she was spending too much time gaming instead of working and is clearly an addict.Alex ended up shouting at me, calling me an asshole, saying I don't understand what I have done and if I don't return her \"toys\" she will file for theft since it cost more then 5k to replace it all and she doesn't have that kind of money. She has also mentioned it helps her with her depression and anxiety but I can't remember her being diagnosed with any of it.

This conflict is between me and my younger sister Rita.So I am single and plan to be for a while, but my sister Rita wants to get married one day and have kids and live her dream life. Now I'm not denying that she won't! She has many great qualities that men want in a woman: she cleans when she's bored, she loves cooking (hates baking tho idk why), she's kind of a peacekeeper and is soft spoken, she wants to be a SAHM and not work, and above all else, she's beautiful! Everyone loves her and supports her wishes but my only problem is she doesn't go out! She never leaves her house except for work, college, and groceries, and she has never made any male friends or advances on men.I've asked her why she's never tried at least talking to men if she wants to get married and she's used the same excuse \"when the time is right, I'll find him.\" LAME! I've tried inviting her to parties but she was always uncomfortable or hid somewhere so I kinda stopped doing that.Anyway a few days ago was Rita's birthday and she asked for a few things so me and my siblings split up who would get her what while my parents wanted to just give her a cash gift. I ended up having to gift her a specific handheld vacuum cuz her current one can't pick up her cats fur anymore. So instead I got her almost $150 worth of new makeup and a new dress and matching heels. I was proud of my gift so when it was time for her to open presents, she opened mine last and when she did, she was shocked to say the least. I told her \"now we can go to parties together again, I can teach you how to do your makeup\" but she was not happy. After the party, Rita told me I can have my gift back because she didn't need it. She said that she thought it was thoughtful but not the right kind.So this is where I might be the AH, I yelled at her saying she was ungrateful and was never going to find her dream husband if she stayed at home all day and that I was only trying to help. She said she didn't need help and again \"in due time, I'll find a man worth a home-cooked meal\" whatever that means. I yelled back that she's delusional and that with the state of the world, she'd never find a good man.The rest of our family heard us yelling and told me to leave her alone. They could tell I wanted to say a few more things but I knew I shouldn't even tho I was so mad so as I left, I just told her I hoped her dreams never came true if she wasn't gonna try to present herself. My family's been distancing themselves after they told me my behavior was disgusting and uncalled for but again I was only trying to help and it wouldn't hurt her to maybe try talking to someoneSo AITA?Edit: ok I get it, you all think I'm evil but for those of you who are saying gross things, I am not incestuous or anything of that sort, that's disgusting.

It feels like I'm a non existent human being now as I know when they go out for stuff together and are enjoying time together. I currently don't have a working car as of right now so me being around people is kinda a rarity currently and I miss human interaction with other people. What annoys me is that they sometimes say hello to me when they see me but will flat out just ignore me right after and go on to whatever they are doing. I'm pretty pissed in general cause it feels like a slap to the face and that I am just an accessory for what was my boyfriend as I was the one who took him and his brother to his sisters apartment for hangouts as well as other places in general as both of them do not have transportation either.Am I the asshole?",

My sister (25F) and I have had a rocky relationship for a lot of that time where she has treated me poorly at times. As a result my husband (30M) doesn’t trust her or like her but has been respectful. I accept his feelings but obviously love my sister.My sister applied for a tourist visa to come visit me. She came in November. Very quickly my husband noticed she started talking to and hanging out with a man who is in my husbands friend group but not friends with my husband directly.My husband was upset because he claims she deceived us by telling us she wanted to come visit me. But he let it go and I supported my sister. They got engaged in December. It caused a bit of a fight because I was happy for my sister and didn’t understand why he couldn’t be.He claims that this is very shady and she’s likely using this guy too. He’s been very mean making comments about how this is the fifth foreigner she’s been engaged to etc.He asked my sister if she planned on leaving at the time that she told CBP she was leaving, and the time her passport says she must leave.She said no. He told her to get out of our house she’s not welcome to stay here anymore. Her fiance came and picked her up, and they’ve lived together since.My husband and I talked about it and he claims that her doing this casts a lot of suspicion on to our relationship and risks my naturalization. He says that he worked hard and gave up his 20s for us to be together and I’m risking all of that for my sister.He keeps bringing up that she blocked me for a year, has hid things from me, and more. He’s bringing it up because he thinks she will do it again. He said she hasn’t changed because everything she’s done from the moment this trip was planned has been a lie.My sister apologized for all that. When I tell him that he says that he told me that would happen when she cut me out of her life. He says “I told you as soon as she needs or wants something from you she’ll be back” and that I should be suspicious of her.He has told me he doesn’t want to ruin our relationship but he said I shouldn’t trust her. My brother passed away so I don’t want to lose my sister over something stupid. My husband said that’s her decision and I should stop jumping in front of the train for her and stand up to her manipulation.My sister says she is going through the process legitimately here but my husband said that’s not how it works and she’s an illegal immigrant.He told me I can’t go over to their house. He claims this guy is a jerk to other women, and he’s upset that this started because this guy was telling me about his problems when he was drunk at a party we went to. He said I should have shut him down and told him that it’s not appropriate to talk to me about his problems. I introduced him to my sister that night.AITA?",

I shockingly enough ended up looking at baby clothes even though we are fully stocked. I just can't help myself. My husband had gone over to grab some laundry detergent and bleach while I wandered the racks. After he came over we continued to go around the store together making sure we have everything and can avoid a store for the rest of the week since I was there was a possibility of going into labor any day now. It's also just a few days until Christmas and I have three other kids at home so obviously plenty to do. Today is my kid's last day of school so it was a now or never kind of deal for us.After we grabbed all of our items we headed for the check out area we realized we could get out of the store faster by using the self check out based on there only being 3 cashiers open and the lines being several people deep. The self check out line only had one person in it so we lined up behind her. After standing there for a few moments, and older woman, maybe late 50s early 60s got in line behind us. She commented about my pregnancy and asked when I was due. I told her any day now. She then proceeded without my consent to try and touch my belly. I took a step back and told her I wasn't comfortable and to please not do that. My husband got between us while she called me selfish and ungrateful. I do not know this woman and have never seen her before. Jason told the woman that I was uncomfortable and it was my belly so it was my decision who I let touch me.When I say this woman blew up at the both of us it's an understatement. She began yelling and screaming obscenities so Jason and I made the decision to leave without buying anything and going to a different store. She followed us out of the store and kept yelling. I was scared and didn't want to go to the car knowing she was following us. Jason stayed between me and this woman the entire time and handed me the keys to the car. The woman called out to me ask I walked away again that I was a bitch and she hoped my baby and I both died in labor. I lost it and against my better judgement yelled at her and told her she needed to learn that the world doesn't revolve around her and her feelings and not to touch anyone without their consent. I was furious.When we got home I texted my mom telling her what had transpired and she told me I should have just walked away rather than being an asshole to a stranger \"this close to Christmas.\" I told my mom that my job as a mom is to protect my kids and I felt that I was doing just that. She sent back a long paragraph about being the bigger person and respecting my elders. I've not responded but am now questioning my reaction to the ordeal and feeling like I may in fact be the AH.",

He was in an intensive care unit for 10 days.Ever since the accident my boyfriend has been paying all of his bills including his medical. He’s been there for all of his appointments, he has a whole notebook dedicated to his medication’s and diagnosis.The issue I have is, his brother just recently started working to pay rent. If he is capable of taking care of himself and can work back at his previous job, I’m wondering why is my boyfriend still paying for everything for him. He has his credit card in his wallet!On top of finding out all of this information, living with his brother I’ve found out how ungrateful and disrespectful he is.The first time I blew up on him, was when he was calling my boyfriend a N***er and a mother fucker for 10 minutes straight. He is always telling my boyfriend how he is never there for him and that he needs to be because he was there for him a previous time before.My boyfriends response to it is that he’s just mentally ill. He doesn’t know what he’s saying because of his traumatic brain injury and that he is not himself anymore. I’ve been around him long enough to believe he is just being manipulative and acting entitled. I think he’s putting off being put on disability so his brother can continue to baby him by paying for everything.Another thing is he’s a complete control freak, if I anyone lays anything outside our bedroom he will go on an anger spiel demanding us to pick up after ourselves. I’ve already had a problem with him throwing my things away. He takes up 80% of the house because all he does is sit on his ass watching tv in the living room. I’ve resorted to just staying in the bedroom because I had enough of hearing his complaining how no one listens or gives a damn about what he’s going through.I’ve listened to him for a year I no longer have sympathy for him anymore. I think he’s being a mooch and manipulating his brother and everyone around him to feel sorry for him.He was previously going to live with his Aunt when the landlord threatened to not renew the lease. I think my boyfriend should stop being his caretaker and make him live with his Aunt. He’s getting in the way of our relationship and at this point I’m thinking of breaking up with him because of his brother and his disrespect.Am I the Asshole?Edit: I know I could’ve wrote this better, it was quickly wrote out of anger and frustration so I do apologize.

	"title" : "AITA for wanting my wedding in Jamaica?",
	"body" : "Ever since I was little, I have wanted to have my wedding in Jamaica. After getting engaged in December, I spent night and day researching destination weddings in Jamaica. When I came across Sandals Montego Bay, I knew the resort was the perfect place for my fiance and I to get married. My fiance just wants me to be happy and was fine with the idea, while the rest of my family and friends weren’t so satisfied. The resort would cost at least $5,000-$7,000 per couple during their stay, with an additional $1,000 per person in airfare. Additionally, no kids are allowed at Sandals resorts, and the resort is strongly geared toward couples only - there are no singles rates, and exceptions are only made for singles attending a wedding. Due to the cost and restrictions, my fiance's mom, my three grandparents, brother, uncle, cousins and the friends I invited cannot attend. As of right now, there are about 20 people attending my wedding, but I am fine with it because it is at my dream destination. One of the reasons I chose it is that the wedding is basically free, and with a certain number of booked rooms, my fiance and I will not have to pay for many of the costs of our trip. We normally wouldn’t be able to afford to go there. Some of my relatives and friends have complained that they want to be there to support me, but they can’t come because of the cost, distance, and couples-only rules. They’ve asked if I could have a wedding closer to home or do something else, but I only want to have the wedding at the resort in Jamaica. I believe my wedding should be the way I want it. My fiance supports all of my decisions, but sometimes I question if I am making the right choice because so many of my friends and relatives can’t be there. I wonder if I’ll look back at my wedding and wish my grandparents, brother and other loved ones were there. Maybe I should just have my honeymoon in Jamaica, or choose a less expensive/closer destination so more people would be able to come. I’m just really excited to get married on the beach, and spend the week there with my fiance/husband. I’m not planning to spend a lot of time with our guests after the wedding. I think the resort will be a fun place for everyone, and after we get married, I just want to be alone with my husband. I have told people this and I think they understand. I was happy with my decision until others began to question it. Now I’m not sure if I am doing the right thing. I am starting to think I’m the asshole for excluding family and friends from my wedding because I chose an expensive, international destination that means they have to take time off work and away from their lives to attend. My choice means people who could have come to my wedding if it were held at home can’t come. AITA?",

My dear son, James (32M) is following in my military footsteps. James is an officer (rank O-3) in the USAF, flying tanker aircraft, and his mother and I are his biggest cheerleaders. With that being said, James is not planning on flying forever; right now, he is seriously interested in becoming a medical doctor for the Air Force, and specializing in oncology. He’s thinking about sending in an application to the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences for their MD/PhD program. And, to be quite honest, I don’t approve of his new career path. If he does get accepted to USUHS for their MD/PhD program, he’s going to be a student for 7 years! I’ve asked James if he’s aware of how much time and effort his dreams entail, and he tells me that he’s not naïve…but of course, he’s just saying that. It’s just a total 180 from flying and I don’t know if pursuing medicine will make James happy. He’s never been interested in medicine or life sciences, and he’s always been obsessed with engineering and aircraft. It’s only in 2023 that James had seriously brought up medical school to me and his mother.Back in Thanksgiving, I had a chat with him about his future and what’s best for him, and he got really candid and told me that I’m being “way too overbearing”. James has experienced a lot of trauma in his military service; a few of his closest friends have died, some from cancer, and some from other causes, and my son brought up these deaths as part of his motivation to switch careers and go into medicine.Am I really being overbearing if I don't want my son to pursue such a difficult, challenging career path?",

She would lock herself in her room and not shower for days. She wouldn't leave her room like ever so to her credit it's not like she was stinking up the house, but it was pretty disgusting obviously so it became a bit of a joke between our family.Anyway, two days ago my sister brought two girls she's apparently friends with to our house. We were eating dinner and talking and one of the girls mentioned something about a project they were doing for a class and I jokingly said that my sister should make a project to see if she could learn basic hygiene. Little sister said that she knew how to already, and I told her to shut up because she went days without showering.Our brothers laughed and even Mom chucked a little but then out of nowhere sister got up and left the table. The two girls and one of my brothers went after her. It was kind of awkward but we just continued dinner. The girls left after half an hour or so.Yesterday morning, my brother asked to talk to me and mom and said we were assholes in the dinner and that little sister probably felt humilliated in front of the first friends she brought home. Then he said that we were being cruel to constantly make fun of her for something she did when she was 12.Mom thinks brother is overreacting because he has always been overproctetive of little sister, but that maybe we should hold off on the jokes for a while because she's a bit more sensitive and it might affect her more than we think.I haven't met sister since the dinner so I assume she went off hiding in her room again. Brother thinks I should apologize but I'm not planning to.The way I see it, it was just a joke like we always make and one that little sister has never explicitly asked us to stop doing. I guess I can see the perspective that she has always had a bit of a low self esteem and so maybe jokes like this don't help that. If she had asked us to stop we would've, but she didn't.

She looks like she could be in her early 20s but she’s in her early 30s, she’s tall and thin but has got baby face going on which makes her look a lot younger than she already is. I assumed she was my age or younger until I found out her age on the night out.She brought her boyfriend with her who genuinely looked like he could be in his late 40s, long beard, tall and muscly and fat at the same time (like imagine really tones arms and back but huge belly kind of thing). He looked like he could be her father.After a few drinks, I’ve noticed she’s been getting tipsy and he’s been way too protective of her.When she went to the toilet, I followed her and asked if she’s okay and if she needed any help.She replied that she was fine. I tried to gently steer the conversation on her relationship and told her it’s really creepy how some guys go after younger women and she agreed that I’s creepy sometimes. And I mention how her boyfriend looks like her dad and it seems like he might be controlling her.She looked at me like I had two heads and asked what the hell did I mean by that. So I opened up and told her that he’s old and someone so young and inexperienced as her is in danger of being manipulated and getting into a toxic relationship and I said that if she needed help getting out, I was there for her.She told me I was being presumptuous and to leave her alone. I said that I understand that it’s difficult to see the age difference as wrong but it truly is.Honestly, I didn’t expect that but she was fucking rude after that. She told me to mind my own fucking business and told me her boyfriend is the same age as her and she won’t be taking relationship advice from someone she met a week ago (she was on annual leave until then).I told her I didn’t believe her and it’s okay to be defensive when faced with reality but she should know I am there for her regardless. She said ‘fuck off weirdo’ and stormed out of the bathroom. She whispered something to her boyfriend and they laughed and she did the same to one of her work friends.I’ve tried talking to her at work but she told me she didn’t talk with assholes and I should stop assuming things and accuse people of being creepy without knowing anything.I kind of feel bad but I have had good intentions and wish she’s see it. It’s not like I could’ve known they were the same age, they look like they’re 20 years apart. I still think it’s creepy he went for someone looking so young though.

Anyway, we gathered a few nights ago at my grandparents' place for Mother's Day.  After dinner, we decided that it would be fun to play hearts.  Growing up, my grandmother was great at this game, and she won frequently, but in recent years, she can't keep track of the rules, and she makes some pretty basic mistakes.Well, in the middle of a game, I could tell that my grandmother was struggling.  I'm a very competitive person and try to seek out any advantage I can, but tonight I was on fire.  I was winning games easily.  I couldn't believe my good luck, and I even did some mild teasing with each win.  I was really proud of myself, and I let everyone, including my grandmother, know that there was a new sheriff in town when it came to cards.  I even pointed out their mistakes at key moments in each game.  However, as the final game was wrapping up, a few family members pulled me aside and told me that what I had done was inappropriate.  They were going easy on my grandmother and giving her more of a chance to win!  I was completely floored.  I could not believe how pathetic this was.  They were ruining the integrity of the game just so someone who probably wouldn't remember playing might be marginally more likely to win.  And then they were blaming me for it, like I had done something wrong.I looked at my relatives and laughed in disbelief.  I told them that there was no way that I would \"go easy\" on anyone.  I said that I would play at the same skill level I've always played at, and I suggested that everyone else do the same.  They told me that I was being selfish, but I told them that they were being childish and that my grandmother's disease would only get worse from here, so what was the point of throwing the game?  She already couldn't remember playing!  They said something about wanting to give her a few more wins before she got worse, but I thought that the whole things was ridiculous.  Finally, I threw up my hands and said \"I don't have Alzheimer's!\" and walked away.My parents called me today and told me that my other relatives are mad at me and say that I behaved completely inappropriately.  I calmly explained that I am competitive by nature and what they're trying to do is make me someone I'm not by intentionally trying to lose.

One parent is unable to be in the wrong and seems to gaslight in every situation so they are never wrong/at fault, even if it means being hurtful to us or denouncing our feelings.The other is difficult to live w for other reasons, including the people they have as roommates.We went over to visit my brother and have fun. A screaming fight breaks out between brother and parent 1. Things end with him not feeling safe in his own home and looking for a way out (same for parent 1). If he goes to parent 2's house he gets in a different cycle of bs only to inevitably go back to parent 1. I am the only other person my brother has left to turn to. And in the last year, I have seen him get section 12'd at least 3 times, visit multiple mental hospitals, and go off his meds and end up lost in the woods without shoes or a jacket.So that night they were fighting I panicked. I told him to pack a bag and got my partner on the phone (he had been in the car avoiding the fight). He did NOT want my brother to come to our house. I may trust my brother, mostly, but he does not. We had just moved me out a few months ago so my partner probably felt like we escaped.I tried to give my partner a choice but essentially decided that my brother should come with us. That was my bad. I probably should've taken no for an answer but I felt backed into a corner.My brother seems super calm with us and of course asks if staying long term and taking up the one empty room we have would be ok. I've felt guilty for having a spare room and bed this whole time while we've watched our friends and family members face homelessness and turmoil. But my partner doesnt want this so I tell my brother he has to leave after a couple days and now both people are angry with me.

When this idea came up I offered my house to play in. My D&D party for the most part live in places that are really difficult for me to get to. Our public transportation, which is the main mode of transport here, connects them with each other, but not with me.

I have a dog, Blue. She is not hypoallergenic, but half of my family is allergic to dogs and have never had any sort of reaction to her. Q was concerned that she would trigger their allergies anyway, and suggested that we go to a different person’s house. This person also had a, hypoallergenic, dog, and would mean I would have to do a 30 minute bike ride in cold weather to and from the session. Instead, I offered to Q that I would vacuum and dust the house beforehand and keep Blue locked in the basement while we played. Q eventually agreed to this and wore a mask to the session with no issues. That said, I worry that my insistence - which I admit was selfish - could have come across as a disregard for Q's safety.For two final bits of information: Q also owns a non-hypoallergenic dog who's allegedly just \"not allowed in their bedroom\" (that's not enforced), and we were dating at the time.

My parents say that she was overreacting, and I haven’t apologized yet but she isn’t talking to me.AITA? We just have regular sibling rivalry and also how do you edit a post?Edit: I was upset with her bc she has her alarm loud so it wakes her up but our rooms are next to each other and the walls are thin so even with doors shut it wakes me. That day, she had to get up at 6 am for rowing at the lake and she woke me. I didn’t have to be up until 7 and couldn’t get back to sleep (not a problem she has) and I got to bed later than normal (tv program) at 10 but she was asleep earlier.",

	"title" : "AITA for telling my girlfriend she is being immature for not wanting to spend the holidays with my family?",
	"body" : "My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost a year, in fact, Christmas will be our 11 1/2 month together. I am fairly certain that she is my future wife, and I want to do everything I can’t make her happy, but I find that we are disagreeing on this holiday related issue, and I wanted some perspective. We are both 29.I am a child of divorce, and I typically spend Christmas Eve and morning with my father and his side of the family, including his wife and my 2 full and 2 half siblings. This means that we would stay the night of Christmas Eve and spend the morning of Christmas day with them.The problem is stemming from an issue that happened earlier this year. In October, my girlfriend and I attended a family reunion, in which my dads side of the family and all of my siblings and their spouses attended. On one of those days, we all went out shopping as a way to waste time. At one point, we went to a store that sold pajamas, and my stepmom invited me, my two brothers, my two sisters, and their spouses to pick out holiday pajamas that we would wear on Christmas morning. She then proceeded to buy us all PJs to wear on Christmas. My stepmom did not invite my girlfriend to participate in this (even though she was present), and thus did not ask her to pick out a pair of pajamas that she would wear on Christmas morning. At the time I didn’t think this was weird or rude since it was just family (parents, kids, spouses).Later that day, my girlfriend confided in me (tearfully) that she was feeling really isolated and upset that she wasn't included. I don't think that she was upset that my stepmom didn't buy her something, but that she wasn't asked to participate in any way, shape or form. I totally understood her feelings and offered to bring this up to my step mom and dad, but she said no.Fast forward to today. We were discussing our Christmas plans, and my gf told me tonight that she isn’t sure that she would feel comfortable spending Christmas with my dad’s family since she, in her own words, was “explicitly excluded from Christmas festivities”, and that signaled to her that she wasn’t welcome. I.e. she wasn’t invited to pick out matching xmas pjs, and thus it would be weird for her to be the odd one out.I feel like this is totally ridiculous and that she’s being immature, but she is really upset about the whole thing. She really doesn’t have a good relationship with her family, so I think that’s playing a part here, but I just don’t know what to do about this. I’m not willing to not spend Christmas with my family, and she seems upset about it. To her credit, she will be the only person there that won’t have a set of matching pajamas with everyone else, so I get the awkwardness, but I don’t think that’s a good enough reason to skip Christmas result together. I told her as such.Am I the asshole for being upset that she refuses to spend Christmas with my family? What do I do here?",

My sensory issues cause me to not do these duties and I just stick to filling the bags.Last night we were busy and had to start on our duties later than usual and this meant we had to stay longer in the store. My coworker \"Tonya\" (26F) was visually upset and I asked her what was wrong? She said it wasn't fair I only did one thing every night and that we all had sensory issues we put aside to help out and I should push past them too so we could all go home quicker. This upset me because no one ever takes my autism seriously and in the moment I called her an ableist jerk who has no right in making any requests for me to do anything.

Lip service.Anyway, I got a very modest \"they/them/theirs\" button not too long ago and put it on my shirt. Mom saw it and...asked me if \"we have to wear political things in the store?\"I asked how it was political, to which she said it would be the same if she wore something like a political party pin or a \"Justice for [oppressed group] pin. I asked again why it was political or how it compared to either of those. She then changed her approach and said it was unprofessional. I asked how it was unprofessional and got the response \"it just is.\" I asked her to explain how it was unprofessional and she said \"you wouldn't see bankers or wall street professionals wearing a button like that\".I responded that I've seen doctors wearing them. She was getting visibly angry at this point and said that they shouldn't be wearing them. I asked if it would it be better if it was a pin? Things devolved quickly from there: asking if she was going to have to turn her request into a demand, me still keeping my cool despite internally fuming as I'm asking why it's so wrong to want people to address me the way I want them to, to her saying I was giving customers information they didn't need. I eventually asked if I took off the pin, would she refer to me correctly? She said she'd call me whatever I wanted. (Since this fight she has continued to refer to me exclusively by my AGAB despite this). I eventually caved, took off the pin, and went about the rest of my day.Come closing time, I go to leave without hugging her and she tried to hug me when I was heading out. I kept it cold and professional. She told me I'm allowed to be mad at her. I told her that I wish she'd stop pretending to accept me. She looked aghast at me and said she does. I told her no, she doesn't, because of she did, she wouldn't have done what she did earlier, and that I have seen bankers and other \"professionals\" wearing pins, and then said goodbye. She told me to grow up, to which I responded with a very even \"why don't you?\" To which she told me to grow up again as I was walking out the door.Layer that night she tried coming by my house and then called me, leaving a message that said \"I don't care if you're blue, purple or green.

He’s at a curious age and is discovering the world, and I refuse to try and limit him and shut him down for not having the emotional sensitivity of an adult.Politely, I told that mother that I was sorry her daughter was struggling with insecurities, and I found some online parenting articles about building your child’s confidence to send to her so she could use some tips to help her daughter out.She replied and said I was acting completely shamelessly and disgracefully, and I am not able to text her anymore.

We are both not high income but he somehow landed a wife who makes 4x our income and they often go out of the country on nice vacations which I guess he has been sharing with the kids.The kids want their passports now thanks to his brainwashing. I initially said yes because him and my son caught me off guard and started asking me if it was okay one day.  Then I had time to think about it and realized how bad things are in the world right now and I don’t feel like it’s worth the risk and danger having the kids so far away from me and out of the country with their dad and stepmom.  They also need my consent per our custody agreement to go out of the country anyway, and at this point I’d never say yes.So today when my ex asked me if X date was okay for the passport appointment I asked where he is even going to be taking the kids, to which he told me “he didn’t know yet, they just want to get the ball rolling because it takes 3 months just to get the passport and they haven’t planned anything specific yet” which I find sketchy.So I told him and the kids no, that he needs my consent to take them anywhere because of how bad the world is right now and I’d never agree so passports are pointless.  My younger son got upset and my ex got angry also and kept repeating “are you just never going to allow them to go anywhere then?” I never said that, just not right now.So my ex is texting me now saying I’m an asshole and I’m “robbing my kids of experiences” except I never have gone out of the country and don’t have a passport and I am fine, so I don’t really buy it.

My boyfriend is the perfect man he’s tall, sweet and very supportive of me the only problem I have is with his sister (15F) let’s call her Alexa. so for a bit of backstory my boyfriend practically raised Alexa since their mom was an addict and wasn’t around and their dad worked overseas. They are very close and don’t  have a typical “brother-sister” relationship.the problem with their relationship is that my boyfriend is very loving and affectionate with Alexa (which is fine) but what makes me uncomfortable is how touchy they are with each other like every time we go out together she’s always holding onto his sleeve or arm they’re also always cuddling when we watch movies or are just hanging out on the couch which can get annoying because I sometimes just want him all to myself but can’t because of Alexa. I also hate the nicknames he calls her some of them include baby, sweetheart, princess, honey, and “my special girl” in my opinion these nicknames are very inappropriate for a brother to call his little sister and he should be calling me that not her. when I brought it up and told him how I felt he looked a little annoyed but nonetheless told me he‘ll hold back with the nicknames and affection which he did but only for a bit.I also have a problem with Alexa and that’s because of how clingy and dependent she is with him. Anytime she has the slightest problem she always has to call and ask him for help even for the simplest things like “how to change a tire” or “how to make a doctors appointment” she even interrupted one of are dates to ask him “How to Pay the internet bill online” it gets super annoying because she can literally just google how to do it or ask someone else (they have other siblings) but she Just has to ask my boyfriend what’s even more annoying is how my he literally drops everything to answer her calls even when he knows it’s probably something dumb. When I tried bringing this up my boyfriend just said she’s a kid and needs a little help which I can agree with to a certain extent but Alexa is a very smart girl and can figure this stuff on her own when I told him this he got really upset and kinda yelled that he doesn’t want her to struggle and “figure it out on her own” like he did. He got quite after this and went to his room to think, I understand why he feels like this but I really think that if Alexa figured things out on her own it will be very beneficial for her He just won’t hear me out.Anyways this all happened a couple days ago and he still won’t talk to me properly so AITA?Edit: Ok I get it I’m TA I’ve been thinking and decided that I need to apologize to my boyfriend and Alexa thanks to everyone who gave actual advice but to everyone else that is just being plain rude and disrespectful and saying that you hopes he breaks up with me shame on you, seriously none of you know anything about our relationship and what we’ve been through together so honestly just fuck off.But anyways I wanted to clear some things upI am not jealous of Alexa all of this was truly me being uncomfortable with their relationship because to me it was weird and unnatural for siblings to act that way with each other maybe it was the way I grew up but me and my siblings barely talked or acknowledged each other despite being close in age.2.I think most of you ignored when I said they have other siblings  that’s why I was annoyed that Alexa only came to my boyfriend for help when she can ask any of their other siblings3.my boyfriend does not have custody of Alexa and is not living in his childhood home with her and their sibling anymore4.for anyone that was concerned about the questions Alexa was asking my boyfriend shes fine and does not pay for the internet with her own money she’s just in charge of making the payment. She also doesn’t take herself to the doctors she just makes the appointment and either my boyfriend or one of their siblings takes her. She also knows how to drive and has a permit. All of this should be obvious but I guess some people were halving a hard time understanding.",

	"body" : "I divorced my husband, Sam, two years ago. It was my fault, I suppose, I had a fling with a coworker and when it came to light at work, my husband found out and immidietly filed for divorce. We had three kids and the divorce was not pretty. We have joint custody. I got alimony and child support and we split everything we had evenly. Except the house. Since he inherited the house before marriage, he kept it. The way my lawyer explained it to me, he had a direct deposit going into a separate account which was used to pay for property taxes, insurance and any expenses that came up. We tried to get the house, even offered to go lower on the alimony. His words to me were, I'm not giving you the house so you can fuck other dudes in it.Since then, he doesn't talk to me unless it's something about the kids. He doesn't contribute anything to the kids expenses. I had to get a different job and the money I make and the alimony/child support all goes to the kids. He refuses to buy them clothes, school supplies or any activities. He convinced them that he gives their money to me and anything they need, they have to ask me. Even worse, he buys them nice stuff, but only to keep it at his house. They still have their old rooms and they all have nice clothes in the closet, Xbox and toys to play with. My daughters room is now her princess room, with dolls, dresses and anything she wants in there. They can't bring any of this stuff home, it's only for when they're at Sam's. That's why he kept the house, to use it to turn the kids against me. They treat going to stay with dad like a vacation.He bought a boat and takes them out on the lake whenever he can. He made a snarky, now you're not wasting my money, I can afford stuff to me. He started dating some FOB Mexican girl. She's like 15 years younger than him. Like completely taking advantage of this poor girl. But my kids love her. She started teaching them Spanish. They started using Spanish words to refer to things around the house. To clarify, I don't have a problem with her, I just feel like Sam is trying to replace me with her in the eyes of my kids.Last month, they told me they want to live with daddy. All the time. I cried all night after that. I was a mess for a week, couldn't focus on anything. He gets to play this fun dad while he's with them, spoil them and makes me do the actual parenting. I said no, of course, and the kids have been mad at me. Sam didn't argue with me, he just said I knew you'd say no out of spite. Then just left and ignore my texts. He's been so mean since the divorce, I don't even recognize him anymore. Aita for not letting my kids move in with their dad?Edit: added more info",

	"title" : "AITA when I ask my wife to look cute for me….",
	"body" : "Hey all. This is my first time posting because I’m truly wondering if it’s just me. I’m not going to get into excruciating detail so there is no bias. Just a short summary, and from a birds eye view tell me if I’m wrong….For roughly 11 years(I’m 37/M) I’ve dedicated every waking minute to building a life for my family that’s free of stress and worry. I always put the burden on myself. The moto I live by is “if anyone in the family is going to suffer or go without it will be me”I’ve sacrificed every joy/indulgence In my life to get us to the beautiful point we sit today…..but I’ve NEVER limited them in what they want to do. If what they want requires more money I work extra hours to pay for it. NO ONE IN MY HOUSE GOES WITHOUT.I own four houses. All rental properties. 3 are paid in full. Nothing has come easy. I do all the home renovations myself and handle all the tennant calls on top of my full time job. But I’ve pushed through it all to get here.I work 45-50 hours a week at my full time job. Not counting hours spent with the investment properties. I have a good job and also provide the health insurance. My wife doesn’t work and my 2 children are home schooled. Any free time I do have I try to spend as much time with my kids as I can because I grew up in a house where my father never bothered with me. I know what that feels like.My wife has only briefly held a full time job (9months) in 15 years. And that doesn’t bother me. I’ve built  a life where her income is not ever needed unless she WANTS to work. I love that she is home and always available to my children. I don’t ask for anything in the relationship other than my house is clean (within reason with two young children) and that she “gets ready for me” a couple days a week. She is absolutely beautiful.I’ve finally gotten to the point now where I want options if I’m wrong. When I ask her to “get ready for me”. Which really means do her make-up and sometimes where a cute shirt/dress I like when I have a bad day at work, I’m met with the answer of “love me for who I am”. I’m starting to feel taken advantage of. I’ve WILLING and LOVINGLY, given everything I have to this family. My wife and kids literally don’t even know what it’s like to wake up to an alarm clock. Meanwhile I wake up most days at 5. Am I wrong to ask her for what is ,in my eyes ,the simplest of tasks?  To do her make up or simply wear a shirt I love once or twice a week for all the sacrifices I make every day? I don’t do it because I’m “superficial”. But because she is truly the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. And it truly brings me joy to come Home and see her…but again. I don’t feel like it’s a big ask…I’m happy to answer any follow ups and before u ask… yes. I’m very happy with my wife and children and they are my entire world. Of all the things I’ve accumulated in my life nothing means more to me than them.Thanks in advance everyone!",

We regularly go out on every other weekends and have activities which most of our colleagues join into including my colleague Max (33M).Max is a very outgoing guy, extroverted and has been at my workplace the longest (6years) as the turnover here is quite fast. I get along well with him and would consider him my best friend at work. We share banter and have a good laugh and have similar extroverted personalities. Max regularly attends the work activities and is the life of the party and workplace. His wife of 10 years used to come to the activities sometimes (before I joined the workplace) but no longer does since having a baby awhile back.What really annoys is how Max always puts  his wife on a pedestal. He's always going on how about now she is the best cook, has the best looks/figure he has ever seen. A simple conversation between colleagues regarding which celebrity we fancy would be ,\" nah man, no one beats my wife in terms of looks\".  Who is the best looking in the workplace? \" Nah, no one here. I've got really high standards. Have you seen my wife?\". Some of our colleagues have agreed with him, saying that his wife is really gorgeous but I'm sure they are just humoring him. We were going through each others videos on tiktok when another co-worker commented to Max his wife resembled an anime character ( she's slim, long black hair and Asian) and I joked that she's not that pretty pfft. Max got offended and retorted that she didn't need fake eyelashes and fake hair to look passable and that he understood why I needed them.  I got angry and told him to piss off.

	"body" : "My m36 husband \"Tom\" is WFH and I f33 am a SAHM. While he's working he likes to listen to music on his speakers which I don't mind because we have similar tastes in music. Last month he started playing a new game.At first it wasn't a big deal when I could hear him playing during work, then after work, before bed, you get the point. The noises that this game makes are particularly annoying. Yet, for some reason our kids, Chloe 12 and Cris 10 started to love it just as much as he does.He always lowers the volume when I ask, which of course makes me the bad guy in the room until Cris raises the volume slowly over time and it's back again.Originally, this was a blessing. He plays with the kids while he works giving me a lot of time to do my own things. Everyone has been having a good time with it. I overhear Chloe and Cris suggesting things that they should do and Tom gets to teach them about his favorite things in the world, \"optimization\" and \"efficiency\".I've brought up my problem with this game a few times. Tom has suggested sound proofing the room which I feel is a bit extreme just because of me and this one game. Tom can't wear headphones, he breaks out in a ring where the headphones touch his head if he wears them for more than an hour or two. We've tried several different brands and materials in the past. He also has really bad tinnitus so he needs his sounds loud enough to drown it out.After this last weekend of pops and beeps, I couldn't take anymore. I waited until they left for ice cream, of course talking about you know what all the way there, then I took his speakers and cut the cable and threw them in the trash then ran myself a bath. It felt so good at first but then I found myself crying in the tub so ashamed at what I just did. I don't know why I broke like that.When they got back, Tom noticed the speakers missing and told the kids he needed to focus on some work before playing. He came to check on me in the bath. We talked about it and I cried and apologized for being such an AH, but I just couldn't take it anymore. He comforted me and when he was sure I was OK, he warmed up the water again and let me relax.When I got out, I saw him teaching the kids how to fix a broken wire. He told them that he accidentally frayed the cable by crushing it with his chair. I almost cried again.I feel like the AH here but I also don't feel like I had a choice.Edit: While money is not too tight, we are saving to move to a new place. While I know that Tom would pay for soundproofing the room, I know he doesn't completely like the idea. It's not efficient, after all. If anybody knows how to do sound proofing for cheap, I would love to look into that. We were under the impression that we would have to install another vent in the room, replace the doors and have work done inside of the walls and under the floor.",

About a week ago she spent the night at my house, and the next morning she went out and bought us bagels and coffee. When she got back, she sat them on the counter and I grabbed my bagel and coffee and I sat at my computer. She took hers and sat on the couch in the next room about 15 feet away. We could clearly see each other. After a few minutes she asked if we were gonna watch TV together. I simply said no I don’t want to and continued on the computer. I stood up after a minute and turned on music hoping that would be a middle ground, and then went back to the computer. After a few minutes she asked if we were going to eat together. In my opinion, we were only 15 feet from each other, so we were eating together. I didn’t want to be snarky or mean so I just didn’t respond. She finished eating while looking at her phone and left soon after. A few days later she told me that she was upset I didn’t eat with her and that I seemingly gave her the silent treatment when asking if we would eat together. In my opinion, I was just in the other room, 15 feet away on the computer so we were basically eating together. If she wanted to say hi or talk she could’ve just walked over. So am I the asshole?",

I've told her that i need more help multiple times in the past months. She tells me she wishes she knew what to do. She calls me weekly and books my medical appointments with a psychiatrist but doesn't do more. We live far appart and I can only see her every couple months. I know she is doing her best so that is why I feel bad for being mean to her. Furthermore I'm not an easy child as my issues started in my early teens and i dealt with them on my own until I was 18. Because of that I am mean and rude to her when we argue and I'm not sure I'd ever accept any authority from her. So aita for asking her to act like a parent and do more ?Edit : here is some additional info I've said in the comments so you don't have to ask about it. I have had issues since I'm 12 and I dealt with them alone until 18. My mom was emotionally neglectful and didn't do anything when I was being abused in front of her.

I begged her to let me cut his umbilical cord and for him to be placed on my chest immediately after birth. But she wouldn’t let me.

I go inside and just leave it at that and plan to ignore her. But it doesn't stop there. I dropped a bottle of conditioner in the shower that night. She made a noise complaint.

I never once made a complaint about her.The final straw was actually on Christmas Eve. I parked in MY assigned spot (not on the street but in the parking lot) and relaxing cooking dinner at home when I hear very loud pounding on my door. I get startled and get up and answer and it's my neighbor who started to cuss me out again and yelling at me to move my car because she has company coming over and she wants them to park in my spot because \"they have a hard time walking and are elderly\" I ask if they can park on the street and she yells no and tells me to hurry up and says she will tell management I am growing weed in my home (I'm not) if I don't move. I just move all the way to the end of the street but I am PISSED. So I go back home, make a poop in the toilet, take a selfie with me and the poop and then take a picture of my cat's litter box which also has a poop in it.

	"body" : "Me (44M) and my wife have a 16 year old son. To be completely honest, I have always been super strict with technology.5 years ago I put a downtime on his phone and macbook, which to those who don't know, essentially is a screen time and turns his phone and laptop off at a certain time. This includes him not being able to text or call his friends during the night. My wife has always disagreed with thisOriginally his downtime was 7 PM, but we eventually upped it to 9 PM once he got into high school. He's been irritated by this.He doesn't care about the fact he can't access apps during his downtime, but more annoyed that he can't keep communicating with his friends, which annoys him even more when it's summer. We also moved states 2 months ago which has lead him to try and talk to his friends from home more often.However, he does have a playstation downstairs which we let him get on, even when his phone and computer are off (I have tried to put a downtime on his playstation before too but I couldn't figure out how).4 days ago he placed an order on amazon, and 2 days later the package came. I was already on the couch when my son got it from the front door and brought it to the kitchen where he opened it. He pulled out a box of earbuds. He already has Airpods, so I asked him what he needed those for. He told me it was for his playstation, so I thought nothing of it.Later that night, I got woken up at 11 by the sound of laughing coming from the living room, followed by the faint sound of talking. At first I didn't know what it was, but as I became less drowsy, I realized it was my son.I went downstairs and saw him sitting on the couch with the earbuds on, on the playstation. He saw me and said 'hold on' into the mic before taking the earbuds off.I asked him what he was doing and he said he was playing games with his friends. I looked at the screen and saw him in some kind of voice chat with 2 other people. I told him he wasn't allowed to talk to his friends after 9 which is why the downtime exists and he told me he thought he was still able to call them on his playstation since I let him use it at night.He knows the rules I have in place for technology, and I felt like my rules were getting broken so I told him to get off the playstation and go up to bed. He groaned and said 'oh my god bro' before shutting the console off. I watched him go up the stairs, making sure he didn't try to stay down.The next day, to ensure this wouldn't happen again, I took his earbuds and put them in a closet in me and my wife's room in a place our son wouldn't find them. I also went on his playstation and figured out how to disable joining party chats.When he found out, he started giving me an attitude about how annoying I'm being. My wife thinks I'm taking it too far and being an asshole and some close family members think I'm potentially damaging his relationship with his friends. However, I think I'm doing him good.What do you guys think? Am I the asshole?",

He tried not to accept it and said he didn't care, but I told him I didn't want to hear about it anymore and not to test me. He reluctantly accepted it and then went to his room. I, admittedly, lost it and called him pathetic as he shut his door. I called my boyfriend and told him about it, and he said that I should either start treating him as a roommate or stop charging him rent if I wanted to treat him as my son. He told me I can't have it both ways. I tried apologizing, but my son won't talk to me.

It’s a rough adjustment, and there’s nothing that I like at the house, so I’ve been relying on my friends to bail me out with snacks. My mom finally went grocery shopping, at lidl (which I hate, why can’t we go to a giant like everyone else.) Ok, whatever. I come along, we’re about to go, when my sister (9) pops up and asks if she can go. Of course, being her favorite, mom says yes. So we’re already late, and my mom has to go to work in 2 hours. We go shopping, I ask for stuff several times, she says no, whatever. But then, my sister asks for things, and, of course, being the favorite, gets them. This pisses me off, so “apparently” I end up being reckless with the groceries, when I am done unloading the car, I head up to my room. My mom confronts me, and I tell her I’m deprived of snacks and there’s nothing to snack on that I like. She gets angry, grounds me (actively sneaking this RN), and goes to work. I told the few friends I have about this, they are mixed on this, so that’s why I’m wondering, AITA?EDIT: for those pointing out that going to the store is not favoritism, here’s some other stuff: getting an iPod touch at the age of 4 (took me until I was 12.5, had to constantly ask my parents if I could use their devices), getting to go out and do stuff more often then I would’ve been allowed to, and, mom taking her side when I eat pizza she claimed 3 days ago but never touched (that happens quite often), later curfew (mine was 7:30, she gets to stay up till 9)EDIT 2: figured I'd get more support, guess not. but when you're used to eating a certain way for 15 years, only to throw away that entire lifestyle and have to adjust to a new one, no shit I'd complain. plan is to get a job, figure out WTF I'm gonna do with college, move out when I can, and just figure things out from there.EDIT 3: fuck all y'all \"I'm just a dumb kid\" MFs. I should be allowed to eat what I want to eat.EDIT 4: maybe I need a psyche analysis. I don't even know anymore...Edit 5: guess I’m the AH. But wow. These comments are toxic. I was hoping for some form of affirmation, but I guess not. Thank you to the (3? 5?)ish percent who were actually nice about it.EDIT 6/UPDATE: So, me and my mom had a talk. It did not go well. It was a long, heated argument. To summarize, I brought up a bunch of stuff (including things mentioned by you guys in my last post), she called me an ungrateful, spoiled brat, we kept arguing, things kept getting worse, I was sent to my room with no dinner (which sucks, dad was making steaks on the grill), and, as I’m typing this, am snacking on whatever leftovers in my room I have, chips, leftover Easter candy I never opened, anything goes",

As at this point I was the only mother he knew. And my husband was the only father Tara knewThe only issue was that husband parents didn't like me and refuse to address Tara as a grandkid. Which has caused issue because my in laws came from family money and would always buy Blake extravagant exspenive gift growing up.Tara had to watch as her brother alway got the newest and the best stuff and she didn't it cause a riff between him and Tara and they were never really close. And I will admit this cause Tara to be rsther rude and mean to Blake. But I don't think I would be so happy in that situation eitherMy husband told his parents mutiple times to stop unless they plan on buying for Tara as well but they refused to listen.They created a rather huge trust fund for Blake which he has access to in a few months.Now my husband was a very simple guy and never wanted anything to do with his family money even more so after how they treated me and TaraSo we lived a very average life.My husband got very sick and pass 5 years ago And I been on my own with Blake and Tara for that time. My husband treatment before his passing has made it impossible to pay for my daughter tuition to college next year.She doesn't qualify for student loan and has no scholarships.Blake now 24 and will be 25 and will have access to his trustfund in a few months.I mention to him that I feel that his sister should be giving half of the trustfund as she was also my husband daugther(My husband always saw Tara as his daugther and hated his parent's for the way they treat Tara like anything else)Blake got mad and said that the trust fund was just enough to pay for his research trip he had plan to do but couldn't manage to get the funding for.Blake is a marine biologists who study creature that only live deep under the ocean.(To be honest most of them are terrifying.  He has shown me pictures).He has his master in the field but is determined to get his PHD before he is 30.This trip is his thesis project.Which basically it like a final exam for a PHD or something simular to thatBut I feel he is being a little selfish with this and that he should also at least think about his sister in this case.Yes it going take him a longer then he wish to get his Phd but he a young smart guy and will get thier eventually.AITA for thinking my son should split his inheritance with his sister.",

It was a short note saying how he's seen me around and thought I was cute, followed by his name and phone number.

Eventually, after nearly 50 times and months of begging her to take care of her hair, I snapped. I told her I'd be cutting off her red tips as punishment. She didn't mind that much, she just sat down as I cut it.While I was cutting it, I realised that if I cut it shorter, she wouldn't have the same issue with haircare and would be able to take care of her short hair ten times better than  her long hair.So I did that, I cut her hair up to her neck.

I'm concerned about the validity of this relationship because high school relationships rarely last. They are practice for the future. I wanted to properly set expectations so she's not disappointed when he inevitably breaks up with her for someone better, prettier, older, etc. Unlike my son, who is 15, my daughter doesn't put much effort into her appearance, she doesn't care about makeup and clothes and wants to wear the same rags to school every day. After her date she came home overly excited and all she could talk about was Sam.  I told her that quite frankly I'm surprised this he wanted to go out with her and I question his motives. She asked me why I would say that and I was honest with her, most boys at her age are immature and aren't really looking for anything long term, they just want to take advantage or are going through a phase or are answering a \"dare\" from a friend to date the nerd, etc.She blew up at me after that and accused me of calling her a nerd and saying that I think she's ugly and not worthy of a boyfriend. I told her that's nonsense, that's not what I meant. I said I'm just trying to set expectations, not to expect much at her age, I don't want her to be disappointed and come crying to me about how this boy broke up with her. And then I told her I don't think she is ugly but she could put some more effort into her appearance if she wants to keep boys in general, this will help her in her life beyond high school. I said look at her brother, he keeps up with trends, grooms himself well, and I think he's well on the road to success. She can't get by with just wearing sweatshirts and jackets all the time with that one pair of torn-up jeans. She accused me of trying to control her and I said I was only looking after her and trying to set her up for success. I said there will always be girls who are prettier, more attractive, and eventually younger, and boys and men have their pick. if she wants to be considered, she has to put in the work.

He told me he planned to only have a couple beers and then head home to relax until I got home and then we’d enjoy some adult beverages together. His birthday was the upcoming Sunday after his outing on Friday so we planned to celebrate it with drinks on Friday night instead of Sunday since I had to work Monday morning, and then just enjoy a nice dinner out somewhere Sunday evening.Knowing how past occasions have been, I literally begged him to please drink responsibly while out with his friends so we could enjoy our time together and not get into an argument and ruin the weekend. He promised that this time would be different and he’d probably head home around 5:30-6:00.Fast forward to Friday around 6:30 and I still hadn’t heard from him (he usually lets me know when he’s heading home), 7:00 still nothing. I finally call around 7:30 (still out with my mom) with a sinking feeling in my stomach because I’m fairly certain I already know the outcome. Sure enough, he answers the phone with the most slurred “hey baby girl” that it was almost unintelligible. My first thought was that he was playing a joke because there was just no way this was happening again. He wasn’t. I immediately just hung up the phone and my teenager could visibly see how upset and disappointed I was. We continued the evening with gma before heading home around 8:30.When we walked into the house, there he was snoring and passed out on the couch. I didn’t even try to wake him, I just left him alone and went about my night. The next morning’s conversation/argument informed me that “I only had 3 tall beers and a shot” and “I wasn’t drunk, I was just tired and fell asleep”. We didn’t say much else to each other Saturday, so when Sunday rolled around I just treated it as any other day, we did absolutely nothing to celebrate his birthday.Now I’m the bad person for ignoring him on his birthday and hurting his feelings for not spending time with him.Am I overreacting??EditSorry. I’m new to Reddit and wasn’t trying to post in all caps for any particular reason. I would fix it if I knew how.Everyone’s amounts are different, but to me a couple beers is exactly that…. a couple 12oz bottles of average beer. Not almost double the size, tall, higher alcohol content ipa’s and then liquor.I should have clarified that yes, he was driving, which has been one of the main reasons for this ongoing argument every time this happens. I feel like he should have more respect for myself and my teenager than to put himself in a position of unintentionally removing himself from our lives by either killing himself in a dui or spending his life in prison for crashing and hurting someone else.",

	"body" : "2 days ago, I (18F) borrowed my mom (50F) earbuds & forgot to tell her about it. She then texted if I took the earbuds somewhere & I said yes. She sent a long text lecturing me about how I should let people know if I want to borrow anything from them. I said I'm sorry, it won't happen again.Ytd, I left the earbuds on her nightstand where she usually put it, then went to take a shower. My mom didn't see it & decided to come looking out for it in my room.  When I got out, she stood in front of me, holding the condom that I always have it in my backpack (For protection, I'm not involved w anyone right now) & asked me \"What is this that you have here?\", in a very, deadly tone. She's an uptight, traditional Asian woman, so this condom thing def not a \"normal\" thing to her. In my country, you'll be facing serious, shameful comments if a girl has sex before marriage.Anw, I got all up defensive bc I felt like she violated my personal space. I asked \"Why did you go thru my stuffs without telling me?\", she replied \"I just look for my earbuds, since you didn't give it back. Why the hell do I want to go thru your stuffs??\". However I was still so annoyed, and especially because of her attitude about the condom. I guess my irritated tone provoked her, everything escalated into a full blown fight.My dad ran up to stop us. He acted neutral, since we were both so emotional. Then my mom even got more mad, as she yelled to my dad \" Your daughter is acting so wrong here & u still didn't say anything. U never protect me or stay on by side\". She then threatened to divorce my dad, as he had \"Disrespect\" her. She went full on rage mode, all smashing & yelling.Now I feel so guilty bc I feel like if their marriage failed, It'd be because of me. AITA here? What should I do?",

	"title" : "AITA for tapping a woman on the top of her head with a finger because she was browsing facebook in the movies?",
	"body" : "My girlfriend and I went to the movies. The lights go fully out and the movie begins. As in the actual movie, not ads. Diagonally in front of me sits a middle aged woman writing a comment on a facebook post on her phone, with the screen brightness very high. I wanted to let her know that that's not okay, so I leaned forward, tapped her gently twice on the top of her head and quietly said \"Put away your phone.\" I am not sure she heard me because I said it pretty quietly not to bother other people, but I am sure she didn't understand me because later it turned out she didn't speak my language. Either way, she took the hint and put away her phone. She said something to her companion indicating towards her head.After the movie, nothing immediately happened, though I do think the woman and her companion argued whether they should say something or not. Eventually, her companion turned to me and angrily said: \"Next time, keep your hands to yourself\" (in English). Then they stormed off. I said nothing to them.I was then about to comment on the thing to my girlfriend but was cut off when my girlfriend started scolding me, saying I have no manners. We discussed it on the way home and her opinion was that other people's personal space is such a sacred thing that there is never a reason to violate it in any way. She also said that someone being a jerk doesn't give me permission to be a jerk to them. She would therefore vote ESH here.I know I could have only verbally told her to put away the phone but I opted for touching the woman because I didn't want to make a lot of noise, as the movie was already playing. In hindsight, I would have had to say it to her at least twice because she didn't speak my language. I hardly think a tap on the head is comparable to other invasions of personal space like some sort of fondling or a hug. I would have rather tapped her on the shoulder but as she was a row ahead of me so I couldn't reach it.There are just two rules that, if you can follow them, make you an absolute top of the class model citizen in a movie theatre: shut up & don't use your phone. I always make sure I turn off my phone completely well before the movie starts. Excessive, maybe, but I would be absolutely mortified if my phone started acting up in a movie theatre. You'd also never see me browsing my phone after the movie has already started. If you were, I'd like to be immediately notified that I am bothering others, be it a tap on the head or some other way. In that case I'd be embarrassed as hell and make sure to apologise after the movie.So, was I an asshole for touching to get the woman's attention?EDIT: Alright, the general consensus is that I was in the wrong for touching her, and I accept that. There are other, better ways to get someone's attention, and you can be sure I resort to them any time some asshole uses a phone in the theatre.On a more worrisome note, several people are threatening violence. Not cool. Some people are trying to make this some sort of sexist thing, that I wouldn't have done so to a man. Not true. It even appears that these same people think that I wouldn't have done it to a man out of fear of being punched. I actually find it kind of sexist to think that any man's reaction to being tapped on the head would be instant berserk mode and punching. Please don't do that to people that annoy you. You are just creating a bad stereotype out of all men.Several people seem to think that it's perfectly okay to use a phone in a theatre. Yeah, you people are assholes. Even at lowest brightness it's very distracting in a completely dark room. Not using a phone in a theatre is the very basic etiquette that I thought all children are taught, but I guess not. Movie tickets are very expensive these days, please don't ruin the experience to others thinking that your social media or even dying grandma is more important. Thank you.",

	"body" : "For a little backstory, me (20) and my boyfriend (22) have been together for over six years. We have been living with his dad for the past two. me and his dad have always had problems with each other but it’s never been vocalized. We just stayed away from each other and out of respect for my boyfriend a lot of the things that his dad did that I had a problem with I kept quiet about because he asked me too and the problems are having to tell him where we’re going, every time we go out we’re stopping what we’re doing to do whatever he says, but the biggest problem is having people around me and my boyfriend‘s daughter(1) that aren’t good for her to be.Two days ago me and my boyfriend decided to take my daughter out to eat at Denny’s a little bit after we got there my boyfriend got a text from his dad “I don’t know which one of you thinks I’m stupid but I don’t appreciate it” so he texted him asking what he was talking about no answer so we finished eating and then went home. When we got home we went to put our daughter down for a nap in her room and saw that the brand new heaters cord was cut. The reason we got her little heater was because when we woke her up her skin was freezing We had clothes on her we had blankets, but her room was cold so I went and bought her a heater.So I told my boyfriend that he either needed to say something or that I was going to and he told me that if I wanted something to be said that I needed to say it myself so I took the heater and I went to his dad and I said “ I’m gonna try to talk to you as respectfully as I can but why did you think it was OK to cut the cords to my daughters heater?” He then got up went to the house and started shoving bills in my face saying that he’s the only one that’s paying bills. which I understand if he needed help with bills all he had to do was ask. Which I had stated.Then he proceeded yelling at me, saying that it’s his house he can do whatever he wants. We didn’t ask him if we could buy it. It’s also a good thing to mention that he wouldn’t of known there was a heater, unless he went into the room when we left because the heater was off because she wasn’t in the room And the heater we got two days prior to him getting the electric bill would not have affected the bill so I told him that he owed me almost $40 for the heater that I had bought to keep my daughter warm because he did not want to turn the heat on.he then threw the heater and told me that he did not owe me anything that I owed him my life so I told him that if he didn’t change how he acts and change who he brings around my daughter that when we move out, he’s either not gonna see her at all or he’s gonna have very limited contact and after a little bit more arguing me my boyfriend and my daughter packed some of our stuff up and went and stayed in a hotel, so am I in the wrong?",

	"body" : "So, I've always struggled with my weight. I've seen the way the world treats fat people and it's often unkind. The last thing I wanted was my kids to go through the same B.S., so I've been very particular about making sure they eat healthy, get good exercise, and use portion control. (I don't put them on extreme diets or anything crazy, just good health habits that every person should have and that I ideally would've had in my own childhood)My son Rhodes just turned 16 a couple weeks ago. He is not overweight, which is relevant later. He's been doing great in school and recently got a nice job for the summer. To celebrate, Wednesday I let him go down to a nice local sandwich shop he likes. I gave him the card I use for occasions like these and waited in the car for him. When he came back he tried to hide it from me but he had a case of hiccups. I guess I was a little overreacty, but I asked him how much he'd eaten. He shrugged so I made him give me the bill so I could see.He bought two sandwiches, a large shake, 2 turkey and cheese salads. Which is a lot, and I told him he really only needs to eat one sandwich and one salad, they're huge at that place, but he didn't pay that much attention to me and just fell asleep on the drive home. And as you probably know that's like the worst thing you can do after you overeat, it's better to walk it off.The next day at breakfast I made him a bit less than usual. It wasn't much less but he noticed and asked why. I told him the truth, he's been eating a lot more lately (not just at the sandwich shop but in general) and I don't want him to get into the habit of getting 3rd and 4th helpings, or double sandwiches or eating entire pizzas, basically the kind of shit that lead this country into being as grossly obese as it is.I didn't realize the way I was saying it came off like I was calling him obese/fat in front of my other kids (I know, I know it seems obvious now but at the time I truly did not notice, I'm used to talking honestly like this among my friends). The minute I heard them laughing I told them to quit it, it's good advice for all of us, not just Rhodes.As I said, he's not overweight at all, he's nice tall and thin. I didn't want him getting bad ideas so I pulled him aside later and said I didn't mean to insinuate that he's fat. He said sure but since then he's been very careful eating around me, choosing very healthy foods and leaving a decent amount behind. It's not a bad thing, but we used to talk so openly and now he's a lot more distant.AITA for my comment? I think I was a touch careless but I genuinely, genuinely did not mean any harm.",

She told everyone except me, my grandpa, and my mom. Keep in mind that she'd had the proposal planned for months (according to her sister). She held the proposal not even thirty minutes away from where I live.Over the past few years, Mary's gotten sort of...full of herself. She's taken full advantage of what she's found at the intersection of Luck and Hard Work, and acts like that makes her god. It feels like she's been snubbing me, grandpa, and mom more and more since then, and not being invited to this proposal was the last straw for me.Of course, I wouldn't have been able to attend because I was riotously sick. It's the fact that Mary didn't even say anything. Not even an invite for my mom. The three of us used to be very close, even took care of each other when we were sick. It all started to unravel after Mary got that fancy job and girlfriend.Now that wedding bells are ringing, all of a sudden there's a a fancy, lacy invite in my mailbox and a link to a wedding registry sitting in my most recent text messages. After considering it, I sent a polite rejection for the RSVP. (For the record, I wrote something like, \"I'm sorry, I won't be able to attend due to a long-term obligation. Wishing you and Soon-to-Be years of happiness.\") After some more consideration, I decided against purchasing anything from the wedding registry, though of course said nothing about that.Word got 'round quickly and the only people on my side are my mom and grandpa. Mary's sister is calling me bitter and entitled. Mary's Soon-to-Be called me jealous. Other family members are saying I'm not owed anything, etc.And you know? Maybe I am being petty here. Maybe I should at least send a token gift. It's just a proposal and we're obviously not that close anymore. Yet, at the same time, it just sits wrong with me. Invite who you want to your special events, but don't go holding out your hand for gifts from the people you didn't invite.What do you guys think? AITA?ETA It looks like responses have slowed down. Thanks for the feedback. While I need to be kinder about it, I think Mary and I shouldn't speak to each other anymore, and I also would prefer not to speak to certain family members anymore. (There's a lot of history here that I can't detail.) I won't be attending the wedding, but I'll get ahold of some local wine Mary likes and a nice card with well wishes.",

She graduates this year, in about a week or two I believe.So I get home and she shows me that she committed to Washington State University. For those who don't know the college is located in Pullman, WA, which is in the East Part of WA, in the middle of nowhere (you'll see what I mean if you look on Google Earth).She showed me her booklet she got from the school when she visited. She showed me a few pages and told me about how excited she was to make new friends and study, etc..I chuckled and told her not to be excited. She asked why, and I told her that it's in the middle of nowhere, six hour drive from home and there's nothing to do but party there. I told her she should have committed somewhere in Washington that's in a city that's not only known for being a college town, because living in the middle of nowhere isn't something to be proud of.I told her that UW is a lot more fun, I guaranteed, and there were actual people around there and I chuckled again.I was expecting a little chuckle back, but she got up (and looked annoyed), and went upstairs.

I used to smoke like once a week or twice a week at most a couple years ago.My friend & I had a bet a couple years ago that if i went without smoking for 6 months (no causal ciggie or IQOS or vape or joint) then she’d go blondeIf I, however, smoked even once during those 6 months then I’d go blondeI sadly did smoke a few times during those 6 months and we have a lot of mutual friends who kept it a secret. I honestly didn’t view the bet as a big deal. It was more of a jokeAnyways 6 months passed and she didn’t find out from any of our mutuals that I smoked so she bleached her hair and went blonde (not fully blonde like we had specified in our bet but I didn’t force her either bc obviously she wasn’t even meant to go blonde in the first place).Anyways fast forward to 2 years later ie now we were drinking and I casually mentioned “oh yh remember when u went blonde? I actually smoked all along”She didn’t react or say anything. The next day she was furious and was so upset we don’t even speak anymoreWas her reaction valid?

Shane I had to have users of Reddit make me understand what’s wrong and why it’s wrong instead of realising the obvious on my ownI realise mg only option here is to go back and apologise and go blonde (and that’s the right way to do things). But I just can’t go blonde. The thought of ruining my hair with bleach over a bet gives me the ick. What a shitty way to think I know, but then that just makes me think that she probably deserves better friends than me",

	"body" : "Every year my (19F) mom goes all out for Christmas. I mean, it’s extreme. We have three trees and our whole house is filled with Christmas stuff. She works in a very demanding industry (music) and December is the only time of the year that is really “slow” with her office being closed the last two weeks of the year, so she goes nuts baking and decorating and basically pretending to be a 50s housewife since it’s the only time she really can.We did have nice birthdays and when we got older she would take us to musical festivals, but they were always genres I really didn’t like, but I guess it was fun going backstage.Every year we also do a “Christmas craft” on Christmas Eve. We have done it since me and my brother (16M) were little. Things like doing gingerbread houses or making ornaments.This year is my first year away at college. I still live in the same city as my parents, but I wanted some independence so I decided to live near campus. My parents supported this and do cover my tuition and rent. My friends were not going home for Christmas so they decided to throw a party on Christmas Eve. I told my mom I wanted to go to the party instead of coming over Christmas Eve. She sounded bummed, but I told her I was getting too old for her Christmas obsession anyway and wanted to do my own thing. I went to the party and had a ton of fun with my friends.I went to my parents house for Christmas day. I admit I was a bit later than I said I would be because I was hung over, but I still went. I asked my family what they ended up doing for the Christmas Eve craft and I found out they made wreaths out of a bunch of my mom’s ornaments as well as vintage ones she went around to thrift shops to find. I was upset. My mom keeps the craft a surprise and if I had known it would be a special one I may have shown up! I asked my mom why she didn’t tell me and she said “You know it's always a surprise.” Since she had already bought the supplies for me to make one before I decided to go to the party, my mom ended up making two. I asked her if I could have one of the ones she made and I would keep it up in my apartment all year. She said no because she “likes hers and wants to keep them.”I also noticed she didn’t put up my Christmas stocking with everyone else's. I had the gifts I would normally get, but the stocking was put away. I asked why and she said “I thought you were too old for my Christmas obsession.”I got upset and told her all this Christmas shit annoys everyone and she is being petty. My brother and dad said not to speak for them because they like doing the Christmas craft every year with my mom and like all her decorations. I told my brother that maybe once he grew up some he would also want some independence and not want to waste his Christmas Eve gluing shit.Christmas was awkward of course, and I ended up leaving before NYE. My brother still says I’m being an asshole, but I think he’s just sucking up to mom, so AITA?",

I had made it known from the beginning that I would appreciate if my bf would drive me to the airport. This was just a natural expectation I had, as I’ve always had family members drop me off or pick me up at airports my whole life. It was just what you do. My bf however considered this to be a huge ask. On his side of the family, there is a very high level of caution when it comes to driving, and that a drive to JFK is something you just don’t do, it’s expected that you just take public transportation or call a car service. My bf himself also has a decent amount of anxiety when it comes to driving. My point was that, we would be driving at a very quiet hour, it would give us some extra time together before I leave, and also it’s just not that bad of a drive! He said ok, and that he would drive me, then on the evening of said he didn’t think he could handle it and called me an Uber.During my week away, my bf had considered that maybe he was overreacting about the drive (I had told him how empty the highway was during my Uber trip), and said that he would pick my up at JFK when I came home. As the day closer, I could tell he was getting more hesitant about the drive again, and I was getting anxious that he would back out again. He kept hinting at not wanting to do it and said he had begun to feel back pain after a night at the casino with friends. Fast forward to the evening of my flight back East and I get the call that my bf will no longer be picking me up at JFK.I was with my family in this moment and was visibly upset and disappointed. As I said, everyone in my family just drives each other to the airport so they were genuinely confused as to why I hadn’t been driven to the airport to begin with and I won’t be getting picked up a the airport on my way back. My sister was so upset that I was upset and decided to talk to my boyfriend herself and convinced him to pick me up.So my bf did end up picking me up at JFK after my flight back. He was however very stressed and continued to express that he and all of his family and friends thought it was absolutely crazy that I expected him to drive the hour from southern CT to JFK to pick me up.Am I the asshole for expecting rides to and from JFK from my bf?",

I parked in front of a house like this and thought it would not be a problem as obviously they are not parking in their fenced front garden so I knew I was not blocking a car from returning.I carried my shopping down the street and as I was unlocking my front door I began to hear a woman screaming from up the street. I realised she was shouting that some c*nt had parked in front of her house and 'it's illegal, don't you know the law' and that she would smash the car if it wasn't moved in thirty seconds.I shouted up the street' oh I'm so sorry, I just needed to carry my shopping ,I'll move now' (although I had previously no intention of moving) and walked back to my car. Luckily she ran back into her house as soon as I was approaching so I didn't have to talk to her as I was a bit scared since she sounded so aggressive. I moved my car to another spot much further away because I didn't want it to get smashed up.My perspective is that it should be fair game to park in front of her house as, having forfeited her driveway to make it a garden, that's just on street parking now which is a free for all.

I cleaned the whole thing again on Wednesday night.Story: This past Tuesday (it was Sunday night when this was posted) my boyfriend’s cashiers check for his car came to the apartment. He put it on a clean and empty counter with the thought in mind that I would see it, realize it’s important, and leave it somewhere safe or keep it on the counter. Well, while I was cleaning the kitchen again on Wednesday I didn’t see this check, or just saw paper and thought “oh it’s out on the counter it must be trash,” and threw away the check for his car repairs. He is going tomorrow to take out another loan until the 90 day window clears when the check comes up as uncashed and the amount reverts back to the original balance on the car loan. He says it’s my fault for throwing out the check, and if I asked a group of 100 people they’re all agree with him. So, I came to Reddit.I just want to know, AITA for throwing away the check, or is he TA for leaving such an important piece of paper out in an area that was getting cleared again soon.TLDR: AITA for throwing away a what I didn’t realize was a cashiers check (my boyfriend left out on the kitchen counter) while I was manically cleaning the apartment before our yearly inspection?",

	"body" : "This is a complex question, so I'll try to be brief, but some background information is necessary to explain my perspective.My middle daughter (now in her early 30s) has always had a strong will and mind of her own. She gave us a lot of grief growing up. She was the only of her siblings to ever sneak out, date secretly, experiment with drugs, and she has a mouth on her sometimes and talks back to people without hesitation.She also was always the brightest of all our family and excelled at school easily, despite those behavioural hiccups along the way. We spent a lot of time trying to get her on a path to success because we knew she had a bright future ahead.She moved out for college, stayed away for grad school, then moved even further away for more schooling. There were some spaces in between degrees where she worked but she never came to live back home like her siblings did. All her other siblings are married, have careers, houses, and kids. Middle daughter is still working on university projects. Whenever we ask when she will have a PhD she gives vague answers.We have reason to worry. She was once in an abusive relationship that lasted many years. He didn't hit her but he was a huge creep and nobody liked him, we told her all the time but it was like she was brainwashed. When she got out of it she moved cities and even said \"You were right, mom\" about it so I vowed to keep a closer eye on her.She recently visited. She has a boyfriend now for several years who I have only met once when I flew to visit them. He never comes to visit us and she says he can't afford time off work.He works a low level job, has only a high school diploma. He had a difficult upbringing with violence and is estranged from his family. I can't imagine what they have in common.My daughter is now saying she does not want children or a home, and that she is taking psychiatric medication of some kind. I was immediately worried she was in another controlling situation leading her to make such drastic decisions and I brought up out of concern that she should reconsider whether this is a real match for her or whether she's being controlled again.She was furious, and her mouth went off. She didn't even want to hear my reasoning that I wrote here and went to bed early. Clearly, I caused a fight, but since I don't know this man I just can't assess any other way whether she's safe.Did I cross a line, since she's an adult? I still want to talk about it but not if we will just fight",

Honestly, looking at her at first glance she doesn't look pregnant, she looks really fat so it makes sense why people wouldn't think she's pregnant.I told her to be more understanding of other people and that she doesn't look pregnant. She scoffed at me and said I'm being rude and she's just trying to be friendly, and that she's obviously pregnant. I was like, \"No you aren't. And if you stay the weight you're currently at then you'd still struggle the same even if you weren't pregnant. It's entitled.\"She said I'm a rude person and inconsiderate, and started having tears in her eyes.

	"body" : "(i'm using a burner account since my ex friend knows my reddit account)I (22) graduated college not too long ago and was preparing to get my degree with my best friend (22M) (who we’ll call Parker) and my crush (who we’ll call Jamie) since grade 11 (23). To be clear, I had met and become close with Parker my freshman year of college in a lecture about movie physics that we bonded over. I had known Jamie for longer, and all three of us became pretty close, forming a sort of friend group of four, including Parker’s roommate, who we’ll call Riley (22). Although, I saw Jamie as not only a friend, but a potential love interest, so I considered Parker my best friend.After finishing our exams, I was absolutely overjoyed to finally graduate. I decided that life was too short to waste by keeping my feelings from my childhood crush hidden. A few days before graduation I decided to tell Parker that I was going to finally confess to Jamie after years of waiting. Parker was suspiciously quiet, only responding by staring at me and taking a sip of his drink. When I asked him why he was just staring at me, he just shrugged it off before changing the topic to our friend group’s camping trip to celebrate our graduation. I was a little suspicious about how he was acting, but I let it go.//Our friend group had decided to get ready for graduation together so we all met up at Parker’s apartment. Riley was making lunch in the kitchen and asked me to go find Jamie and Parker, who I hadn’t seen in a minute. As I was walking in the hallway I heard something in Parker’s room, where I saw him kissing Jamie. I didn’t know how to react. I could only stare in shock. It felt like hours, and it felt like there was a painful lump in my throat. I think he might have heard me gasp, because he eventually stopped to look at me, with an embarrassed look on his face. He nervously laughed before telling me that he and Jamie were dating. I was just disappointed at first, but I couldn’t stop myself from asking how long. Parker then revealed that they had been dating for seven months.I. Was. Livid. Parker had known for over 3 years about how I felt about Jamie, and I couldn’t believe he would betray me like this. I’m not the most outspoken person, so I was always nervous about telling Jamie, WHICH PARKER KNEW, so I couldn’t believe that my best friend would steal my crush away from me. Not only this, but then would keep it a secret from me for so long!We got in a large screaming match where I said many things I regretted, such as calling him a cheating son of a b**h, a treasonous bstard, and undeserving of love. Before Parker could try to lie his way out of this one and give me some flimsy excuse, I stormed off.He could’ve at least apologized for breaking my heart, or done literally anything at all to try to make things better.

Change my view. \" *The first day this guy moves in , he parks his truck directly in front of my mailbox , even though there is room in his driveway and in the street parking in front of his house. There is a tree and a flowerbed outlined with rocks showing where the properties are landmarked. I went to check my mailbox passive aggressively hoping he would notice , he did and said he could move the truck if I need to , flabbergasted by the sheer lack of awareness and consideration and being the first time this happened, I threw my hands in the air , didn't say a word and walked inside my house. He moved the truck .Lady Friday, I notice his woman's car (she drives a black suv) parked just in front of the mailbox,  a whole maybe 6 feet in front of the tree and flowerbed outlined by rocks, maybe 3 feet from the mailbox , so much so , a mailman would not be able to deliver mail, and my landscapers would have to park cut where the car is parked. Mind you, it is illegal to park on our street , it is a narrow country road. Also , it bothers me that they are not staying on their side and taking a parking spot that is on my side and infront of my house should I need it. Also, there was enough parking for one car in their driveway, and two cars in front of their side of the duplex unit, on the street parking in front of their \"house\".  I leaned towards not saying anything,  but my fiance convinced me I needed to say something and even offered herself to say something,  so not trusting her to speak carefully , I volunteered myself for the duty.I went over to the house , and his truck pulls up when I had originally planned on asking whoever was in the house , being their was also an unfamiliar white car parked in the driveway.  He stepped out of the truck , I shook his hand and introduced myself , him being relatively new ; we had not spoken yet. I then explained to him:\"sometimes my landscapers go in there(pointing at the spot in front of my house , literally in front of my big front window on the second story of my home , clearly across the obvious tree and flowerbed outlined by rocks that my landscapers cut all the time) and asked him : \"can you move the car please?\" He then said yeah , walking back to his 1 car garage in his twin ranch style duplex , \"she was just cleaning for a second , don't worry about it.\" So I said ok thank you . Then he goes into his garage and I hear him scream \"it's just a car, oh lord!\" Or something incredulous like this. I then humbly walk back to my house,  and he comes angrily staring me down with him glasses on . I disregarded it , and went back inside my house . He moved the car back to his side .AITA for asking my neighbor to move his car after the second time ?Edit: Thanks for the judgment guys. Alot of you would do better to learn the golden rule of \"loving your neighbor as yourself.\"  Not just secular laws. If they loved me as themselves they would park in their space I would in mine , that's fair and loving each other as ourselves. Seeing other AITA posts like \"AITA for giving up my first class seat on a plane to stop a baby from crying\", and you guys label him as an asshole , shows me reddit has ungodly judgment and I will never post here again . Thank you to the few who say NTA as you understand loving your neighbor as yourself and the rest of you would do better to practice it. Truth in love. Thanks. God bless.Edit 2 : I just want reserved parking in front of my house. I don't think that's too much to ask if everyone has one . If you people did not know there Is only 5 houses on my block with my house being the last to the east. A field to my right (east), neighbor #1 (out of 3 others) to my left, forest behind us , a barely two lane street in front , and a field in front of said street. Us 5 houses should have reserved parking for the residents. It's not that much to ask and is a luxury we all can afford. Thanks for the time and have a great day  .Edit 3: I welcomed him to the neigborhood and we shook hands. He said he should not have been so angry,  and I sympathized with him explaining I didn't want to go about that way right after he got home. I told him about jesus he is not religious , grew up methodist- but says we can talk another time as it was about 10 pm we were looking for our cat. Thanks guys have a blessed one.",

	"body" : "I (19M) have a sister (16F) and we both live with our parents (late 40's M and F).Me and my dad have always cared very well about our health. My dad pushed us to exercise regularly, and I do so with him and we always have a good time, and feel pumped afterwards. He also pushed us to have healthy diets, take vitamins, etc. Not in a bad way, but he always tried to lead me and my sister in the right direction, and it worked on me since I follow very healthy habits.My sister, however, has never listened to our dad regarding any of this. She would always brush him and I off, saying she's fine, and at times she'd even blow up screaming at us, calling me the \"favorite child\" and our parents \"emotionally abusive\". Our dad indeed tried to push my sister a little more to get into a healthy lifestyle, but that was because my sister had dangerously high cholesteral due to genetics (inherited from our mom) so of course he would be much more concerned about her health than mine. So I would actually argue that she would've gotten more attention than me, since our dad was so worried about her.Anyway, onto the main event. Recently, my sister fell of a small cliff (around 30-40 ft in height) and fractured both of her legs, but her right leg was the most damaged. Her right leg had an open fracture, meaning her broken bone actually broke skin, and because it took a bit for the ambulence to get there, my sister's leg got infected very badly, and they had to cut off the 1/4 of the bottom of the leg so that the infection couldn't spread anywhere else.Although she has been upset (understandably) but the things she was saying to us and her friends were rubbing me the wrong way. She was saying how she could never walk hikes, would never be able to go on runs, etc. Which normally I'd say is normal but she literally never has done any of that stuff. She hates hiking, she hates going on walks, she literally sits all day in her room on her computer and hardly comes out (even before part of her leg being amputated). I tried to ignore this, but she kept saying these things, and now including sports, something she has always hated.I got angry one day and told her to stop using her leg for attention seeking and sympathy, because she never wanted to exercise and be healthy so there is no way that she wanted that now, and that she could process what's happening to her without lying to us and herself.She. Lost. It. She grabbed stuff and threw it around her room and yelled at me until I left. And when I told what happened to our dad (who normally agrees with me) he looked absolutely horrified as did my mom and they screamed at me. They said that what I said was way out of line, and it wasn't the \"right time\". And now they aren't speaking to me at all.I think I was being honest when she needed to hear it, though now I am doubting myself. AITA?",

So he regularly brings women over to just hang out or to have sex with.This makes me uncomfortable for a few reasons, I don’t like it when random people just show up in the space where I live unannounced and unknown. I mean they’re going home with some random guy to potentially sleep with them, they probably aren’t great.The second being is that my room has incredibly thin walls. I typically stay up till around 3 and if he brings a girl over at 1 I’m going to have to hear their gross noises while I’m trying to game or watch TV or read. It’s not pleasant, I would prefer to know so I could not be there if she comes over.Lastly, I don’t want to see them or evidence of them in the morning. I go to the gym every morning at 9AM, and that around the time they come out of his room to stumble back to her place. I just don’t want to see them because we both know what happened and it just feels so awkward.So I finals ended yesterday and roommate went out and brought home another slutty girl and they had the loudest sex I’ve ever heard. That morning I saw her and him when I got up and got ready for the gym and she apologized and said she didn’t know I [his roommate] was home.

I said that I thought it was annoying and I don’t like constantly having random girls over, them interrupting the only quiet time I have to myself at night and then see them in the morning.My roommate told me that I was being a dick because I’m jealous of him and that my attitude isn’t going to help me get laid.

	"body" : "I(23) have 3 siblings - 20f, 26f, 28mMy parents were always working, so my brother was always there for us. He was the one that babysat us every day; he made sure we went to school and extracurriculars safely and back. He was the one who got on parents' backs about paying for extracurriculars. My younger sister is autistic; she had a food sensitivity, and my brother was the only one able to make her food or have the patience to make it the way she wanted. So when my brother left for college, which was a state away, we lost our structure. My parents and I were always arguing, and my sister started having more breakdowns because my parents didn’t understand how she liked her food or her routine, plus at the time she was sleeping with my brother most nights because she didn’t like sleeping by herself and nobody like sleeping with her because she snored, and she was pretty particular about stuff like if she brushed before bathing or if she ate after her nightly brush. At the time she was like 7 and I was 13, and only my brother could really get her like that, so everyone in my family was having trouble catering to her because we didn’t realise how much effort my brother put into helping her not have breakdowns. So we went from a peaceful house to constant fighting. My mom stopped paying for our extracurriculars because no one could take me; no one was here to play mediator, and when my brother called, he rarely spent more than 5 minutes on the phone and rarely came home. I got depressed quickly and turned to substances when I was 17.My parents and siblings put me in rehab a couple times, and I am now 23 and about 2 years sober. My siblings and I recently had dinner to celebrate my 2-year recovery (my sister's idea). My brother and I aren’t as close as he is to my other siblings, and I think a large part of that is due to drug abuse in the past. So we were talking, and I was just thanking everyone for being a support system to me, and my sister, who is autistic, asked if she was the reason why I started substances because of her breakdowns. And I said that she wasn't; it was just really hard for me when our brother left. My brother looked a bit uncomfortable but didn’t say anything. We continued our dinner, and my other sister asked what was wrong with my brother. He said he felt sick and left early. I called him when I got home and asked him what was up; he said nothing but that he wasn’t feeling well. My older sister and I were talking a few days later, and I just said how I was confused on why he left, and she said he said I made him feel uncomfortable during the dinner and that he feels like I was trying to make him feel bad for living his life, and that I blamed him but didn’t mention our parents. That was not what I meant, and I feel horrible that he chose to interpret it that way. But I also feel kind of sad that he chose to tell my sister instead of just telling me he was uncomfortable and clarifying the issue. Aita. Was I wrong to have said what I said?",

	"title" : "AITA For Telling On My Roommates for Smoking Weed?",
	"body" : "I (23F) am in my senior year of college. I have a lot of mental health issues (generalized anxiety, major depression, and PTSD) and physical health issues, which has led me to getting an emotional support cat and housing accommodations. Before school started I reached out to my three roommates and informed them of my situation. The first roommate (Laura, 21F) was fine with it. The second roommate (Rita,19) was a little hesitant, but willing to make it work. The third roommate (Nellie,19) objected and said that she had a friend that was more than willing to switch with me. She ignored all of my further messages and went straight to the housing office and tried to get me kicked out ( the office contacted me and told me). Rita and Nellie are friends, so the more I spoke to Rita the more she assured me that Nellie didn’t actually have any issues, she just doesn’t particularly like cats. Once school started everything was okay for about a week, but then I got a text from them telling me that my cat kept getting on the counters. I apologized and told them that I would do whatever I could to prevent her from getting on the counters. After that I proceeded to keep my cat in my room for 90% of the day, but she gets antsy so at night I would let her out. I also put aluminum foil on the counter to deter her from getting on them and disinfected every morning. My issues with them are their friends. Due to my PTSD I have some issues with men and ALL of their friends are really big burly men. Their friends were constantly over and my mental health was deteriorating fast, so I asked them if they could tell me when their friends were coming over so that I can either mentally prepare or leave, they agreed. The next day, they continued to have people over without telling me. About a week had passed and I grew increasingly upset, so I ended up sending them a very antagonistic text message (which I regret). Of course, it ended in a long fight that ended with me contacting our RA. We ended up having a meeting with the RA where they agreed to inform me of guests and I agreed to stay downstairs with my cat (they apparently still had issues with my cat). You’d think that would be the end of it, but no, now they tell me about guests maybe 30% of the time. Now put that with the fact that they NEVER clean and leave huge messes, leave huge chunks of hair everywhere(i've even found some in the freezer), scream at the top of their lungs to get the attention of each other(not an exaggeration), and the incessant weed smoking. I don’t normally have issues with smoking, but they do it so often and it is so potent that it makes me feel sick. I am at my wits end and I feel like I can’t talk to them about it since they don’t respect the one issue that I did speak to them about. I feel like going to my RA was the best thing for me, but I am feeling a little guilty about it since they can get in trouble for the weed. AITA?Edit: I can't move because I was given housing accommodations and this dorm was chosen specifically because it best fits my needs for my physical disabilities. Our school has a lot of disabled students so yes, the other dorms with accommodations are full.Edit: It turns out that Nellie objected because #1 she wanted their friend to move in with them and #2 Rita was supposed to bring her non-ESA approved dog with her and since I was bringing my cat she could not. I saw a lot of comments saying that I was forcing my roommates to live with a cat so I wouldn't like to clarify that #1 they were told about the cat months in advance so that they could find other housing if they so choose and #2 they weren't going to tell me about their dog until after we moved in! The only reason they told me was because it conflicted with me bringing my cat.Update: First, I would like to thank those who gave me actual constructive criticism and to those who supported me. So it turns out that at my school I have to call at the exact moment they are smoking weed in order for them to get in trouble. That being said, I decided not to say anything. I know that telling on them would take it to far, so I just decided to endure it. I did speak to my RA and RD about the issues they already knew we were having and they informed me that my two roommates are actually looking to be placed somewhere else next semester. I feel bad that they have to pack up all of their things and move, but I feel like it is what is best for everyone. Nobody was getting along and staying under the same roof would have made everyone miserable.update 2: I was just informed that they are no longer moving and went downstairs to them eating my food. cheers to a terrible four more months!",

She is also planning on getting a tattoo with her friends older sister in her memory.Because she wears these things, people ask where they came from and she explains about her friend.

She said she didn’t understand why I felt the need to correct her, and I pointed out that she wasn’t using proper grammar, and that she often doesn’t while talking about her friend.

I pointed out that she’s talking about her late friend, so the conversation is already awkward and sad.

	"body" : "So my girlfriend and I are both students at a rather large university in my area. We've been together for almost three years now, and although she has been on a few voice calls with me, my girlfriend hadn't met my parents in person before, since they live quite far away. Recently they flew in to visit me, and my girlfriend and I were both looking forward to the occasion.Now something worth noting about my girlfriend in that context is that she's kind of a hippie at heart. She has an alternative (though nice) style of dress, and come the summer months, she will often just ditch shoes and go barefoot all day. Honestly I personally don't mind, I find it kind of charming actually, but when my parents came to visit, I reminded her that my parents can be quite conservative and to think of that when she decides what to wear, and to dress up a little.We had different schedules that day so the next time I see her was in front of the restaurant where we would meet my parents. I was doing small talk with them when she arrived, and she was wearing a nice sundress, but no shoes. There wasn't any table available outside so we had to go inside, and afterwards, as planned, we showed my parents the  town, with my girlfriend just padding along in her bare feet.My parents were too polite to make a comment right then, but when they got home, they apparently made comments to my sister and other relatives about my \"grungy girlfriend\".I admit I blew up at my girlfriend afterwards. (I already apologised for my choice of words) I told her to dress appropriately for my conservative parents, and she just shows up to the restaurant barefoot. She says she just did not think about it when she left her apartment without shoes and also I am the AH for trying to control how she dresses. She says the visit went well and she thinks she and my parents got along well, but I just don't want to be \"grungy\" to be the first association my parents have with my long-term girlfriend.AITA for expecting her to know what's appropriate?Edit: since it has come up a couple of times in the comments, going barefoot is not the norm where I live. We're not exactly in a beachside town. Still, my girlfriend is far from the only one, and most of the population are students at the university anyways, so in essence, nobody in town really cares, which includes the restaurants. This is not in the US.Edit2: Okay, I read all comments, and I accept my judgement. I must admit, some of them hit close to home. I already apologised again to my girlfriend, for my outburst and for not standing up to my parents for her. I love her just how she is, and I overreacted because I really want this to work. I showed her this thread and we're both amused how the top comment is about how unrealistic it is for somebody to walk barefoot in a city (it's really more a town than a city, but still) ;)",

The one thing that is relevant with the post that is considered by doctors to be a \"OCD Tendency\" is clean clothes. I refuse to wear anything more than once (even a sweat shirt or jacket) without washing it and I outright refuse to wear anything once it's touched the floor. I personally don't even think it's due to OCD, because once clothes have touched the floor a lot of people won't wear them so I know a lot of people who feel the same way I do. BUT my fiancé and his daughter are the opposite.They do this thing where instead of unloading the dryer, folding the clothes and putting them away, they will pull all of the clothes out of the dryer and onto the floor, dig through it to find what they want and then stick the clothes back in the dryer after they've been tainted by the bathroom floor. They also do this if I've moved the clean clothes to a basket and put it in like the living room or something. They will dig through it and put the clothes all over the floor and only sometimes will they put the clothes back in the basket. They know I refuse to wear anything that's touched the floor and they continue to do it because they insist I'm being overdramatic. This has led to me continuously rewashing clothing and my fiancé is in charge of the electric bill so he foots that high energy cost. I've told him multiple times that he and his daughter needs to stop putting the clothes on the floor and then the energy from the washer/dryer wouldn't be running up the bill but they continue to do it.So this morning I'm getting ready for work in the bathroom and my fiancé comes in with the electric bill and he's bitching because it's $80 more than usual and saying we need to stop running so much stuff because the bill is getting ridiculous. Immediately following this he opens the dryer and pulls out at least half of the clothes looking for his flannel and they fell out on the floor and he just threw them back in the dryer and walked out. So I took all the clothes and put them in the washer to rewash them. As soon as he hears the washer going he comes back in and asks what I'm washing because I had already done all the laundry so I explained to him that I'm rewashing the clothes that he just dumped on the nasty floor. He starts bitching immediately because he just got done saying we needed to cut back in energy cost, so I told him I would continue to run up the bill providing him and his daughter continued to dump the clothes on the floor.

However, as the costs started adding up, I realized that throwing such a luxurious party was going to be quite expensive. That's when I had an idea—I could charge my friends admission to attend the party and offset some of the costs. I thought it was a win/win situation: they get to come to a fabulous party, and I get some financial help. So, I sent out invitations to my friends and noted that there would be a small admission fee to cover the expenses. I made it clear that it was non-negotiable and essential for the party to happen. I thought my friends would understand and gladly contribute since they would be attending an incredible event.To my surprise, the reactions were not what I expected. Some of my friends called me out, saying it was inconsiderate and rude to charge admission to my own birthday party. They accused me of being money-minded and using them for my own gain. They argued that a birthday party should be a gift from me to them, not the other way around. I was very surprised by their responses. I never thought they would react this way. I genuinely believed that charging admission was a fair approach considering the extravagant nature of the party. After all, I was the one organizing and financing everything.Now, my friends are left divided, with some supporting my decision and others calling me out for being \"selfish.\" I'm left feeling confused and wondering if I am in the wrong in this situation.

She got home when I was sleeping, put a pizza square on my desk, didn't wake me or anything, and just went to bed.When I woke up the pizza was all gross and dry.So I asked her could she fix something else for dinner. She refused, she said she'd got take away, like I had, and it wasn't her problem I wasn't awake you eat it.I told her that I got takeaway as a last resort because I didn't want her to be hungry after she'd refused everything I offered to make for her and I made sure she was awake when we got it.She still refused to make dinner so I told her she was lazy and being a bad girlfriend because I cared enough about her to make sure she ate when it was my turn to make dinner but she couldn't be bothered to extend be the same courtesy.",

	"title" : "AITA for bailing on being a groomsmen for a friend's wedding on the morning of the wedding?",
	"body" : "Yeah reading the title, it's a no-brainer. Here's what happened.My friend had a wedding in Bali and made it a major event. There were 4 or 6 groomsmen. He even had matching suits tailored for everyone, and there was something planned with us lifting him. I can't remember. He had rented a major venue and i believe 200 people were in attendance.I cancelled either the evening before or the morning of the wedding. Meaning, not only did I miss it, but they had to find a replacement for the thing he had prepared.Two weeks prior, I'd had a near death experience. It's pointless to describe with words, but here are some facts. For the following two weeks, i slept max 4 hours per night. I spent at least 4 hours per day meditating. My entire being was filled with love and joy. The past and future did not exist. Golden light streamed into me from above and filled every cell of my body. I always knew exactly what to do. Where to go, who to meet, what to eat. The extent of intuitively knowing what to do was pure magic. I only used my mind, thoughts, when served a specific purpose. In this period, i learned a lot about myself and was incredibly productive.Then, the wedding. Fatigue started catching up with me, but to be honest, physically i would have been able to manage. There was something else.I absolutely could not imagine being at a wedding, talking to 'normal' people, in the state i was in. And my intuition told me to not go, so i didn't. With intuition i mean a vibration expanding from the core, functioning like a compass for action. Do or not do.I apologized to my friend later. He never responded, which is the appropriate reaction of course. His brother, one of my closest friends at the time, reached out and we had a long talk, but yeah that's irrelevant here.Imagine being in a state of no attachment. Not as a theoretical concept, or something that can be rationally understood. There just really isn't any attachment to the past or to future outcomes. It's just not part of your being.I was in a state of permanent joy and had zero remorse. It just is/was. Actions have consequences. I lost two good friends. If i could go back in time, I'd probably do the same.So. AITA here? I'm curious what people make of this.One note, no substances were involved in my experience, just an nde brought on by not breathing for the perfect amount of time.[EDIT FOR CLARITY, CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS: 1. Nearly suffocated, soul left the body and returned. 2. Two weeks intense period, described above. 3. Not showing up to wedding. 4. Apologizing to groom.]",

There are plans for her to meet our extended family soon. She's seems nice and like a good match for my brother.I did notice she has strong 11s on her forehead. (11s are lines you get on your forehead between your eyes when you squint or furrow your eyebrows). When her and I were talking I mentioned that I've been getting preventive botox for six years now and she could also benefit from it to remove her 11s. I just mentioned my experience. I thought it was fine because she didn't say anything but she complained to my brother after they left about it and he ripped into me. He said I offended her even though that wasn't my intention and I was just sharing my experience. I've been getting it for six years, since I finished grad school and started working. Most of the women in my friend group or at work get it done. There's no shame in it and getting preventive botox will help look younger in the long run. I would probably have prominent 11s if I didn't. My father and both of my brothers have them and so does my brother-in-law actually. My mom escaped them for some lucky reason. But his girlfriend has them and botox is a solution.It wasn't my intention to offend her. My brother is mad I said anything. He said she's offended and hurt. He said it's none of my business. I honestly didn't intend to upset her. I was just sharing my experience and I didn't think she'd get so upset since it's common among the women I know. It's not taboo or shameful.

Now, on to the story.So, my cousin got married a bit over a year ago. For the first dance, the band played a song that has a title (for the sake of simplicity, we'll call the song \"Zoe\") that rhymes with my cousin's name (who we'll call Chloe), so they used her name in place of the song's actual title. I don't want to say the actual names, since I can't think of any other names that rhyme with the two, and I don't want anyone figuring out who this is about on the off-chance someone else here was at that wedding.Anyway, as soon as the band said they were replacing \"Zoe\" with \"Chloe\", I had to put on my poker face because I knew the song was about something...kinda bad. In short, it's about alcoholism and committing crime. To the casual listener, it's hard to notice due to the upbeat nature of the song, it's when you actually look at the lyrics you realise what it's about. (I will not be confirming or denying if anyone figures out the song, so don't ask).Anyway, I didn't say anything at the wedding, because I know damn well what a bad idea it is to ruin a bride's big day. I'm just not sure if it would make me an AH to ever mention it, potentially ruining the memory of Chloe's wedding.So Reddit, WIBTA?",

Thus getting even fatter.I get off work at 7pm and I let my cat outside to do his business because he prefers not to use the litter box.

They do have young kids so I feel bad for possibly waking them up with my yelling, but like don’t steal my cat?I just rescued a street kitten and I nursed him back to health. Soon he will be allowed back outside with my other adopted cat. It is very kind that they care about my cats and worry about them getting cold, but I want my cats to come to my door when they need something!

	"body" : "My (27f) sister (31f) started pulling away from our family when she moved away 5 years ago.We talked recently, she told me she was doing really well and even invited me to visit so me and our other sister made a trip up there.Well, our brief phone call didn’t prepare me for how different she was. She was always on the larger side and had slimmed down to the point where she was still a bit curvy but not like she was. When I mentioned this, she got really quiet and evasive.She also had a handful of tattoos which was odd because as a kid she had always hated tattoos. Funny enough, her bf (34m) is a tattoo artist who owns a studio and is way (and I mean WAY) out of her league which concerned me a bit.The other very strange thing was that she fosters rats. She wouldn’t be caught holding a rodent as a kid and now she’s taking care of 4 of them. When I asked her why, she said that she had a roughfew years and bf encouraged her to find a new hobby.When I asked her for an Ibuprofen, she seemed a bit embarrassed and went to her bf who went into the kitchen and got some out of a safe. When I asked him way he kept OTC medication in a safe, he said, “all medications go in the safe.” Later, when we were leaving to our hotel for the night, she went up to her bf and asked for some migraine medication which he also kept in the safe which tells me she doesn’t know the code for the safe.When we went out for dinner, she’d always have her food to go and never ate in front of anyone. Her bf would offer her some fries or his side salad but she always refused.I tried to get things back to normal with some light teasing like saying that with how little she eats, your think she’d be stick thin or with the whole safe things, I kinda half jokingly said “everything ok with your relationship?” or when she was showing us her rats, I said to her boyfriend “are you sure you want more rats since you already have one in your life?” She always got really defensive.Towards the end of our visit, her bf pulled me aside and said that the last thing she needs is for us to come in and destroy her progress so if we were going to come back into her life, we needed to be supportive of her. He said there needs to be no more comments about her appearance, eating habits, hobbies, and safety measures like the safe. I told him that he seemed controlling and he got all holier than thou saying that he was there for her when we weren’t and that he only does what her doctors recommend to keep her safe. He wouldn’t give me any other information beyond that.When it came time to leave, I told my sister I refused to see her again if her bf was present and advised her to break up with him because he seems like a control freak. She started crying and told me to stay out of their relationship and that I didn’t know anything because I hadn’t talked to her the last 5 years. Later she texted me asking me for an apology.Aita here?",

	"body" : "Background- So I (28F) live 2 hrs away from my family with my bf and service dog.I have acquired a psychiatric service dog in my time away from home. She is almost 2 years old and was trained with me and a (service dog) professional. It’s better to do that with psychiatric dogs so they learn you better.My family only met her when she was in early stages of training or before hand, except for one instance, some of them met me for lunch, and I had her with me.They don’t allow her in their house or really for me to bring her down if I am to see them at all. They don’t think she is a service dog because she hasn’t taken her final test and isn’t registered. I remind them that there is no real registry and that her final test is more like a graduation from the program thing not what makes her a service dog as there are many people who don’t go through programs like this And still have valid service dogs. They call her an emotional support dog, or a very nice dog or a good dog, but refused to acknowledge anything else.The last couple of months she has been by my side when I go everywhere except for work (not allowed). I brought her into other peoples homes with various types of animals at varying ages, and she is good with all of them and if she knows she’s working, she stays with me anyway.The Issue- Next Sunday, I agreed to help my family with a fundraiser for their charity at a local theater. I’m used to helping them with big events, and I grew up in a theater, nothing is new here. We just talked to see if I would come down the night before or drive right up, and I told them, I would have my dog and it became a big fight. They keep saying they can’t handle her being there and they wish they could have their dog there but they can’t because this is an important event. I again remind them saying they have a cute puppy, not a service dog and to respect me and my dog and the training we have gone through to make us a team they just repeat themselves in various ways, and we had to cut the call short. I’m so tired of them not listening to me, I love them so much and I agreed to help because it’s a good cause and I know the Performer.But if she can’t come, I want to tell them I won’t come. If she can’t come to Thanksgiving or Christmas (if I’m off). I want to tell them I won’t be there either. I might be moving in April and will be a few states away and not see them for I don’t know how long I want to spend these holidays with them and I want to help like I said I would but I need my dog there with me and they just don’t seem to care.Would I be the asshole/ make a big mistake if I cancel everything until they let me bring her?CLARIFY- yes she is a service dog not ESA. I didn’t think I needed to put what she was for exactly but the most basic is, I have autism and she helps me with pressure therapy, stimming, and stopping harmful behaviorsUPDATE- I spoke with her on the phone. She said I could come as a guest and bring the dog but now I’m putting her in a stressful situation to fill my spot.",

	"body" : "I work with predominantly female-presenting people, however recently we've hired someone who uses they/them pronouns (I'll call them Ellis). On Ellis' first day, very few of the other staff were informed of their pronouns, so there was a lot of misgendering happening. I made an effort to correct any instance I heard as politely and privately as possible, as I didn't want to make Ellis uncomfortable or feel othered.As the next couple weeks passed, I continued to actively correct any incorrect pronoun use in the same way; let the person finish speaking, and politely remind them 'they, not she'. Most people seem to be pretty able to self correct if they slip up, but a small handful have had to be corrected multiple times, sometimes more than once in the same conversation.My final straw was coming in to see a note from one coworker (I'll call her Becky) that used both 'they' and 'she' to refer to Ellis. I had corrected Becky several times already, and so when she came to me and verbally referred to Ellis as 'she' I finally snapped at her. I told her that she had to start using the right pronouns, and expressed my frustration with how often I've had to correct her and multiple other people. I don't believe I was shouting, but I do know I got heated and may have raised my voice a bit (I talk very loudly normally, so my concept of my own volume isn't great). Becky became defensive and claimed that she was trying, and that she didn't understand why this particular situation was challenging for her. I calmed down and clarified that I wasn't just frustrated with her, and gave some examples as to why it may be that she was finding this situation so challenging, as opposed to other instances where coworkers have had different pronouns and she had no issue remembering them.I thought the conversation ended fine, until the next day I made a similar correction to my boss (she and I have a close working relationship, but I made my comment to her much more calmly, though she could clearly tell I was frustrated) which resulted in me being told that Becky felt attacked by how I called her out the previous day. Later, when I spoke to Becky I apologized for my behavior, and she gave a dismissive 'I forgive you'.I know I shouldn't have lost my cool, but it was beginning to feel like I was the only person holding people accountable in the workplace. I should add, the company I work for tries to be very progressive and we receive hours of anti-descrimination and inclusivity training, so there really isn't any gray area around how we should treat people. Becky is from a very small, very conservative town, but has never really had issues with this in the past, as previously mentioned.So, AITA for calling my coworker out for repeatedly not respecting someone's pronouns?Edit: I am a supervisor, actually.

They just had their first child last summer and generally lives a very comfortable life. My middle one had a full college experience, got her degree in Gender Studies and took part in a lot of volunteer work and political causes. She is a middle school teacher and struggles just like anyone on a teachers salary.

She even had an argument with the eldest last Christmas when she mocked her of showing off her wealth by buying everyone expensive gifts. In her defense, she had a few too many, and later did apologized to her. The problem is that all of this has rubbed off to our youngest. Despite being an academically gifted and smart girl, she has decided to not go to college. She claims that she is not ambitious and she does not want to work.

Additionally the youngest also sees how miserable the middle one is and despite being a smart person and going to college, she has problem paying bills.

But this morning two of my friends started saying that I should’ve picked out a different movie instead of making one person miss out on the group activity. I don’t think this is fair because leaving was what she suggested for herself, I didn’t kick her out or anything.tl;dr: I chose a movie for everyone to watch that triggered a girl and then didn’t pick a different movie when that made her go home, ATIA?",

	"body" : "I would like to warn you, English is not my native language.I, (Female) have a daughter (12) who has been obsessed with chess since last December.About a month ago, they didn't have enough girls too play for the district meeting, so despite my daughter being a new addition, the chess club invited her too play along with a friend, and surprisingly, she had won first place. (4 wins 1 draw.)Yesterday was the city meet, where they took the best players from the last tournament too play in it. My daughter ended up with 3 wins, 4 losses. In one of her other games, she had resigned, which her coach has told her multiple times not too.When we hit home, I told everyone the story and they all asked her \"Why did you resign?\" and after I asked aswell she got sick of the question and yelled at everyone, \"Because I was losing! You all know nothing about chess and I'm sick of you all answering teh questions despite me answering it multiple times in your plain earshot!\"Too which her cousin responded, \"Your own coach told you not too.\"My daughter got madder and said, \"Even grandmasters would have resigned at that point!\" Too which her uncle agreed too.Her cousin told her she was being rude to which most aunts agreed. She then said, \"You all know nothing about chess and your speaking as if your Grandmasters who saw the game when none of you did!\"This didn't suprise me, as she's snappy and short tempered with family members but of course I grounded her anyway. Her uncle then later came up too me and said my daughter was right, as there really was no possible way too salvage the position. (I'm not sure as I don't play)So now I'm wondering if I am in the wrong.Edit: Forgot a minor detail she also added, \"Even the arbiter agreed it was lost.\"",

She had ended up with 1st place. 2 days ago, Harriet showed me a chess submission forum her teacher had sent her in a mall we usually go to. The entrance fee is around 10-20 dollars, so I agreed.Earlier this morning, I saw Harriet's hair was a mess, with dandruff everywhere. Now, Harriet is Awful at cleaning her hair, and usually has some sort of stupid excuse. (Eg. \"You never taught me how!\")So I told her, \"Harriet, you're getting a haircut.\" She wasn't at all happy about this and told me she wouldn't, especially after I said I wanted her too get a Boy-short haircut. I got mad, as Harriet told me she would under no circumstances cut her hair. I got even more pissed because, well, why have semi long hair if you can't even take care of it properly?So I told her, \"If you won't get your haircut, I won't let you participate in the tournament.\"She glared at me and said, \"You do this every time to get your way!\"So I did what I my eyes was reasonable and grounded her. Earlier this afternoon however, her Father told me and said I was being unreasonable. (We are divorced.)

	"body" : "I (54M) have two daughters (16F and 14F). My daughters normally do chores around the house, nothing much, just unloading the dishwasher, making their own dinners, walking the dog and hoovering. Today was a pretty tough day at work, I'm a delivery driver and had lots of complaints and drove quite a long distance, so when i got home i was tired as you could probably imagine. I began making dinner as soon as i got home and noticed some dirty dishes in the sink and some crumbs on the counter. I yelled at my girls to come downstairs and complained about the mess. As they put the plates away and wiped the side i began making my lunch for work tomorrow. We had a conversation after that and shortly after i went to have a shower. When i got out of the shower, i walked into the kitchen and everything i used to make my lunch was still on the kitchen counter. I yelled at my kids to come downstairs and yelled at them for not putting the stuff away. My eldest apologised and my youngest argued back that she didnt know i was done with them and didnt want to get in the way, both of them said they didnt know they were meant to put the stuff on the side into the dishwashes although i thought it was pretty obvious since i asked them to do the other stuff in the kitchen. I yelled at them and the youngest ran back upstairs crying, saying she had had a stressful day at school and didn't have the energy for this. The eldest just apologised again and i told her to go upstairs. They usually do all the chores their asked to do so i don't know why this one is any different. When my wife came home i told her about it, she didn't say much, she just gave me this dissapointed look. Im starting to wonder if maybe i wasnt clear enough. Am i the asshole?EDIT: I thought i would clarify, the dirty plates in the sink and crumbs on the counter were due to my youngest daughter cooking herself dinner. Typically she will make her dinner, put the dishes in the sink, wipe the sides then clean the dishes once shes finished her dinner so she can clean her dinner plate along with the other stuff. However i dont know why the crumbs were left there, making me irritated as it seemed like she didnt even TRY to clean up like she usually does. I dont usually yell at my kids because they usually do their chores as expected, it was just today when they didnt for some reason.EDIT 2: Another thing i thought i would clarify is that the kids don't do all the housework, its mainly their mother and the point of the chores is to help out a bit. My youngest daughter found a passion for cooking and my eldest followed, meaning gradually overtime they began cooking their own dinners and it became part of their chores. I love cooking so my daughters know if they ever want me to make them dinner they can simply ask. Making dinner isnt a mandatory chore for them, they choose to do it. The mandatory chores are walking the dog if they have time, doing the dishwasher/cleaning the dirty dishes and occasionally hoovering, which i think is fair.EDIT 3: my eldest daughter doesnt go to school. She finished her exams so she finished school early. She does work experience at an office from 8 to 12 every weekday. She gets paid to file papers and talk to people, i wouldnt say thats particularly stressful or tiring. School isnt exactly tiring either especially if you have no upcoming exams like my youngest so there is no excuse for them being busy.UPDATE/FINAL EDIT: I came home from work early. My youngest daughter was in the kitchen and went up stairs to her room as soon as she saw me. I spoke with my wife and she told me my youngest said she was terrified when i yelled at her last night. My wife told me my eldest got her hair cut and bleached today as well as getting her ears pierced, something shes wanted to do for a while. I called for her to come downstairs and show me but she didnt respond. I tried talking to them but neither of them are interested in speaking to me. I feel guilty but to a certain extent i still feel as if i was justified.",

While our breakup was not amicable, we haven’t had many problems coparenting before.B has been with his fiancé M (26) for about 2 years. He proposed to her around the same time they announced her pregnancy. M has been really good for B, from what I have seen the two have a pretty healthy relationship and she does well with our daughter. I actually really like M and we get along.Two days ago, their son was born unexpectedly while M was only about 8 months pregnant. I can’t imagine what they are going through.B called me today and asked if I could watch our daughter for his week because with the baby in the NICU right now he and M are struggling to manage, and that he doesn’t want our daughter to see him, M, and the baby in their current state.I thought about it and eventually told him that I can’t do the extra week because I have a travel thing for work that I can’t miss (I could reschedule but it would piss my boss off), in addition I said that it would not be fair of him to push our daughter to the side to favor his new family.He begged me, saying that it wasn't like that and that he would make any compromise needed for me to take the extra week. I stood by what I said and suggested ways for him to make it work. He said that he wishes that I wouldn’t be such a bitch and work with him for once, before he hung up.While I understand that B is going through a hard time right now, I do feel strongly that it is important that he maintains his relationship with our daughter, even when it is tough. Especially now, while the new baby is still in the hospital and being watched by nurses and doctors 24/7, I’m sure that he will be able to find a way to make it work... I can’t imagine that it will be much easier once the baby is home.Anyways, I’m not doing this out of any resentment for B or M, as I love and care for them both. I just don’t want my daughter to suffer because of something that has nothing to do with her.edited for transparency - i miscalculated how long M was pregnant, she was at 32 weeks when she delivered, so technically she was 8 months pregnant, not 7.5, not that I think it will change many opinions.",

So I have tons of food aversions. I can't eat spicy or starchy food ect.We usually take turns making dinner. But I noticed that they are still makinh unhealthy, spicy, starchy foods. I told them about my condition. To be fair, they didn't know I was a diabetic since I never mentioned it. I'm also not on meds for it, but I am medicated for my autism, depression and anxiety.We tried eating more healthy but a few weeks in they were back to their old cooking habits. I bought our diet up and Amber said that she always let me know beforehand what she makes, so that I can buy something additionally or make my own food if I don't want to have her food. She does, but since we all contribute to the groceries this just doesn't seem fair.Jessica also said they can't eat my food because the fiber content is too high and it messes with their GI tract. In short, they wanted to keep with saying what they're planning to make for dinner ahead of time so that I can make a plan if I'm not feeling it. Jessica suggested splitting groceries between myself, amber and her but I feel like that's just making the decision worse.I also feel that this is unfair because we used to be really close at uni. We did most things together. I noticed that whenever I get home (I usually get home later than Jessica and Amber), they just stay in their rooms and don't socialize much. They act like strangers and it's making me feel unwelcome and snubbed.They countered by saying that they're both introverts and just like doing their own thing. Amber games and Jessica gardens.I tried involving myself a bit with Amber's gaming and asked if I could watch her play. She bluntly told me that if she wants to socialize, she'll come get me. But that she wants to be left alone at home to recharge.Jessica likes gardening so I tried involving myself there. I have a boyfriend who's really good at irrigation and wanted to ask him to help set up an irrigation system for Jessica. She lost it on me and told me it's her garden, not my boyfriends. And that he can set up an irrigation system for my patch of garden, but she loves manually watering her plants.I'm just feeling excluded and snubbed, and coming home is causing some major anxiety. Which is making me wonder if I did something wrong? So I told them that I'm feeling snubbed and ignored, and they told me that we don't have to do everything together and that I'm being too pushy. Now they're completely ignoring me. Its worse than before. This isn't at all what I imagined living with my friends was like. It's causing me major anxiety.Aita?",

We both got recruited to a local university to play at a d1 level and it’s always been our dream to play at a higher level.Everything was going to plan until my older brother (whom we’ll call “Jake”) got injured during off-season drills. He completely tore his Achilles and received a minor MCL injury. He was already playing at the collegiate level, but he never really recovered from the injury and eventually dropped out.Since then, I’ve enrolled in the same university and his life has sorta fallen apart. He’s gained significant weight and his girlfriend of 6 years recently dumped him for being overly lazy.One night, about 2 months ago, Jake and I were hanging out and playing COD at his place. We got to talking and eventually he started confiding in me about his recent mental health struggles and how he’d been coping with the breakup.For context, I’m not very good at biting my tongue and I tend to be overly blunt. So when he started listing off the countless reasons for his mental decline, which included the weight gain and breakup, I made a remark about his injury.I said something along the lines of “If you just didn’t get injured, everything wouldn’t have gone to shit.”He didn’t take that very well and asked that I leave. I tried to defend myself but he was very persistent that I leave.We haven’t talked since and he’s obviously holding it against me. I obviously could’ve worded it different, but I stand by what I said and I think he’s slightly overreacting because it’s simply the truth.I want what’s best for him, and I want us to be able to talk again, but he’s old enough to not get all worked up in my opinion. I also feel he’s been holding my success against me because he was never able to live out our dream and, so far, I have.So, Reddit, Am I the Asshole?**Update: Thanks for all the advice and being upfront with me. Me and Jake are back on speaking terms and everything seems to be fine now. It actually ironic because all it took was me getting an injury in camp (quite minor of an injury) for him to poke fun at me and for us to talk again. All is well.",

I was ecstatic for her she even told me the news before she told her husband. I had a lot of stressful things happen in my life in addition to the fertility stuff like a layoff and health scare. She was as supportive as she could be but it wasn’t the same as before. She even had to cancel coming to a very important event that I held because of her pregnancy. I understand why she couldn’t come but it sucked she wasn’t there. Before her son was born I offered to visit anytime she needed me so I could help with her or the baby or any other things she may need, but I felt like the offer was pushed off because anytime I mentioned it, she would say something like “I’ll have to see how (husband) and I are feeling”Beth gave birth a few weeks ago and I was shocked at how little I seemed to matter to her immediately. I thought that if I wasn’t there to meet him in person, we’d FaceTime soon afterwards but I seemed to fall to the bottom of the pile. She went from telling me everything to not introducing me to her baby for almost a day after he was born. (She sent me pictures and a quick note right away but said she wanted to introduce his name to me with a picture of him with a sign she had made, and didn’t do that until they went home the next day) We didn’t FaceTime for days afterwards and even then it was hurried. I offered again to come visit as soon as she said the word. She said she was super overwhelmed and couldn’t handle any more visitors. I get being overwhelmed but we would be there to be helpful and take care of her not stress her out. Then something happened to me which really shook me up, I reached out to Beth because I really needed her and she ignored my message. I’m not the best at asking for help so I was a little vague but she has always picked up on things like this before. When I asked her about ignoring my message she said it was because her son had a scare and went to the ER, which I feel for her, but she never followed up on my message (Her son was fine btw) The final straw came when she posted pictures with the caption “(son) meeting all of his aunts and uncles!” - I thought i was considered an Aunt too?I finally confronted her about how everything had made me feel.

I have voiced complaints about them lowering the AC to 74 degrees at night. I tell them it’s not fair to me, because they are raising my electricity bill. My daughter says that I’m being unfair, and they should be allowed some control over the AC as they are paying me rent to live here. I told her they are paying me to live here, not paying for the utilities, so they have to leave the AC off or at 76.They are currently paying me around $875 a month plus $25 biweekly (in the winter $25 per month) for the lawn to be mowed.

She pays for internet (already included in the total) They buy their own food and they share with me, I also sometimes cook and share.I told her if she’s not okay with my rule, I can start charging her $500 for her side of the rent to live here, on top of what they already pay to cover their electricity.

They were hesitant to invite the girls at first because they're having a child free wedding but they wanted their kids to be an exception. At the same time they didn't want to worry about the kids in the wedding since they wouldn't be able to take care of them so they said they'd ended up hiring a babysitter.My mom and I objected to that and we said we'd watch the kids and take care of them during the wedding no babysitter needed. And they won't have to worry about it.But honestly during the wedding and the reception all my mom and I could think about was our enjoyment for the wedding and having fun. We tried to get other relatives to help us with the kids but nobody was willing. At some point I dropped the kids at my sister's in laws which my sister didn't like since she doesn't get along with them. At some point she brought me to the bathroom along with my mom and scolded us for not watching the kids and just dropping them off to other people especially the in laws.We tries to justify that we also wanted to have fun and it would just be for few minutes and we'd resume to taking care of them the rest of the night. We just wanted some time to enjoy ourselves as well. It was my sister's wedding after all.My sister wasn't having it and now she's still mad at us and doesn't accept our reasoning. AITA",

	"body" : "So just to start off, I'll be using an alt because most of my family members know my reddit. Last Monday was my nephew's 7th birthday. My SIL(32) and Brother(35) were both office workers so they get enough money to feed themselves and their son but not enough to buy fancy clothes or things they don't need. My boyfriend(20) and I(19) have been dating for a year now.  I was born pretty spoiled by my parents because I was the youngest child. I agree, I was not a good kid when I was young but I can assure that I've changed.So in the day of my nephew's birthday, it was a small party with his family only and no friends so the cake was big one layer chocolate cake but the thing was that it included nuts and I had a nut allergy. My nephew LOVE nuts so I can understand my SIL preparing a cake with nuts in it but there were no other food for me to eat. I'm also quite a picky eater so they did offer me some salad they already had but I declined mainly because I didn't want to be rude and didn't like salads. So later on, after wishing the birthday boy a happy birthday, I texted my boyfriend to come and bring a two layer strawberry cake we already had bought in our fridge. The thing about me is, I really enjoy cakes so I never miss out on them and always have at least one or two in my fridge when I want to eat it. My boyfriend comes after 20~25 minutes and brought the cake. The birthday was almost close to finishing when he arrived and I was hungry so I decided to eat the a little bit first and finish it later when I'm back home. So I asked my SIL politely if I can get the knife they had used to cut my cake. My SIL looked at me in disgust and told me \"You are a spoiled kid even though you are in university already. You have no shame and decided to bring a bigger cake to flex on us because you know you are richer than us\" (We aren't from the US so this is the roughly translated version) I was just shocked and apologized because I didn't know I was rude. My brother saw the commotion and came over and also scolded me for doing that but lighter. It didn't end badly as I left quickly but I think they were a bit rude when they said what they said and I shouldn't have been picky and just ate the salad instead, so AITA?",

The only issue is, they get super touchy with each other. Even in front of other people. I’m personally really grossed out by PDA and touchiness in public and they both know that too but sometimes they have issues with it. Yesterday we hung out and got lunch together and of course the whole time they were holding hands. Then when they finished my sister leaned her head against him. Then when we walked outside he literally KISSED HER FOREHEAD in front of me. It just felt so gross and disgusting to watch I actually gagged in my mouth a little bit.Then even at home he kissed her forehead more or she leaned her head on his shoulder and I just had enough of it so I left. Later that day I texted my sister trying to set a boundary, asking if they could keep the PDA and touching to a minimum while I was with them since it makes me really uncomfortable to watch. She laugh reacted the message and basically ignored everything I said and asked what PDA. I mentioned the hand holding and the cuddling and the kiss outside the restaurant. She acted confused and said it wasn’t PDA to cuddle with her husband in her own house. I said when I’m there it is definitely public and it makes me feel like I have to chaperone them or else they’re gonna get handsy or something. She said I was being stupid and that she wasn’t going to not hold hands with her husband just to make me comfortable in front of them. So not only is she doing all of this but she’s ignoring my boundary now.I said fine I just won’t come over anymore, expecting her to realize she could lose our relationship over this. She sent a shrug emoji and said “then don’t come over”. Now I feel ignored on top of everything. I talked to my parents hoping they could talk to her or help.

He had always been a very quiet person, to the point where he would barely talk to you, but I figured he was just being bashful. We celebrated with a graduation party held at his Dad's place, and I remember thinking that things were looking up for him.Well, at Christmas dinner, my father-in-law revealed to me that he works a low-level retail job at Walmart because he has \"crippling social anxiety\" and no employer will hire him, since he refuses to talk during interviews. I couldn't believe it. Computer science is a very in-demand degree, so you have to really try not to get a job in that field. I suggested that perhaps he should learn how to speak, since he's 22 years old, and laughed, but his father grew very defensive and told me that his son had \"been through hell\" and that my comments were rude.In hindsight, I admit that I probably should not have responded, but I felt incredibly insulted when my FIL called me rude.  I told him that my BIL's problems were entirely self-inflicted and then joked \"He didn't need a college degree to work at Walmart. Pretty sure he could've been a dropout to do that.\" At this point, the entire table was looking at me, and my wife even kicked me under the table. I had only stated the facts, and if his father knew that he utterly refused to talk to people, then it was a complete waste of money to send him to college. I'm sure he secretly regrets doing so, but can't bring himself to admit it.My mother suggested that we drop that topic and move onto something else, which I was more than happy to do. The mistreatment that I had received merely for expressing an opinion really soured my mood and left a bad taste in my mouth. It was as though everyone there felt that they could gang up on and discredit me, even when I knew in my heart that what I had said was correct. I've been trying to get my wife to see my point of view since yesterday, but every time I try giving her pointers on what her brother should do to improve his chances of getting hired, I get dismissed.

She asked a LOT of questions, but did good work and had great accuracy. It was the best of the 8 total people I manage and I was very impressed.Then she had to go for work training for a week, in Week 2.Then she got back, in Week 3, and her accuracy plummeted. Our process changes daily and she had not kept up with work. Clarissa came back seeming inattentive, unsure, and inaccurate. She made several serious errors multiple times and I had to closely supervise her work. I also told her that she was the only person who was \"doing the work differently\" because of those errors.Seeing that she was inaccurate - presumably panicking and unsure, she was also moving MUCH MORE SLOWLY than most of the other 7 people I manage! She was triple and 4x checking her work and I had to tell her to speed it up! She was doing about 20 tasks a day, the bare minimum, whereas others did 40-60 tasks (albeit with lower accuracy).Granted, I did check her work at the end of Week 3, and her accuracy was back to topping everyone else's.

However, I had to tell her to speed up again (and she did). Today, she did 42 tasks.But what annoyed me this week was that she seemed unsure of this one process after I questioned her about \"did she really complete a task.\" Like, please be more confident, you know?In the end, despite the fact that \"Clarissa\" had the highest accuracy, I chose \"Olivia\" to help me correct others' work.

A bridesmaid removed herself from my party because I asked her to soften up her bright fire hydrant color red hair. I’m a very easy go with the flow type of person, and have been very generous with taking in suggestions for my wedding including decoration, theme, and even hairstyles. This particular bridesmaid is the tallest in the group of females so she will already draw attention to herself, I/we all picked a dress that is very flattering to all of the girls, as we all know we all come in different shapes and sizes (not body shaming anyone at all, not where I’m going with this). My theme colors are grey, white and a deep maroon, with the bridesmaids dresses being that deep maroon color. The dress that was tried on was not that color as it was not in stock at the time of the fitting. Anyhow, I recently went to another event in which there was a young lady pretty much built like this particular person same hair color and pasty white skin, just like my person. The color dress she had on just happened to be the same color in which my bridesmaids will be wearing, needless to say that the look was not very flattering for this person and as sad as it is, the talk in the crowd regarding this person was very disheartening as well as disappointing that this still happens. I don’t want this for my person so I asked her if she could soften her color, I want this night to be special to me as well as my party since they will be a part of my special day.

	"body" : "So my girlfriend is really into me blowing raspberries (where you blow air into a soft part of a person's body and it makes a comical farting sound) and whenever we're at home it makes her giggle and smile. It makes her super happy and she's even told me it makes her feel like she's \"reclaiming her childhood\" (her's was really messed up and I'm definitely not going to get into it here with a bunch of strangers). She especially likes it when I blow raspberries on parts of her body which aren't her tummy, but still produce the expected sound, like her thighs, her arms, her cheeks, and her you-know-whats.For context, she works at a hair salon and I go in every other week to get my hair cut by her. She usually wears a black crop top for work because it's a more liberal place, and a few months ago, after my haircut, I blew a raspberry into her belly after she brushed me off and took off the apron. I did it ad a kind of thank-you. It was in the middle of the salon and was heard by many of her coworkers. I thought it was cute but later she told me that it was really embarrassing.I'm really confused because her coworkers have seen us kiss, and we've all hung out for drinks and they've even seen us drunk together and being super goofy. For additional context, I'm autistic and my partner isn't and I'm not sure if this is another instance of me not getting a social cue. I decided to do it again next week to see if she had a different reaction/if she just needed to get used to it in public. She didn't bring it up again but things feel tense. I've kept doing it and I'm not sure if she's angry at me or not but I think she is, but at the same time, I love doing it and I'm not going to stop.Seriously, am I the asshole just for expressing myself?",

	"title" : "AITA for finding my neighbour’s noise complaints ridiculous?",
	"body" : "I have lived in the UK for 13 years but am from Ecuador. I have an 8 year old non-verbal autistic son. His father hasn’t had anything to do with him, and I have raised him alone.When it started getting warmer around April-May and I was opening the windows more, my son started really enjoying blowing bubbles out of the window. He’d also blow them indoors sometimes, but he enjoys watching them float around in the wind and into the sky. He is non-verbal but does make sounds. He mainly makes these sounds when he’s happy or excited, so when he’s blowing bubbles he makes them. The bubbles keep him entertained and occupied for absolutely ages so I leave him to it whilst I have some time to myself.Around 2 weeks ago I had a letter through my door from a neighbour (to make this clearer - I live in an estate where there’s lots of other homes), saying that they felt “extremely guilty” for writing the letter but that my son’s noise has become too much for them and they asked if there’s any way he can be a bit quieter. I thought this was absolutely ridiculous, I took a picture and sent it to my family then threw the note in the bin.5 days ago as my son was at the window, I caught a glimpse of a girl across the road on her balcony. She was looking at me and was clearly upset. I opened the window and asked if there was a problem and she nodded. She then said “I don’t have any problem with him blowing bubbles, but why does he have to be so loud?” to which I replied that he’s non verbal autistic. Then a woman pulled her inside, and came outside to speak instead. She said that her daughter is also autistic and that the world doesn’t “revolve around my son” and that he’s “there for hours a day constantly screaming out the window”. Before I really got to answer she went inside her house and closed her balcony door. I went and stopped my son blowing bubbles for the rest of the day after that but then let him continue the next day.Well today I just had the housing officer come round to my house about noise complaints. I told her the situation, and she pretty much didn’t take my side at all. She said that people had apparently also reported that they’ve seen him almost climb out the window several times when i wasn’t looking, something which I was honestly quite surprised at. I said I haven’t seen him do that myself, and she told me someone had picture evidence of it but she refused to show me the photos. Then she gave me a warning and said that it’s “unacceptable” he’s at the window for so long and that he basically isn’t allowed to go there for long periods of time anymore. 10mins at most.I honestly just find this so ridiculous and unfair. My child has a disability and he finds comfort in doing something as harmless as blowing bubbles. AITA??TL;DR: My non-verbal autistic son makes noise while blowing bubbles out our window and my neighbours have complained about it but I think they’re being unfair.",

That is the nature of getting sneakers… sometimes your size is sold out.So I let him think I was mad for about 30 mins and when he tried to resolve it I said “I’m not even mad. That was just weird.

Jewel was bisexual before this but I've always had my suspicions because Jewel has only been with guys and only reads straight stories, sends me videos of men she finds attractive, and talks about having sex with men, never women. Jewel isn't asexual to my knowledge.It had been really random because during lunch one day at our college, Jewel sat down by me and said \"hey I'm a lesbian\", I hadn't wanted to say anything due to all of our friends sitting at the table getting really excited and hyping her up. But a week into Jewel being a lesbian, I was still getting sent the videos of men that she had found attractive and posts containing straight content. I feel as though that Jewel had only said that she was a lesbian because she wanted to fit in more with our group (but she had always fit in) or possibly get D to hook up with her since she was one of the only members of our group that hasn't had sex.During the summer break, Jewel had called me to say \"wanna see my boyfriend?\" I had obviously been confused because if Jewel is supposed to be a lesbian, wouldn't she have a girlfriend? When I said my opinion on it, Jewel immediately hung up on me and went to our entire group saying how I was being homophobic and not supporting her. My group had obviously been upset thinking that I was but after I explained my thoughts on the situation, the group has been more divided. Some support Jewel, some support me, and some just didn't want any part of it.I will admit Jewel has a problem when it comes to being herself. Like when I was diagnosed with being autistic, than Jewel thought she was autistic. L was having issues with her mom about their sexuality, and than a week later Jewel was also having issues with her mother over her sexuality.

I usually have a great relationship with my son and DIL, and see my granddaughter on alternate weekends due to the distance between us.This past weekend, out of the blue, my DIL sent me a photo of my GD with her lovely long hair cut down to a bob. Now don't get me wrong, it looked lovely and was very well done. So I expressed my shock as they have never even indicated to me she wanted her hair cut. After chatting to my DIL, I was shocked to learn that my GD had expressed a desire to have her haircut very short, and my son and DIL said to her it was fine and even discussed her getting a pixie cut or ever shorter than a bob. This to me is far too short, as I worry she will be bullied at school if she went in to school. So I simply stated my opinion to my DIL - a bob is fine, but please do not go any shorter.My DIL replies saying she couldn't promise that as they allow my GD to have full autonomy over her body, which I find ridiculous as she is 7! She is still a child and I think allowing such extreme haircuts be left up to a child is outrageous, quite frankly. So I said that wasn't correct, and that such decisions should always be made by the parents. Would they allow her to have a tattoo if she asked? My DIL didn't reply to this.Later on I messaged my son expressing the same sentiment. He replied saying I had nothing to worry about, so I again just reiterated to please do not cut her hair short. My son then replied saying I was being rude and overbearing, and need to keep my opinions to myself if they aren't helpful. I was taken aback as I at no point was rude I simply expressed my opinion that 7 is far too young for a little girl to have a shaved head.My son then remarked that she wouldn't be having a shaved head, and that they simply discuss options with my GD and guide her to the correct decision. So basically, if she said she wanted a shaved head they would allow it. I don't think this is correct at all, and after telling my son this, he told me to stop being ridiculous and to drop it.  He hasn't messaged me back since.I have no idea what has come over them. My son and DIL are fantastic parents and my GD is an amazing little girl, but this just seems so out of the blue that they are considering allowing a 7 year old girl to shave her head.Opinions please?",

We asked V (20 M)  to participate and he said he will take care of the last member for the team.Now the problem is he asked two people: our friend that moved away and comes to our town only occasionaly and a girl that just came from her trip and we haven't seen her in a month.He didn't think both of them would reply and both said they haven't hung out with us in a long time so they really want to go.I was so happy both of them could make it, but that ment we had to cut someone out. Since D doesn't really know two of them we taught it made most sense that she doesn't go. I mean the rest of us are experienced in quizes so we even had better chances of winning a prize that way.I told her the situation and that it would be best if she sits this one out. I felt kinda bad, but she said that it's okay and that it doesn't bother her.I invited her to hang out a few times since then, but she always declined. Maybe she is mad, I don't know. Now that I think about it, it was a bit rude, so AITA??EDIT:By the time the two friends responded, the enteries for the quiz ended. We couldn't make more teams.V asked a lot of people, these two responded in the same time and he asked me what to do.I don't think D wanted to go that badly, she just wanted to try it out since the rest of us always hype it up. I can go with her to another quiz anytime, but those two friends aren't staying for a long time.EDIT 2:Yikes, after reading all your unfiltered responses, I tried putting myself in her shoes. I really didn't think it was such a big deal, but from another perspective it's pretty bad.A mutual friend told me she even studied for the quiz, I realised she was more invested than I taught.I will apologise to D in person with those 3 and share the prize we got with her.",

His family also doesn't like Christmas either and I just can't wrap my head around it. I'm in a group chat with his family and they all love Halloween but hate Christmas.My boyfriend is also slow on getting gifts. He still hasn't gotten anyone anything yet and Christmas is in 1 week! We went shopping for gifts on Saturday and I could tell in his face he didn't want to do any shopping.My family and are huge on Christmas and we really go all in on decorations and the theme. We have Christmas parties and we go to Christmas festivals and light shows. Yesterday we had a Christmas party. My aunt asked my boyfriend if he was excited about Christmas and he told her \"not really\" my family was shocked and asked him why he wasn't excited and he told them the truth. He said a lot of things but it all came up to the money and ended off by saying \"... Christmas isn't Christmas unless you're okay with bankrupting yourself. My favorite day of the year is Dec 26 when Christmas is over\". My family gave me looks and I was so hurt and embarrassed.When everyone left he was helping me clean and we talked about what happened. I asked him why he told my family he didn't like Christmas AT A CHRISTMAS PARTY. He said he didn't want to lie and they asked him. I told him he could have just lied when they asked him about it and I asked him if he seriously didn't feel any jubilation over the holidays? He told me that the past few weeks has just cemented his dislike for the holidays and now i'm feeling crushed. It's my dream to get him to feel what I feel for Christmas and it feels like it's not going to happen. I was thinking maybe I should leave him after the new years.",

Basically, I have been getting in trouble a lot because I keep drinking milk out of a mortar (without pestle) because I enjoy the texture of the roughness on my lips and I do feel like I can get a hint of spices that actually makes quite a good flavour.However, this mortar is also my mum's favourite mortar, and she doesn't like seeing it get used because she feels like there is some residual germs - even though I clean it after I am done. And I am talking immediately after I am done using it.My mum keeps referencing how the porosity of the mortar means that it is harder to clean germs out of, and she definitely has a point, but I also know that most of our gut biome is very, very similar (a lot of the gut biome is passed from mother to child), so I feel she is overreacting. I also used to drink her breast milk and she didn't really seem to mind about my germs back then...I think I might be the Asshole because I refuse to use other mortars (they are a different material) and I recently let the cat drink out of one which I was told on reddit was a bad idea. So in this very specific context I have done the wrong thing before. I am not too sad if I have to stop my behaviour, I just want to see what everyone else thinks. I can drink from other things, and I would hate to hurt my mum. Please reddit, AITA?EDIT:Ok, ok. I have heard you and I will stop drinking out of the mortar immediately. Thank you to the people who suggested alternatives and empathised with the textual angle. And thank you to all who provided any form of feedback, I appreciate it and I will apologise to my mum as well. Thanks.",

	"body" : "I (43F) live in a rented apartment building with my partner (37F) who I have been with for ten years. We moved into our condo a year ago. It came with 2 parking spots. We have one car and do not use the other spot. The parking lot design is wall-car1-car2-car3-wall. We have spot 2 and 3. Our neighbor parks in spot 1 and often they are right on the line which is annoying.Anyways, I figured we could rent our spot for $200 a month /$2400 a year and put up a sign. We got one response. My partner then said that he didn’t want to do this. His reasons: he liked a spot for friends (we have had friends use our spot 3 times in 9 months, so $800 a friend), he thinks parking might be harder (we would be in spot 3 so would have a wall so it might be 10% harder), he might want a 2nd car (we have never discussed this and we would rent in a month to month so we could get the spot back) and he doesn’t want to deal with it (I would deal with logistics).He first said yes to renting and then no, and I don’t  agree or understand his reasons. He said we don’t need the money — $2400 is not life changing but it’s also not nothing to us —and he was rude to me when I tried to discuss this in detail, “I said no so do what I say.”I was frustrated and annoyed at this and my friends were surprised this was an issue - they said of course you would rent it, why wouldn’t you, that makes no sense.So I rented it to the person who wanted it — who I just realized is also person who parks obnoxiously in spot 1. I just told my partner and he flipped out, “why did you lie to me ? Why did you do when I said no? Why did you go behind my back. I can’t trust you.” He earns significantly more than me and does pay for 80% of things,I understand he’s not happy but i don’t feel I did anything wrong. I tried to talk to him about it, he was not making sense. He is furious and said I went behind his back and wants to break up. I did not think he would be happy but did not think he would react so extremely- shouting at me for over an hour. I said I was sorry he was upset but that I did not think he would get this worked up. He does not like not getting his way and in general when he says no to things (getting a cat, going somewhere exotic, etc) I do not do them (no cat, no trip to the places I’m most excited about etc ). He does suffer from anxiety which has been bad lately, but when I specifically asked if the parking spot was about anxiety or his reasons he said it was his reasons. I don’t want to break up but don’t understand his actions. So AITAH?",

	"title" : "AITA For not being happy that my SIL is pregnant and not congratulating her?",
	"body" : "AITA for not being happy that my (26F) SIL (32F) in pregnant? I found out 6/10/23 that my SIL is pregnant and is going to be giving my FIL and MIL their first grandchild. I have not congratulated her nor shared in the excitement of the first grandson for my FIL and MIL / nephew for my husband and younger SIL. I can’t bring myself to share their joy and excitement. Don’t get me wrong, a baby is a super exciting thing to happen to any couple and I am happy my FIL and MIL are getting a grandkid, I’m just upset it is going to be my SIL giving it to them and not me.For some context, here is why I am feeling how I am feeling.My SIL married her husband in 2018 but chose to focus on a career she hated rather than trying to start a family. I married my husband in 2019 and we decided almost immediately to begin trying for a baby and build our family. 3 months after getting married, I removed my birth control and we began trying for a baby. 3 years and many, many failed pregnancy tests later, my SIL approached me at Thanksgiving to commiserate about how hard it is to be TTC with no luck. I assumed her and her husband had been trying since getting married, but she told me she had only started trying a few months earlier. I remember the early days of trying when I was hopeful every month only to be let down by a negative pregnancy test, so I talked with her about it. She told me of some vitamins and such she had found online that were supposed to be good. I thanked her for the information and looked into them and did actually end up purchasing them to try. Still no luck.Fast forward a few months, neither my SIL or I were pregnant. Now it’s around January/February and the whole family is at my FIL and MIL’s house. My SIL, husband, MIL, and younger SIL were talking when my SIL tells me I need to try something. I am an extremely picky eater and I strongly dislike trying new things, so I asked what it was. She told me it is a green juice that is supposed to help regulate women’s hormones. I said no thank you because I have tried green juices before and find them repulsive. We go a bit back and forth of her insisting and me saying no thanks. Then my SIL tells me that I need to stop being so selfish and that I need to eat better and if I weren’t so selfish I would have an easier time getting pregnant. To make a long story short, I took a sip, gagged because it was gross, asked my husband if we could leave, and cried the whole way home because I was so upset about how I was forced to “try” something I already knew I hated and what my SIL said to me.Fast forward again to June. My husband went to his parents house earlier in the day, I stayed home until closer to the time we were going to meet for dinner and met my husband at his parent’s house. When I get there, I’m shown the box my SIL gave my FIL for Father’s Day. She announced she was pregnant. I was instantly fighting back tears and had to fight tears the entire evening. When we were in the car driving to the restaurant for dinner I couldn’t keep the tears away so I silently cried and wiped the tears when we arrived. My MIL could tell I was sad but didn’t say anything. When my husband and I left to head home, he gave SIL a hug and I said bye to the rest of the family. I cried silently the whole way home and then sobbed until I couldn’t cry anymore when we finally made it home.I have not been able to think about my SIL being pregnant without tearing up since because I don’t think it is fair that she gets to say such nasty things to me about me not being able to have a baby and then go and get pregnant so easily. My MIL also wants me to help with the baby shower later this month and my husband wants me to pick out the gift for my SIL for the baby shower. I want nothing to do with any of it, but guess I will help with setting up the baby shower because it’s family and that’s what you do for family, but I told my husband that he is in charge of getting the gift for his sister.Now, having just passed the 4 year mark of TTC, I know I have severe PCOS and I likely don’t even ovulate. I have started some medications that will hopefully help me regulate my cycles and start ovulating so hopefully I can have a baby. Turns out I’m not infertile because I’m “selfish”, but I still feel that I need to somehow prove to my SIL that she isn’t better than me and I’m not broken by finally getting pregnant.So, AITA for not being happy my SIL is pregnant and still not having congratulated her for it?",

During that time, I had save about 1200$. When the time came to open my first bank account, I asked for my money.My mother simply refused to acknowledge the fact that I had been able to save 1200$ and after over a month of fighting, in which she threw distincts objects, kicked me out of the house, stoped paying my college, etc, I simply gave up and deemed my money lost. A couple of weeks after they let me back to the house, I went on a trip, and upon my return I found that my mother donated my Xbox 360 and TV to charity.I wasnt in any financial position to move away, I dont have family, my friends left town after graduation. I was simply stock in that position and had to endure anything.Now, a couple of weeks ago they asked me to do some work on the IT department of their company. I had no problem, they new my rates and didnt mind the invoice for 500$. Today I woke up and saw that they where planning a 3 week vacation, I went to their house and ask my mother for the payment since I was not going to wait 3 weeks for my money.My mother decided that she wasnt going to pay me and repited the same tactic of three years ago. Only that this time I wasnt going to let them fuck me, first, my mother had given me a money to send through Western Union a couple of days ago since although she thinks that she is the most inteligent person in earth, she still cant figure out how to send money through WU, I had forgotten to go to the store to do the transfer, so I decided to keep the money and send to her company an invoice in which I calculated interest rates, inflation, and administrative expenses for the originial 1200$, the Xbox 360, games, TV and the recently owed 500$.My mother went batshit crazy, scream through the phone, called me a thief, scammer, etc. I simply said \"Mamm, its not my problem\". She threatened to sue me, yet I made really good lawyer friends in college who work at top firms, upon giving them the info they told me that I can win the case, counter sue her and also sue her for lost revenues of the money that she originaly owed me since through some legal bs can be accounted to the company I built.So for just 500$ I have collected 3000$ and probabily by sueing I can win a lot more. Obviously my father isnt ok with my fight against my mother and called me an A Hole. Yet, when she was throwing shit at me three years ago and knowing that my mother was basically stealing from me.",

She's never dated or anything so it was really an adjustment last summer when she introduced us to this guy she'd apparently been seeing for a while.He's alright I guess but I've always felt the whole situation was weird. I've tried to just suck it up since I love my mother and want her to be happy, but I can't help but feel like this guy is an intruder. I've already put my own feelings aside and gone along with so much because I know it's what my mother wants. Before he moved in, she sat us down and talked, made sure it was okay. I honestly wasn't happy but decided to just go with it - I'll be moving out soon, anyway.But he's not a member of the family, he's an outsider, and I still feel like that even though they got married in February. I try to keep things friendly but I can probably count on one hand how many times I've had a one on one conversation with him; my siblings seem to like him a lot. Well...it's reaching a point I just can't cope anymore. They've apparently been looking into adopting a child. Not just any child, but specifically a five year old boy she had been “mentoring”. His father was dead and now his mother has gone to jail and lost parental rights, there are no other family members for him to go to and my mom is just sick over it. I feel like she’s become obsessed with the idea of saving him, both her and the husband are trying to figure out how to do this 24/7.I feel like I’m the only one with any sense and finally blew up. I told them both that this is ridiculous and makes no sense. My mother already has three children. Taking some random boy off the street is just weird and is going to change ALL of our lives forever, even though he’s not even family and never will be, just like the husband. I asked why we weren’t enough all of a sudden and my mom didn’t have an answer and started crying. I told her I’ve kept my mouth shut this whole time but it’s going too far. They said they “have their hearts set” on adopting this random kid and are sorry I feel this way, but it won’t change anything.

I’m Latino, my friend is South Asian, his bf is American (I think 3rd generation Italian-American) and their friend is South Asian.His bf starts talking to me about how he recently went to Spain and met another Latino from the same country as my parents. How he was cool and I ask if he lived in Spain. He doesn’t but is moving to Australia to learn English. I’m like “Dope. Yeah Spain is pretty racist”. I don’t think anything of it, just an innocuous comment. He then proceeds to tell me Spain isn’t racist and I'm wrong. I say yeah they are. And he starts to explain how you can’t be racist against Latinos because Latino isn’t a race. I really didn’t think it was that serious and kept just trying to move on but he needed me to understand how Spain is very liberal and open and not racist. How they embrace the, in his words “white Latinos”, I just respond to his statements trying to drop the convo by saying things like “well I guess it’s just the ones with more indigenous blood”. By the end I just say it’s not that serious and it was an innocuous comment.He then says “it was tacky”. I ask what was tacky? “It’s tacky to bring up racism as the first thing you say when someone mentions a country”. I told him I don’t think it was because it’s really not that serious. Thankfully, I had a baby shower to go to and ordered my Uber to excuse myself.This man was aggressive and condescending this whole time when I just didn’t even think this was a big deal. If he was really so offended by something that has nothing to do with him, he could have just pulled me aside and let me know his feelings one on one instead of talking down to me in front of other people.If I try to to think about it from his perspective, I would say that I could be the asshole for making a stupid comment about something political during an Eid get together. He is a Spanish teacher so it could be that he feels very protective about Spain and that is why he was so personally offended. Besides teaching he doesn't have any ties to Spain (I on the other hand have cousins who moved there a few years ago whom I plan to visit next month).Personally, I don't see why he couldn't just talk to me about it directly instead of starting an argument in front of other people.So Reddit, AITA?TLDR: I make an innocuous comment about Spain being racist. My friend's bf whose only tie to Spain is teaching Spanich is offended and starts talking down to me and won't drop the convo. Neither of us has apologized.",

I drive and she doesn't, so she's been doing combination of bus + subway + taxi for almost a year.

I only agreed to do this as long as the cat was promptly removed as soon as the weather warmed up and that the cat stay in her room.

Pet bed, food, litter, etcA week passed and the weather warmed. Yesterday, I told her Cheese had to go. She seemed confused, which I knew was her way of pretending she didn’t know what I was talking about. I reminded her of the agreement, which she promptly tried to argue with me about. Said she had seen me pet him and that I seemed to like him, so she couldn’t understand why I was kicking out her cat. I told her the cat wasn’t hers, it was simply a stray she had been feeding and named. This caused an outburst, and I quickly put my foot down. She eventually got some sense back and just asked that I wait until she got back from work so she can find somewhere for the cat to be. I initially agreed on this, but later I found that the cat had pooped and pissed on the living room carpet.I have no patience when it comes to bodily fluids so I quickly picked the cat up and put it outside where it came from. Texted her that the cat will be right where it usually is. She then blew up my phone, calling me the most awful things. Saying I was heartless and that she was calling her mom to come get her later that evening.Her mom called asking what was going on and I explained. Her mom disagreed with my approach, saying it was kind of a dick move to just remove the cat without warning Mia. I disagree as it’s my house and I gave her a deadline and rules to follow. I was not going to have an animal pissing in my carpets either.My daughter is currently not talking with me, and has apparently taken the cat to her moms. Fine with me, but I can’t help but wonder if I really am an asshole here? Or was I right to put my foot down. I really think Mia was hoping I’d get attached.",

	"body" : "I’m (18F) in the process of applying to a competitive university course and its caused quite a bit of stress in my household and I’ve been having my parents help me with some aspects of it. Today there was a little stress concerning some work experience I had completed (not really relevant to situation) I was pretty stressed and to resolve the issue I had to contact the admissions office and communicate a mistake I had made. I was discussing with my mother the contents of the email and she was telling me now wasn’t the time to discuss this (we were out, like in town). I agreed but we were all still bickering and it had been around 10 minutes of this. My dad grew up in a household where they weren’t really allowed to express themselves fully. This has resulted in issues within our current family dynamic because my mother and I express ourselves and we usually have heated arguments/ conservations that I feel are necessary to resolve any issue and not cause any resentment. My father has many issues with this and always tries to shut down my mothers and I’s disputes, no matter the topic, as soon as our voices raise he tries to shut it down. I disagree with this because I believe sometimes you need to hash things out. My mother and I are close so our arguments always resolve themselves but when my dad interjects to stop the conflict makes it harder for us to let go.Alright so today me and my mom were on the verge of concluding our conflict, my father was outside the car and came inside halfway through one of my sentences, he immediately said: “Alright I thought we were done talking about this the conflict needs to stop”. I told him we are about to finish our discussion but he insisted it was already over. I got a little frustrated and told him he can’t just control when we get to talk like a patriarch. My dad goes absolutely ballistic and yells at me commanding respect, I know I have a sharp tongue but right now I really need advice to whether I was the asshole.some extra info: I totally understand not wanting constant conflict in your home where you’re meant to feel comfortable but my mom and I don’t have that many conflicts and when we do they hardly last longer than 30 minutes, and sometimes me and my mom even agree a certain conflict is a little blown out of proportionEDIT: i understand i misused the word patriarch.. lets just blame the fact im bilingual LMAO.. i was trying to say that its not fair for him to tell us when or not we can communicate",

So my mother asked me if I'd instead housesit for them. \"Housesitting\" as she explained it meant taking care of their little dog and also feeding their four hens and collecting whatever eggs they layed, and also letting them out of their coop for an hour or so in the eveningI'm kind of an introvert who lives in his own world. I'm divorced, no kids, and I just sort of like to be left alone., but I did agree to housesit even though I really didn't want to.I work the night shift, and so I went to my parent's house in the early morning right after I had gotten off shift. When I arrived everyone was scrambling to get out of the door. As she was leaving my mom said \"OK, so take good care of [the dog.] Feed the chickens their seed and mealworms once per day and make sure they have water. Let them get some exercise in the evening. They'll return to their coop at sundown on their own.\"I just said \"Got it. Enjoy your trip.\"She then--as she was walking out the door--said \"Oh, and also water my plants at least every other day.\"My parents have a number of small flower and shrub gardens throughout their property--which are entirely my mom's projects. For some reason felt really, really annoyed by this request. I didn't really want to have to spend my week--which included my days off--at my parent's house, taking care of their animals, but I did it. But I never said that I'd do garden work, too.When my mom came back she saw that her plants were turning brown and she got annoyed with me. I think she should have hired a gardener to take care of her plants if it was important to her, but she says that watering her plants would have only taken at most 20 minutes and that I should have just helped her out.

If he cried, I asked him to take him outside, and clean up after him if necessary, while I was in the shower. He said he would listen and take him out, but would not clean up. He said that it was my job since it was my dog. I argued that he still gets puppy snuggles and all the benefits of having a puppy in the house, so he could theoretically clean up one time while I was showering.

She writes her own scripts, made her own short film two years ago, and is considering film school for college.She found out that the big university in our city has a film program that was about to start production on a full-length movie, completely ran by the film students. She contacted the team and we all met together to talk about our daughter joining the project as a volunteer production assistant so she could gain experience during the two weeks they'd be filming.So she did, and the first day of filming, I promptly dropped her off at the set. (Our daughter can't yet drive to places on her own. She's been learning how to drive off and on since she was 15 and got her permit, but she doesn't have her license yet and we're not comfortable with her driving on her own, especially to unknown locations.)First day, my daughter didn't leave the set until 8pm...nearly a 12-hour day for her. Second day was similar, and then the third day, after getting there at 7amish, my daughter called me to pick her up at nearly 10/11pm.After the third day, I had enough. That is a ridiculous amount of time and has to be a violation of some labor law somewhere. Not to mention, I have to stay in that part of town to pick her up, not knowing when she'd call and not wanting to leave her alone waiting for me, especially at night, so for those three days, my son (11M) and I had to drive around trying to find things to burn time. It's unfair to all of us.I admit I was angrier than I would have liked, but when I picked her up that night, I told her what they're making her do is unacceptable, unfair and she's emailing them that night that she is quitting. She insisted 12/13/14-hour long work days are \"normal\" in the film world, but I still made her go through with the email.My daughter has been since sulking around the house. To me, my decision made sense, which has also been backed up by my wife. AITA?ETA: I know these posts have a penchant for attracting moody teenagers who use this forum to rant against the minor complaints they have against their parents. Can any PARENTS/30+ adults chime in?ETA 2: Some things are being missed here. Maybe I overshot with making her call the whole thing off...maybe. But there a lot of people in the comments insisting I am such an unsupportive parent, when newsflash, I said in the first paragraph of my post that she made a short film not too long ago. That was a short film WE largely funded, because the grant she won from a local film co-op barely covered anything. We rented out a studio so she could hold auditions, paid for props, drove her to set and to the premiere, my wife helped design a lot of the set...I could go on.

He was already moved out by then, and he never stole from our parents or anything like that, so it could've been worse. Still though, we were all very worried and he never talked to us unless to ask for money.He finally hit rock bottom and went to rehab a year ago, and has been clean since. He's trying to rebuild relationships with the family, but we've mostly kept him at arms length until recently. The issue is he doesn't seem to understand that the recovery never ends. He never went to NA after rehab, he calls himself a recovered addict instead of recovering, and he got a girlfriend a month after he got out even though you're supposed to wait a year.She's a nice girl and she isn't an addict, but I worry my brother has given her the wrong impression. I've heard her refer to him as a former addict, which is not a thing. She acts like he's completely fine, and has no issues to work out. I'm worried she doesn't understand what she got herself into.My brother and her were invited to Easter, the first gathering he was invited to since he got clean. It was all going fine, but my brother mentioned how happy he was to have his family back after being recovered.

I don’t have or particularly like children, but I had a mother that I would consistently show my appreciation for, so I’m not keen on the excuse that “it's just a parent’s job”. My GF is the kindest woman with the most forgiving heart, so she completely ignores the lack of gratitude.Nell is at our home at the moment and requires her mom for everything. She needs her opinion on almost every decision she makes, interrupts her while she’s trying to relax, and asks her mom to go out with her on weekends and days off instead of allowing her to have some time for herself or with me. I honestly think it’s really draining for GF to have a codependent daughter and she may be getting burnt out, and it’s also hard for us to strengthen our relationship with Nell always around, so I offered to take her on a relaxing couples getaway. GF wasn’t sure about leaving Nell home at first, but she’s 19 and lives alone for most of the year, so I really didn’t see the issue. Eventually, Nell said she’d be fine so GF agreed to go with me.However, Nell has started complaining to GF about not feeling well, which is making my GF have second thoughts about leaving her at home. I thought since she takes care of herself when she gets sick at college it was very selfish of Nell to stress her mother out right before a relaxing getaway, so I decided to have a chat with her about boundaries. I told her that she as an adult is too dependent on her mom and that it was draining for her, and that she needed to deal with some of these things herself for her mother’s sake.Nell told her mom about our conversation, and I thought she would have encouraged her mom to go on the trip, but now my GF is furious with me. She said that she doesn’t care how old Nell gets, she will always put her daughter first and never wants Nell to feel guilty for needing her mom. I get that she’s a parent, but I don’t think it’s healthy to put anyone’s needs above your own and pointed out that she can’t take care of Nell if she isn’t taking care of herself. My GF told me that I have no business telling her how to be a parent since I’m not one. I do believe that Nell was being selfish by not thinking about her mom and that my GF needed to set boundaries by taking a break from Nell’s neediness, and I might feel differently for a younger child but Nell is old enough to understand that her mother is human too and she can take care of herself once in a while for her sake, but GF is very unhappy with me and Nell believes that I overstepped as well.

She said she was planning to go there for a little over two weeks, which happens to be over the holidays and cuts into a week of the new semester. This would mean our father would have to drive my brother to school for a week until she comes back. Since my father works full time, I suggested she could shorten her visit to around 10 days to avoid disrupting our routines so much. This would allow her to be back in time to resume driving us when the new semester begins. However, my father would have to adjust his schedule and potentially take some time off to be able to do this. When I told my mother that this might be too disruptive for our family's daily routines and that she should probably shorten the trip a little, she got really upset and said that I was being selfish, prioritizing my convenience over her opportunity to see her dying father one last time, although I only asked her to cut her trip short a few days, and still go for 10 days instead of 14 - 18. She hasn't talked to me since then, and it's causing a lot of tension in our house.

Finally, I had enough of her nonsense, and I started raising my voice, telling her that money doesn't grow on trees and that she's nuts if she thinks we're going to be able to afford a house later this year if we don't save now.I then told her that she needed to learn how to control her emotions and stop being so entitled.  I even suggested that she attend therapy to begin being a more level-headed and rational person.  She absolutely erupted at this, accused me of sexism, and told me that if she were a man, there's no way I would have said what I said.  I laughed in disbelief and told her that she clearly has emotional problems, as well as delusions, and that therapy could really help her out.  As she stormed off, I told her that I was only trying to help her, but she never even acknowledged me and simply slammed the bedroom door shut.Now I'm worried that she will spend money lavishly just to spite me and that her destructive behavior will sabotage our financial goals.  I want my wife to see things from my perspective, but I think she may have a personality disorder that needs fixing by a professional.  I'm totally exhausted by the situation, and I feel like a constant pawn in my wife's twisted games.  She's still in the bedroom and refuses to talk to me, even after I slid a list of therapists under the door.  AITA?",

	"body" : "Hi… So my sister is currently mad at me for essentially saying she was lucky our dad forced her to marry her husband.The backstory is that my sister was sleeping with her husband before they were married and my family found out and it wasn’t good because we’re Muslim so sex before marriage isn’t allowed and her husband wasn’t Muslim so it was even worse from my dad’s POV. Her husband said he would marry my sister to try to calm things down when everybody found out… The thing is my sister was angry at him because they had already broken up because he said something about how it was “just sex” between them so she didn’t want to marry him, especially since she felt like he was only offering to try and look like the hero.Long story short… my dad “forced her” to get married.Things have worked out well for my sister. She honestly has a good life and her husband has basically given her everything she could ever want and is really good to her. She’s said she’s happy and she loves him herself multiple times so I don’t really understand why she’s so angry at me and we all know she wouldn't have the life she has without him.I said that she was lucky that she married her husband when she did and things worked out in her favour when we were discussing how bad our cousin’s life has been recently. I don’t think I said anything so bad since our cousin is going through financial hardship because of her husband and how she basically has to raise their children alone because he’s lazy and doesn’t help or provide for the family at all. But my sister took it really badly and went on this rant about how she wasn’t lucky and how she didn’t deserve what happened to her. She’s even mad at her husband and basically told him she doesn’t want to talk to him and he should go away for a little while even though he didn’t do anything.AITA?",

My wife says that if she does not want to share it I cannot force her and ruin her birthday.Ethan is now livid at me, accusing me of ruining his birthday, but I told her that it's out of my territory now.

	"body" : "This may be a little complicated, but here it is….I (29f) wanted to throw a surprise 30th birthday party for my husband. I got in contact with friends he hadn’t seen in years at the beginning of the year and have been in the works of planning this for a long time.Some of the friends, our closest included, live over 90 minutes away, so it was taking quite a bit of coordination to figure out when we could do this.Right around Valentine’s Day, we all decided Sunday, May 14th would be the one and only day that would work for everyone his entire birth month. We made the plan, and I texted my mother in law this message (verbatim): “Can you watch the kids for me on Sunday, May 14th? I’m trying to plan a surprise birthday party for James (fake name), but if you can’t, no big deal, I can manage.”.She said “yes” and that was that.About a week and a half before the party, I realized the holiday it was on. It hadn’t even dawned on me, as my own kids are too young to do anything on that day (3 and 1), and I don’t have a mother of my own. It was too late to cancel or change the date at that point.During the week before, I called MIL to ask her what worked for her for dropping off or picking up the kids, etc. She said she would bring some food over so I didn’t have to cook. I thought this was weird, but thanked her and asked if she would be taking the kids with her then. She was utterly confused and said she planned to be there and that she would watch the kids during the party so I didn’t have to.I told her the point was for her to take them out of the house because, with them being young, they would want to go to me for everything and I needed to set up, host, and clean up. I said I was asking for a babysitter, and I’m sorry I didn’t make that clear.She then went on to tell me I was purposefully excluding her from HER son’s birthday, and how could I expect her to watch my children on her Mother’s Day, etc. I was then called selfish, self centered, and neither she or my husbands brother (32m) attended. The brother made a comment about “treating her like unpaid help” and he wouldn’t take part.I tried to explain to her that I wasn’t excluding her, and she was welcome to attend, but the original ask was for a favor of being a sitter but that wasn’t about her. She hung up on me, and angry texted James about it, ruining the surprise aspect of the party.She still won’t talk to me, and my husband has told me that I royally messed up, but….I really don’t feel like I did?edits to respond to most frequent comments20 minutes later I am fully aware of how much of an asshole I am, so I will be making sure to make a full apology.I had intended for this to be just friends (and the brother, because they are inseparably close). Husband wanted to “act like a young adult” for his birthday because he’s been really low lately, so I was trying to do something for him.We always were going to do something with his family on his ACTUAL birthday.By the time I realized when Mother’s Day was, we had already made plans in motion. People were traveling a long way and I couldn’t change it.I had thought when I asked for a SITTER it would be away. She told me I was excluding her. I was trying to say “if you want to come by all means, please do, but I was asking for a favor of babysitting when I asked two months ago. You wouldn’t be babysitting if you’re a guest, but you can definitely be a guest”.Again, I hear you reddit, I’m a jerk, thank you for making me realize I’m just being a jerk.",

Her birthday was in May but she couldn’t figure out what she wanted for her for birthday so I decided to surprise her with a massage at a local spa. Her job is very stressful and I thought this would be a nice way for her to relax. My GF hates surprises so I told her in advance what her gift was going to be. She seemed excited when I told her what I was planning. Fast forward to earlier this week and I find out not only has she not used the gift card yet but she plans on never using it. She toldme that she isn’t really a spa girl. I told her why didn’t she tell me that when I told her what I was going to get her, and she stated that “she didn’t want to hurt my feelings because she did think it was a sweet gift”. So with me obviously being pretty upset she offered to pay me back for the gift card if I couldn’t get a refund. I checked and couldn’t get a refund. Once I found out I couldn’t get a refund I decided to let my sister use the card so it wouldn’t go to waste. My GF tends to forget things so I reminded her that I she owed me money, and she got really defensive about it. She said that she didn’t feel like she needed to pay me back now because the gift card was used. My responses was that it really isn’t about the money but it’s the principle of the matter. I told her she should have spoken up earlier and not let me buy it if she knew she wasn’t going to use it. We went back and forth for awhile with her eventually just going to bed and us not speaking about it. I just want some outside opinions about the matter :)Update: so had a talk this morning apologized profusely, and it lead to another not so good conversation. So yea I was the asshole here and probably just ruined my relationship. Guess that is what I deserved. Thanks for the feedback everyone",

My daughter considers this 25-year-old woman her best friend despite their age difference. She frequently invites her friend to come over to our place and they spend a lot of time together. In fact, my daughter seems a bit infatuated with her friend's physical appearance (she is indeed extremely beautiful) and follows her around most of the time.There was not much tension leading up to the match, and both of them seemed to ignore the fact that they were about to play against each other. They did play a few practice games together and my daughter beat her friend in all of them. Anyways, when they played the match, my elder daughter was winning comprehensively. She won the first set 6-0 and was leading 5-0 in the second set. During one of the breaks, her friend, who was losing badly, felt like she was cramping up a bit. Her sister was watching the match and could have helped. She also had the option of withdrawing. To my surprise, she had a conversation with my daughter but did not request her own sister's help. Apparently, she wanted her daughter to help her stretch muscle a bit and my daughter agreed. I was mad at her but couldn't do anything. My daughter could never say \"no\" to her friend's request. They took a break and went to the locker room to try and improve her cramp. They returned after five minutes and my daughter's opponent seemed to have recovered fully. My daughter still won the next game to win the match 6-0 6-0, which is the heaviest possible defeat in tennis. After the match was over, my daughter's friend pretended as if she hadn't tried to cheat. She gave my daughter one of her charming (but fake) smiles, kissed her at the net, and sat beside her throughout the trophy presentation. They also took a lot of selfies together.After the match, I told my daughter in private that she shouldn't have helped her opponent, to which she responded that it was her best friend and \"not a regular opponent\". I specifically told her that this friend of hers was a sore loser who was pretending to have cramps to divert her attention away from the game. My daughter replied that she is absolutely certain that her friend was cramping; she had to stretch her muscle and consume some solution before she could play again. I pointed out the fact that she could have requested to be treated outside instead of going to the locker room. My daughter argued that \"some problems\" couldn't be treated in public and the whole thing had to be carried out in private to avoid \"embarrassment\". I have no idea why my daughter shouldn't be a part of this \"public\". I still insisted that she stay away from this weird friend of hers who is a sore loser and was trying to manipulate my daughter's infatuation with her to her advantage?

He saw me dancing on him and got upset and heart broken. I always told him “not yet” because I felt bad about hurting him when he asked to be with me.He’s written love songs about me , and it was performed by a buddy of ours (we are all in the music community. Love concerts and shows) This was the first month of their relationship. His girlfriend Abby put the pieces together that it was about me. I was introduced as just a platonic friend at first btw, which I can understand her confusion.Anyways, I guess Abby didn’t like how often we texted and talked. And how I would check up and ask about their relationship. Like if they moved in together and stuff. So slowly, he’s been distancing himself from me. Apparently she said to him “History is history. But when it makes it’s way into a relationship, it becomes the present” That’s pretty toxic for not letting your boyfriend have a friendship with somebody he’s known forever.Our friend group goes to music shows a lot, and I’ve noticed she doesn’t go every time. And she’s quiet. All of us are very extroverted. So it’s off putting and makes me and two of my other girl friends in the group uncomfortable.

She then kept talking about how her autism explained somethings when she was a kid like the fact she refused to go to school and was very physical and volatile trying to get her to get to school, she was often late to places if she had to go somewhere and so on.I decided to say something and firstly I reminded her she doesn't have autism yet and I said to her even if she did get diagnosed with autism she can't blame everything on her autism and mental health like being physical or volatile as a child and she needs to accept responsibility and not lay it of like \"Oh I got autism and I was physical and volatile as I child because of that.\"She also mentioned that's why she's always late because of her autism. I get that some people will always be late but I do personally find it rude if someone's late regardless if they're always are late. Again, I told her she can't completely blame that on the autism she isn't yet diagnosed with and needs to accept some responsibility and understand it's her fault half the time.After I said what I said my sister ran off crying and my family started shouting at me calling me an asshole for getting my sister upset when I know she's autistic. Again I said she hasn't yet been diagnosed with autism so she isn't autistic yet and until she gets a diagnosis I won't say she's autistic and I said she still needs to accept some responsibility for things that happened like her being physical and volatile as a kid. By blaming it on her \"autism\"  they're teaching her it's okay to be physical and volatile because she has \"autism\".My family think I've gone too far and now I'm not on speaking terms with them.

	"body" : "My partner (M26) & I (F23) have been together for 8 years. Around 3 years into our relationship he became convinced that he has something wrong with his throat. Every morning he wakes up and has to take a shower to “clear out his throat”. This consists of him coughing as hard as he can, hacking, spitting, etc for at the very least 15 minutes but can go upwards of 30 minutes. He does this every single morning between 5-6:30 am. I’ve pushed him many times to try and get a family doctor, but he’s “always too busy”. I’ve contacted doctor offices to ask if they were taking patients and tried to do it on his behalf, but I couldn’t. At one point, he thought the issue was his teeth, so I contacted a dentist for him, I was able to create a file on his behalf, got him an appointment, he went one time, but has refused to contact or go back since. We have 2 children (3 & 5 months), so at the point I pretty much have given up trying to get him help. I’m worn thin between trying to take care of myself & our children, (one having to be monitored for scoliosis, me having a laundry list of my own problems I’m seeing a psychiatrist for)This has been our problem lately. We have one bathroom, and that bathroom is smack dab in the middle between our 2 bedrooms. It wakes us up every single time. I’ve asked him to wait until we’re all awake to do that, which we normally wake up at 7:30. But in his words, he doesn’t think it’s fair for him to have to sit around in pain until it’s convenient for me. I’ve tried explaining my point of view, we’re tired, I exclusively breastfeed our baby & have to wake up throughout the night to feed so it’s exhausting being woken up every day as early as 5 am because all you hear is coughing that’s echoing in your small bathroom. I’ve tried alternate solutions so that everyone is happy, like putting rolled towels under the door to block noise, sleeping in the downstairs living room. But there’s literally no way to escape the sound. I honestly consider it sound torture. This morning, we were all woken up again at 6 am and I got annoyed. I made a comment to him saying “thanks for waking us up again” He thinks I’m the asshole because I’m not being considerate of him or his pain. I think he’s the asshole because he refuses to get himself help and continued to make us suffer for it.Am I the asshole for wanting my partner to wait until our children & I are awake to cough?Edited to add: he has seen an ENT doctor, the doctor said he didn’t see anything wrong besides his throat being red & irritated. He suggested for him to stop smoking, which he still does.",

At age 7 I’ve been lying at about liking my mom’s cooking. As you might’ve guessed, I really didn’t like it but I didn’t want to hurt her feelings so I sucked it up. When my mom found out I really didn’t like her cooking, she wasn’t upset but told me it wrong to lie and she wanted me to be honest with my feelings. So since then, I‘ve been completely honest with everything I say which both my parents seem to approve of…until now.In the past few weeks, I’ve been really getting annoyed with the both of them. I won’t list everything they did that I’ve had issues with, but my mom kept forgetting to pick me up from school, my dad lecturing me about chores (which I often don’t have time to do due to homework and school projects), and I’ve been getting so aggravated with the both them that I say “every time I think of you, I only think of the negative aspects, and you need to fix that right now” in which one of them usually responds with “I’m sorry you feel that way.”Back to today. My dad was at work and I was helping mom get the house ready for some guests (some friends of hers) that were coming over to have dinner with us. She kept getting frustrated with me because I did none of the chores yesterday (like I said, homework got in the way) and I sucked it up until she lectured me for the 50th time on how I’m not a little kid anymore and I need to pitch in. I had enough and began to tell her that every time I think of her I only think of the negative aspects and that she needs to fix that, but then she interrupted me, went off the handle and started screaming. I don’t remember what was said exactly, but basically it all came down to her saying that I’m a jerk for constantly saying that to her and dad, that I’ll never be perfect myself and that because of my attitude everyone will only think of my negative aspects. I tried to tell her that I’m annoyed and I’m just trying to be honest with her like she wanted me to when I was 7, but she didn’t want to hear any of it. She then went into her and dad’s bedroom by herself and locked herself in to cool off.Am I the A hole here?",

My brother has fainting spells so Sugar alerts him to lay down when he's about to faint.My brother was sleeping this afternoon, so I went and got Sugar quietly (didn’t wake my brother) and took off her collar and vest to let her know that she was going to play. We live literally right door to a small dog park, so me and my friend took Sugar there. We would have been back in the house in less than two minutes if something happened. I also sent my brother a text telling him to stay laying down until we got back so he wouldn't fall if he fainted. About 30 minutes in Sugar started barking (normal when she’s away from my brother for a period of time) so we quickly took her back. My brother had woken up and was mad that we had taken Sugar without his permission.He started arguing with me and I was pissed because this was in front of my friend who now felt guilty for going to the dog park. I tried to tell him to calm down because when we took Sugar he was already lying down and not at risk of getting hurt and we were going to be back very soon.

While unpacking her things, she mentioned that she still needed to bring a pile of “old” clothes to the donation center.

When he died a few years ago, she had to go back to work the next week. Her sister had the month off, so she took what she wanted and donated everything else in his house. Apparently, the sweaters were the only things she got besides an envelope of post cards that her sister got rid of.Now she is barely speaking to me and said I was an AH for getting rid of her stuff without asking. I understand that they were important to her but I feel like she’s being kind of dramatic. I told her this morning and she hasn’t gotten out of bed and has been staring at the wall ever since.

	"body" : "So for a bit of context I (29M) have a younger brother, Julian (27M) and we grew up very Christian. Both of us are now no longer practicing but our parents and majority of the extended family are still devout Christians. This explains why Julian married his now Ex wife, Nora (27F) when they were 19 especially since she was also a very conservative Christian woman. Needless to say it was mostly due to both of their  parents pressure for them to marry at such a young age. They ended about 2 years ago and left on good terms. They both work at the same company but the office is quite large and they work in different departments so it’s not a problem.About a month ago, Julian confessed that he was bi and had known since he was 14. Apparently he experimented in high school secretly but was too scared to let anyone know. He said he was going through a lot at the time and could not handle the stress of figuring out himself and so he just repressed it and basically gaslit himself into thinking he was straight. It wasn’t until recently that he met someone (his now bf) that he finally took the time to work through his identity and be happy with himself.I love my brother no matter what and will always be there for him and this does not change anything between us. Our family taking this news badly was to be expected but apparently our parents let it spill to Nora’s parents (they are still friends btw) and she found out from there. She reacted horribly. She said she felt violated and disgusted that a “sinner” and “homosexual” had been intimate with her and that if she had know they would never have been married. She ended up outing him to her co-workers and in about 24h the entire office knew.This past weekend, Julian called me crying about this issue and looked to vent about it. I let him know that she was 100% wrong for outing her but I thought that even though what she said about him was unkind she had a right to feel that way. Julian was upset by this, hung up saying “thought out of everyone in the family you would be the one to stand by me” and hasn’t spoken to me since.

AITA?EDIT: i am so thankful and appreciative of all the replies i got here, we have since had a long much needed discussion after i showed him some of the best replies i got on here. he apologized we talked about underlying issues, because we all know this isnt just about the toilet seat, and we actually worked a lot of stuff out that needed to be talked about. everything feels right. ive tried to reply to everyone and tell everyone i appreciate their insight but there are a lot of people so im sorry if i didnt reply to you. i appreciate almost every reply here and i red every one of them :) to make a few things clear, i have a squatty potty that sticks out A LOT and makes it so i have to lean against the back wall and use my other hand to pull the seat down and that breaks the concentration i need to not pee myself. another thing i saw is people just outright saying i have a horrible boyfriend, which i appreciate the concern, but i can guarantee to everyone he is amazing and he has flaws like everyone else, and is working on himself like you and i. i dont appreciate comments just telling me to leave him and hes a horrible human being because i dont think its fair to judge someone off a single reddit post, i needed advice on a single specific argument we were having, negativity about my boyfriend, or our ages, are not welcome here and i wont be giving those people the time of day anymore. if you were just concerned, i appreciate you.",

I’ll try to present the facts as objectively as possible and be open to any and all judgment. TIA!A little background: I recently gave birth to my awesome newborn (3W/M), Liam. He’s only a few weeks old, though the process of caring for a newborn has been EX-HAUS-TING, as I’m sure many of you may know. On the other hand, I also have a flat-out stellar older son (3M), Nicholas, who is naturally curious and loves exploring the world around him.Now, to the incident that caused the controversy.A few days ago, I was changing Liam’s diaper when Nicholas came into the room. He looked intrigued by his baby brother’s umbilical cord stump, which had recently fallen off. Instead of panicking or scolding him, though, I decided to use it as an opportunity to teach him about childbirth, the human body, and the miracle of life. I explained to him in simple terms what the umbilical cord was, and why it’s important for babies.Nicholas was fascinated and, therefore, asked if he could touch it. I hesitated for a moment, but ultimately allowed him to explore it gently (under my supervision, of course!). I made sure his hands were clean, and emphasized the importance of being gentle and careful. His reaction was pure joy and curiosity, causing him to excite even more about his baby brother.However, when my family found out about said incident, they were appalled and accused me of being irresponsible/unhygienic. They argued that I should have immediately disposed of the umbilical cord stump and not let Nicholas near it, as it could be unclean/potentially harmful. They also believe that I put both Nicholas and Liam at risk by allowing the above interaction to occur.I understand their concerns, though I do still genuinely believe that it was an educational moment for Nicholas and an opportunity to strengthen the bond between him and Liam. I took all necessary precautions (well, as far as I’m aware) to ensure cleanliness and safety. I also consulted with Dr. Google (who, well; alright), who assured me that—as long as proper hygiene was maintained—no significant risk was involved.So, Reddit—AITA? Was I negligent and unhygienic, or did I make the right decision to turn it into a teachable moment? I’m 100% open (and grateful!) to all judgment and advice. TIA!",

So, the issue revolves around me, my odd snack habit, and a labeled bag of Cheetos Puffs.I'll start by admitting I have a unique way of enjoying my Cheetos Puffs. They're 100% my favorite snack food. It might seem strange to some, but I've been doing this for years and it's simply how I like them best. I like to suck on them until they get soft and then I spit them back into a bag. I've done this since I was a kid and despite the looks I get, it's my own little comfort ritual. I understand it may seem gross to some, but I want to emphasize that I ALWAYS keep my soggy Cheetos separate from other snacks in the house.I use a particular bag clearly labeled \"Mama's Bag\" in bold, large letters. This bag stays in the pantry, separate from the rest of the food, so as not to confuse or upset anyone. My boys and hubby know to stay away from this bag as it's mine.The incident happened yesterday when my brother in law, who's been staying with us for 3 weeks now, decided to dig into my labeled bag without asking me first. He was horrified when he dipped his hand in only to find soggy, sucked-down cheetos.. He immediately spit it out, and came storming into my room, accusing me of ruining his appetite and demanding that I throw away my 'disgusting' bag. He called me an asshole for keeping such a 'gross' bag in the kitchen where anyone could stumble upon it.Now, I get that expecting some cheetohs puffs and getting a soggy, sucked down cheetoh is disappointing, especially if you're not expecting it. However, I feel that my bag was clearly labeled and separated for a reason. It's my personal snack and I never implied or suggested that anyone else should eat from it. I've been doing this for years and no one has ever had an issue with it save for my husband, once, who quickly got over it.I apologized for his unpleasant experience, but refused to throw away my personal stash.

I live in student accommodation with 5 other people (4F 1M).At the beginning of the year we all went on nights out together, hung out on campus together and became quite good friends. Early into the first semester (about 4-5 weeks) the other guy in my flat (\"Jim\") became increasingly worried about work and effectively stopped hanging out with us, wanting to spend the time revising instead. About the same time I noticed that the 4 girls in my flat started asking me whether I wanted to do stuff with them less (from maybe 1-2 a week to 2-3 times a month). I originally thought this was because they were also putting more focus on their work and I was totally fine with it, even though it felt like we were drifting apart a bit. Things stayed the same until about 2 weeks ago when I was talking to Jim and he asked me why I wasn't out with everyone else. I asked him what he meant and he said that everyone else in the flat had gone out to a bar together \"like they usually do every thursday\".Apparently the rest of my flatmates had been going out and doing stuff that we used to do together as a group without me since more or less the beginning of the academic year and effectively \"replaced\" me with a group of their own friends.When the group got back from the park I met them in our shared kitchen and explained that if they had a reason why didn't want me to be a part of the group or (for whatever reason) felt uncomfortable hanging out with me they should have just said and I would have understood, but at the moment it felt like I was being intentionally left out for no reason. One of them was sympathetic and apologised, saying that she thought I already knew that they wanted their group to be a \"girls thing\" and so hadn't mentioned it. Unfortunately the others got agitated and said that they didn't need to go out of go out of their way to tell me I wasn't being invited to things and that I should have worked it out on my own and moved on rather than confronting them about it.Things have been a little bit rough in the flat since but I'm wondering whether I was justified in being upset here, AITA?EDIT: a lot of people have been making judgement about how I talked to my flatmates by my use of the word \"confront\". What happened was that I waited in our shared kitchen when they got back and asked them if I could have a conversation about being left out of the group and that I wanted to understand what reason they had or if I'd said something that made them uncomfortable/not want to hang out with me anymore. At no point did I raise my voice and I was actually pretty uncomfortable throughout the whole thing (avoiding eye contact, trying to word things in a nice way etc). The flatmates that got agitated (as far as I can tell) did so because they thought I was saying they were being unfair, rather than because of how I talked to them about it.",

I'm ashamed of my past and am no longer a part of that community.I'm in a friend circle of many people and sometimes people go in and out of it. One guy in particular I'm close to (call him Shane) and Shane helps me a lot with my autism and corrects me often. But Shane, along with all the other girls and some of the guys even, call me sexist a lot. There are two main reasons for this.The first reason is because they told me that I never thank or acknowledge women outright for trying to help me, and thank Shane instead. Like for example they got mad at me because a girl tried to make some anime recommendations and I tried to ask Shane for his opinion instead. And another time another girl tried to give me advice on an RL problem and I thanked Shane instead.Today things got even more sour. We were talking about past people we had in our friend circle and I was able to list the names of 10 people we had over the years. Shane and the girls pointed out that they were all men and that I ignored to list any women. I was able to list a couple of them after some hints so I don't see the big deal.After today it's gotten to the point where they want to remove me from the friend circle because of my supposed \"sexism\" but I don't see the issue to be honest.AITA?",

She has fortnite figurines at her desk. My 11 yr old plays these games, and we know she doesn't have kids.  She does completely oddball things like randomly spin in her chair and make corny jokes no one finds funny. She's always the butt of everyone's jokes in the office, but no one is really bullying her. Other than that she doesn't really talk to the other employees at work. I prefer not to get into office drama because at the end of the day, I'm only in the office for the paycheck.I and a couple of other coworkers found her in the bathrooms having full blown conversations with herself in one of the big stalls. She was the only one in the stalls. It's like husband and wife conversation but it's just one woman. I found it to be super creepy, and when she came out and saw me, it was like she saw a ghost. I asked her if she's ok, and she got defensive and said yes. The other women in the back was laughing at her but i ignored it and told her, we all heard you talk to yourself and that's kind of weird, and  really creepy. It's not normal. Are you sure you don't need help?\"It was then she raised her voice at me and say no and to leave her alone, before she ran out. My coworkers were laughing harder before they left too.I was trying to see if I could help her since a friend of mine is a good therapist. I wasn't trying to call her crazy, but I assumed she was in some sort of trouble, and I didn't want people to get the wrong idea that she's crazy. I wasn't trying to bully her or anything.

I'm supportive of his hobby but I do wish he would be more realistic. He's too tall and heavy to ride despite his attempts to stay as lean as possible and it's only going to get worse as he gets older.Anyway, this week there was a local horse show (not a rodeo necessarily, but I call it that for convenience) and Xavier of course wanted to go. It fell on a school day so I told him he could go as long as he got good grades for the week, was able to arrange the day off from his jobs, and finished his homework before he went out.If he was able to do all that, I'd cook him an early dinner so he could go at 5:30 and that I'd drive him out there. Well, Xavier did do everything I asked, but when I tried calling him down for dinner he didn't come. When I checked on him I saw he'd fallen asleep. Now my son doesn't sleep that often or that well, so I decided to leave him alone. By the time he woke up it was two hours after the rodeo.He couldn't believe I'd let him miss it and he was so upset I told him a little white lie: I'd tried to wake him but I couldn't. After that he was still exasperated but more at himself. I told him look at the bright side, at least he didn't have to eat dinner.I feel kind of bad, though because in a way it is my fault that he missed something he'd have enjoyed, and if I hadn't lied he'd still be mad at me.

	"title" : "AITA for \"Driving My Parents into a Corner\"",
	"body" : "Facts:On Tuesday, I (18M) asked my parents if I could drive to visit my girlfriend (18F) who lives an hour away. We had already agreed that I could drive on my own in their cars, with prior notice and their permission. They said no, but I could work something out with my girlfriend to meet her halfway and hang out with her at my house on Friday. I said OK and began planning.On Wednesday, my mom asked me what my plans were for Friday, and I said I wasn't sure.On Friday morning, I woke up early to check the weather and eat breakfast before driving out. My parents were woken up and came to the kitchen very grumpy with me. They asked what I was doing, and I told them I wanted the keys so I could pick up my girlfriend. They said that although Tuesday they had offered to let me drive, they didn't think I accepted. I apologized for the misunderstanding, and then asked them if now I could have the keys (I was already running a little late). They said they would consider letting me go in the afternoon.I asked them if they needed to use the cars, and it turned out one of them would be free all morning (and I only needed it for an hour). However, I was still not allowed to go in the morning (and when they \"consider\" something, there's zero promise of it happening). I got a little angry and asked why, to which they replied \"our cars, our rules.\" Frustrated, I started videoing them and asking for a further explanation, after which they became aggressive and yelled at me that they couldn't give me everything I wanted, so I should leave them alone.My parents' side:They don't think they owe me an explanation for rules like \"you have to wait until the afternoon\" and got defensive when I asked for one. They claim I \"backed them into a corner\" by videoing.My side:I go to a different college than my girlfriend, so winter break was my only chance to visit her frequently. On Friday morning, I took responsibility for the misunderstanding but still asked to go because they'd offered on Tuesday, plans didn't conflict, and seeing my girlfriend meant a lot to me (I rarely got to, and this was my last chance for a while). When they refused without an explanation, I was frustrated and videoed to record what they were saying (in case they denied it later).Summary:I understand that my parents have the legal right to prevent me from driving, whenever they want. However, I think it was inconsiderate and unfair of them to deny me this time, as they wouldn't provide a reason and they didn't care that my girlfriend's family had to go out of their way for nothing. I didn't get to see my girlfriend, and I'm writing this from my college dorm. So, AITA?EDIT:Many people are concerned about me videoing, which I appreciate the feedback on. For more context, my parents have recorded me during past arguments; I didn't realize this was a big deal. Also, they have done hurtful things to me, pretending it never happened, so I wanted evidence.",

Now his mom cut contact with me as i refused to give her money so she could buy drugs with but i kept in contact with my nephew as he is a good and responsible kid sending him money, talking to him making sure he is ok emotionally and physically.Now i couldnt really go visit him as  running my businesses takes up a huge part of my day  and they lived 4600 miles away but i tried my best to keep in contact, when i found out my sister had died last year  i couldnt leave the kid there all alone so he stayed with my parents for a bit of time till we could get our paperwork situated and he could come here my wife  now loves this kid like he is her own (she is not fertile and we could never have kids)Now onto the actual story, im very passionate about cars and have a decently large car collection, and marcelo is also a big car nerd like i am so i thought it would make a nice birthday gift to take him on track and let him drive one of my cars but i didnt discus it with my wife and i kept it as a surprise for marcelo till his birthday.This is where i might be the asshole. On his birthday i just told him to pick out any car that he likes and that we would take it to the track that i had rented for the day, well the kid picked out my gtr which is my most powerful car i was a bit worried about letting him drive it on the track as it pushes 1400 horsepower  and its just a scary car to let a 17 year old drive but i went along with it, i did a few demonstrating laps to show him how to work aroudn the track, when to speed up and slow down, how to take corners  without crashing etc well on  the track  i did a few laps with him driving and me in passanger seat so he could get used to the track he did great showed good control over the car so  then we decided to take my amg gt in the track and just race for a little  (we were towing the gtr and the  gt  as they are both tuned and arent street legal) now as we raced we were both competative and we went  much faster then we should have (him reaching speeds of 215 mph and me at just around 200) i should also mention that he doesnt have a drivers license but i have taught him how to drive allthough it was normal cars not supercars.Well when we went home he went and told my wife about all t happened ( she didnt know i was gonna  take him to the track) now my wife was calling me an idiot, reckless and  said \" are you trying to get  him killed he is my only son\"  which  hurt quite a bit as i love this kid, my wife isnt talking to me an it has been 4 days.So reddit AITA for letting my son drive on trackEDIT: for anyone wondering  i maintain my cars well and always  go to my mechanic and get them thoroughly checked before im gonna go on track, especially my tuned carsUPDATE: So a few hours ago i talked to my wife, apologised and wanted to understand her more well she showed me a video  of the gtr nismo crash that happened at the Nurburgring back in 2015 and said \" I dont think i would have been so hurt if you had taken any of the other cars its just that i saw that crash about an hour before i saw you  parking the cars and marcelo telling me what happened\" then she  told me she  wants me to sell it as everytime she sees it she remembers that crash and  is scared something else will happen which led to another argument as other then my 765lt this is my favorite car, which i also dont get to drive that much so i really dont wanna see it go.

I just recently finished up exams, so for the past few weeks, I have obviously been working my arse off and was under quite a lot of stress.I’m living at my brother (42M) and his wife’s (41F) house, with their 4 year old daughter (we’ll call her Emily). My brother and his wife both work full time jobs, so it can be a struggle for them to find time in the day to spend with Emily. Up until November, they’d had a full-time nanny/caretaker for her, but the caretaker recently had a child herself, and is currently on some sort of maternity-leave.My brother decided to reach out to our cousin (17F. We’ll call her Hannah), who lives in America— to see if she would be interested in coming to nanny Emily for the next few months, and in exchange for this she would be given free food, a room to sleep in, and get to experience life in a different country. She agreed, and has now been living here caring for Emily since the end of November.Hannah is very mature for her age, and when I have free time, we often cook, talk, and spend time together. We’ve grown quite close. Recently however, Hannah has not been as talkative and outgoing when speaking to me. Rather than spending her free time hanging out with me like she usually does, she’s been locking herself in her room more, and withdrawing herself from everyone.I finally confronted her a few days ago and asked her if something was wrong, to which she only said that she was tired? I didn’t really believe her, so I continued to keep asking her for the next few days. Yesterday though, she changed her answer about being “tired” and told me that she’s been feeling stressed recently. I asked her why she was stressed, as her schedule is easy (just feeding and spending time with Emily), so she doesn’t have any reason to feel stressed. She couldn’t give me a straight answer though, and just kept saying that she didn’t know why she was feeling so stressed, which literally makes no sense?? She even said that she “couldn’t fall asleep” anymore because she was constantly feeling anxious.I told her that she’s obviously never felt real stress then, and that she needs to grow up. She’s obviously never experienced ACTUAL anxiety, and I told her that if she wants to experience it, then she should try attending law school and it would humble her real quickly.Today, Hannah’s mum called me and told me that Hannah had called her last night, distraught, and is now begging to go home to America. She accused me of bullying her daughter, and said that what I had told Hannah yesterday was too far, which is fucking ridiculous. She’s mad that I told Hannah that she has no reason to be stressed?Hannah is flying back to the states in a few days now, and my brother is upset with me because he has to hire a nanny now. Frankly, I don’t see how what I said was too far, and it’s upsetting to me that everyone is turning against me for something so minuscule. AITA???",

I Don't smoke, never have, and i don't want to be with someone that smokes. From our second date I've let him know that i don't like it, but i couldn't do anything about it as we weren't even official yet. A few months into our relationship i told him that i don't  want him to smoke regularly, as it's unhealthy, and something bad always happens. It was going back and forth, i did some research and noticed it was not allowed in our religion either. After me stating that it's my preference and him stating that it's a part of him, i said that i just don't wanna be with someone that needs to smoke to have more fun. After some discussing, he agreed.He broke our agreement, as he kept smoking. After an argument he promised to fully stop smoking. About a month later, that dumb*ss sent me a video of him, petting a cat, and forgetting that he had a big roll of  in his hand. I found out that he has been lying to me all the time about this and he had been smoking. Long story short, after a lot of making up, he has now stopped completely (i believe).Now for the issue, he doesn't like the way i dress. I have a certain style, and it's really not that bad i believe. I don't wear crop tops with mini skirts all the time or go out with inappropriate chlothes. He doesn't like me showing any skin or wearing tight chlothes like leggings. F.e. i was wearing a hoodie and flarepants, and he thought it was too much (the pants).Thing is, on our first date, he told me my outfit was perfect, not too revealing but also not too covered up (in his words). It was summer and i was wearing flare pants and a tank top. He also asked me at the start of our relationship, if i would want to cover up more if we were meeting his family. He said you can dress how you want to dress normally, but his family is a little conservative so for a good impression, dress a little modestly. I agreed and understood because my family is the same way. When he asked me to be his girlfriend i was wearing a bright, tight red dress.For all these reasons, i think he gave me the impression that he was okay with how i dress. I didn't give him that impression with smoking though. He thinks i should make a sacrifice too, but I think this is not necessary as I'm not even really wearing skimpy clothes ( in my opinion).

Typically, my SO comes in, says hi to my roommates or my roommates say hi to my SO, and we go up to my room to watch a movie or fool around, etc. My SO also knows about half of the extended friend group by name, and they're all friendly, although my SO is not super sociable, but more introverted.Yesterday was a Halloween party with some of my friends at my house, and I also had a date with my SO - we got dinner and came back to my place. We both knew this party would be going on in the living room/outdoor patio, it was quite small (10-12 people), but the plan was to watch a movie in my room and relax after the long workweek. There were a couple of people who I had not seen in a few months, and they seemed to be having a blast, so I asked my SO if it's okay that I sit down for a beer with them. We played a drinking game for a bit and chatted in the outdoor patio seating, while my SO was standing awkwardly on their phone and didn't join us. Because of this, even though I was having fun, I left the party between 10-20 minutes after joining, and we went up to my room.My SO was a bit colder and quieter than usual, but I didn't think much of it. However I asked them at the end of the night if anything was wrong, because you never know and communication is key. My SO said that I \"left them\" for my friends and had a really shitty attitude because I saw them standing alone but didn't invite them to join the circle of conversation/beers. That was really confusing for me because:In the past, I've made efforts to include my SO in my socializing, but they usually refuse politelyMy SO knows most of the people from last night, and they were friendly to my SO, so I assumed they'd be comfortable hanging togetherMy SO is an adult, they don't need an invitation to join a group interaction that's literally 2 feet from them?So, AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA For Asking My Mom Not To Sell My Childhood Violin After She Wouldn’t Give Me A Cut Of The Profits?",
	"body" : "First and foremost I apologize if the story is all over the place because I’m still very emotional.I, 21F have always been a musician ever since I was a little girl. The first instrument I played was the violin. I had gotten my first violin, a quarter size, from somebody who didn’t play anymore but eventually I outgrew it then came a beautiful blue, half size violin that I would play all the time. I eventually lost interest as I wasn’t very good at the violin, and whenever I would try to play, my parents would make comments like “that was terrible!” Admittedly, I didn’t practice much, but that was because I didn’t want those comments.Now onto the story, I recently saw that my mother had posted on Facebook that she was selling the violin. She didn’t tell me anything I felt a little hurt, because I still have many photos of myself with that violin when I was a little girl I messaged her asking her for a cut of it and she asked if I bought it , I said no but I was a child at the time. I then asked her if I could be the one to sell it instead since I was the one that used it and she Asked why I needed the money so badly for context my boyfriend and I live paycheck to paycheck in an apartment since we’re both asked why I needed the money so badly for context my boyfriend and I live paycheck to paycheck in an apartment since we’re both college students. She then said that she already had a buyer that’s when I felt very hurt.I know I would probably never play it again, but there were some sentimental value with that violin and she was willing to sell it without telling me I begged her not to sell it, and she got very hostile with me.She said that I would never play it again and that she needed the money. So AITA?Edit: I’ll say what I should’ve said in the post. (I can’t word things right)I never wanted it to be sold in the first place. I wanted a cut of the profits because I felt like I was being forced to give it up. I probably wasn’t gonna sell it if I had gotten my hands on it if I am being honest. I wouldn’t be able to let it go. I guess I mainly asked for myself to sell it so I could keep it and maybe let it go when I felt ready.So I really don’t care about the money I’d get from selling it. I guess I just didn’t want my mom just selling it and keeping the money for herself when she didn’t even ask me.Also for those asking: I loved playing it. What stopped me from being interested was the constant discouragement I had gotten. But I loved performing with it more than you’d know.Edit 2: I’m gonna make this clear. I DID NOT PLAN TO SELL IT. I asked her if I could sell it so she would give it to me. I never wanted it to leave the family in the first place.",

It was heartbreaking to see someone so young going through all of that.Given the closeness between Hope and myself, I had assured her that if anything ever happened to her, I would take her in without hesitation. I have a lot of love for Hope and my family and I took her on trips to places like Disneyland. However, when Hope turned 18 and her father kicked her out of the house, she came over to my house with all her things, expecting me to fulfil the promise I had made her years ago.As much as I hated to do it, I had to say no. I explained that I couldn't take her in right at that moment and apologized for letting her down. Nonetheless, Hope became very upset with me and called me a liar. I felt terrible for breaking my promise, but I truly wasn't expecting things to transpire like they did.Afterwards, I spoke to my family about it and they told me that I shouldn't have made promises that I couldn't keep. They had a point, and I began to feel even worse for letting Hope down. Then, to make matters even more complicated, I got a call from Dale.

	"body" : "My boyfriend (26M) and I (22F) began dating about 5 weeks ago. I'll admit we have moved pretty quickly. We take turns sleeping over at the others house almost every day, we have had conversations about what it would be like if we were to get married or have a kid together. Basically,  things have been going really really well between us! The only thing that has been an issue is his tendency to overshare. I like that he's super open but sometimes he gives too much details. For example, he has told me how his exs prefer to be fucked. I've told him I don't like hearing in depth stories about his ex and if anything it makes me feel iffy about him. He has definitely worked on this since we had that talk until today. We stopped by my moms house as we passed by her street today. She was baby sitting my 5m ond niece and my boyfriend met her for the first time.  I genuinely feel like my niece is the cutest baby alive and he knows I ADORE HER. I talk about her all the time, buy her cute things when I go to the store etc. As we got in the car to leave I asked \"so what did you think of my baby.\" He laughed. I expected a response like \"She's cute but our babies would be cuter\" or something else cheesy. I asked \"what's so funny?\" He responded \"oh its nothing. It doesn't involve us at all?\" I looked at him in confusion for about 5 seconds when he says \"that's the ugliest baby I ever seen.\" That was about 30 minutes ago. I gave him the silent treatment the whole ride home and told him I am going to sleep at home tonight instead of at his place. He tried cheering me up by kissing me, telling me jokes, etc. He apologized several times but I don't know how to move forward. Am I wrong for being upset? What would you do in my situation? For clarity,  yes I am upset that he called her ugly because the baby is FAR from ugly. The actual issue is that he actually said it despite knowing how rude comments like that are.",

No phones, no smart watches, no pagers. I've been working here for about 6 months so my wife knows this and understands that she should not try to contact me by my cell at work. Phones are dropped off in our lockers and I typically have mine on Do Not Disturb. Before this incident, my phone has never gone off in the locker before.Recently there was a pretty big fire at a secondary worksite that I do work at occasionally but that day I was working at the main building. Local news covered the fire before I found out about it because again no electronics, plus the work we do isolates us a bit so news travels pretty slowly. There were a few casualties, a lot of seriously injured folk.My wife had been watching the news from home and started freaking out, I guess. She called me 20 freaking times, which (and I did not know this was possible) overrode my DND and my phone was ringing for a while in my locker. In the middle of my shift, I got called into my managers office and was chewed out (and written up) for my phone making so much noise. They told me to go take care of whatever it was making my phone go off before I went back to work.I won't lie...when I saw those 20 missed calls from my wife I was seriously pissed off. Like I said, she knows not to try to contact me directly and a citation hurt my chances of getting a raise or promotion. I called her back and she was sobbing and asking me if I was okay. I said of course I was okay and asked what the f*ck was wrong with her to call me so many times. She was still crying and started talking about the fire. After that I started half-yelling at her about all the reasons it was dumb of her to call me.When I got home she was super upset with me. I apologized for yelling but she refused to talk. She's been very chilly the past few days and sleeping in our daughter's room. I know it was not the best decision to yell at her but I still think my anger justified . 1) she knows I don't work in the secondary worksite very often. 2) she knows that I can't be contacted directly and she could have just called the office. 3) 20 calls is absolutely *insane*.

We all know him well and I have always got along with him. He comes from a rough background but he has always been very polite and charming. He doesn't talk about his own family or about his upbringing. My sister said it's a painful topic for him so no one ever pushed.There was recently a family event which FBIL attended. He was quiet during the day (he is normally high-energy and sociable) then disappeared for a while. When I went outside for some fresh air I bumped into him. He was emotional and said it was a hard day for him due to negative associations. He ended up offloading some quite shocking things from his past including that he has a history of very serious drug use (including needles) and that he has done sex work and p**n (men and women). I felt for him at the time because he was so upset (literally crying on my shoulder) but afterwards I felt more and more uncomfortable. I still feel bad for him since he clearly regrets it but it's very shocking to find out he has that kind of history and it does make me feel differently about him.Obviously I told my husband what FBIL told me because I didn't feel comfortable keeping it to myself. I also told my sister because I didn't know how honest he had been with her and it could impact on her decision to marry him. She was angry and said she was fully aware and it doesn't make her think less of him. I know others might disagree but I decided if my sister and FBIL weren't going to bring it up then it was my responsibility to make sure my family had the information they needed to make an informed choice about what kind of relationship they have with him. My parents agreed that it was the right thing to do and were grateful. My brother said he could see my point but didn't think it was my responsibility to share that information. My brother's wife thought I was out of line.When my sister found out I told our family about FBIL's sketchy past, she was very angry. She is now refusing to speak to me altogether because apparently this has affected FBIL quite badly. They are no longer engaged because \"he thinks he's not good enough for her\" and no one in my family has seen him since all of this happened. Obviously that wasn't my intention and no one said \"he isn't good enough\". I think it's naive to pretend that you see someone exactly the same way after finding out they're an addict, whether you like it or not there are risks that come with that lifestyle and relapses are common. I'm concerned that my sister will get hurt and I don't think it's unreasonable for my family to have access to the same information I do, especially when they're inviting him to their homes and there are children around etc.AITA for informing my family about FBIL's background?",

She has terrible separation anxiety, and a poor sense of boundaries. Like, she’ll stay up and out all night with friends even when she has work the next day b/c she doesn’t like saying goodnight to them, or ending the good times. She also gets very drunk when she’s out. This isn’t an issue in itself - she doesn’t endanger herself or anyone else. But she’s told me that her go-to remedy when she’s down is to drink and that worries me. I wish she had healthier ways to cope.I asked her if she shares any of this with her intimate friends, so they’re aware and can look out for warning signs. Her response was that she doesn’t want to ruin the vibes or be seen as weak or be a burden.So I didn’t really see what else I could do aside from having a group call with them all explaining things as plainly as possible without divulging too much of her private issues. I didn’t really tell them explicitly to avoid her, but more to not enable her.  So like for example I said “if she calls you for a night out, maybe suggest a non-boozy outing.” “If she’s a little pushy, don’t be afraid to tell her no”. Some of them took that as an instruction to not spend time with her at all, which obviously took a huge toll on her emotionally.And then eventually , she found out what I’d asked. I don’t exactly know how but my guess is my wife laid the guilt on pretty thick with one of our friends and then it came out.She’s very angry. Was I wrong? I really only wanted what was best for her without trying to infantilize her. Maybe I should have organized a proper intervention. Idk.Yes, she has a therapist she’s been seeing for years.

He doesn't handle sudden changes in plans very well. I've learned to give him as much notice as possible, but sometimes these things are unavoidable. The good news is that David hasn't had a meltdown in public in a very long time.My husband's parents are in town for a short visit. They always treat us to dinner when they’re here. For the past few years we’ve been going to Red Robin when they're here. David always orders the same thing; a plain cheeseburger, chicken strips, and a chocolate malted milkshake. I wish he would eat better, but I've given up trying to get him to try new foods. Nonetheless, I wish he would eat healthier.At Red Robin, the malts only come in one size. When you order one, they give you a second glass with extra malt. Now in the past, I've allowed David to have the extra glass, but I've always thought that this is too much sugar. I also wanted a malt, but didn’t want make my in-laws pay for another one because I didn’t want the whole thing. So, on the way over, I told David that I was going to have the extra malt. He asked me why, and I explained. He looked upset but I trusted him to not have a meltdown.We got to the restaurant and ordered our food. David asked me if I really was going to take his extra malt. I said yes. He asked me why I couldn't just order another malt for myself. I told him that I didn’t want to make my in-laws pay for another one. When our food arrived, I immediately took the extra malt and moved it so David couldn’t take it. David still looked upset but started eating, and I thought that once he had eaten he would be in a better mood.When David finished his food, he asked again if he could have the malt. I said no. He started crying. It wasn't his usual outburst, but he was still quite upset. I took him outside. I honestly thought that me telling him on the way was enough notice, and that he was mature enough to not have a meltdown in public. Some people walked by and stared at us and I began to feel embarrassed. Eventually he stopped crying, and we went back inside. At this point I didn't want the malt anymore, so I gave it to the waitress.When we got home, my MIL told me I handled this the wrong way, and that I should have told David about this several days in advance, and let him have the malt when he asked for it. I honestly wasn't expecting her to say this; my in-laws are very health conscious and have been trying for years to get David to eat better. My husband is on my side; he also had assumed David was mature enough to handle this without getting upset. I’m not sure what to think at this point.EDIT: It seems like the majority of people on here think I'm TA, and I accept it. All I can say is that getting David the help he needs has been an uphill battle. We have been referred to many so-called \"experts\" on autism, but honestly I don't think they know much more about it than my husband and I do. They seem to think that David needs strict routines because \"autistic people can't function without a routine\" and discipline. They tell us that in order for us to get David to improve his behavior, we need to make it known that we're the parents, he's the kid, and if he misbehaves, he must deal with the consequences. We do NOT agree with this approach.It has also been extremely difficult finding David the support he needs at school, hence why he's homeschooled for most of the day except for the couple of hours where he attends a special day class, which we have him attend so that he isn't isolated from his peers. This class is not the ideal environment for him as it's meant for kids with learning disabilities, which David doesn't have. His teachers and behavior specialists have told us that what David really needs help with at school is social skills. One of the \"experts\" we consulted with was a former therapist who had quit her practice in order to start a school for kids with Asperger's syndrome. We thought this was the ideal school for David, but after meeting her and seeing how she ran the school, we didn't think it would be a good fit for him. We are continuing our search for the right school for David; he needs to go to a school with small classes that have the same teacher for all subjects, as well as counselors on hand that he can talk to if he's having a hard time, but there really doesn't seem like there's a school that can meet his needs while at the same time not being overly restrictive.I would like to clear up a couple of things. First, the reason why I gave the malt to the waitress when we went back inside the restaurant is because by the time we got back inside it had melted. This is also the reason why I didn't want to order a second malt as the majority of it would have gone to waste. We wouldn't have been able to finish all of it, and I am not sure of the best way to store a milkshake/malt in the fridge so that it doesn't melt, but also doesn't freeze.In regards to my MIL, I was honestly taken aback by her telling me that I should have given David the extra malt when he asked for it. My in-laws (especially MIL) are very health conscious. They stress the importance of eating a balanced diet and not eating too much, along with regular exercise, limiting screen time, and not staying up too late. They also have somewhat of a \"tough it out\" approach to handling life's various challenges, and while they have been supportive of David's struggles associated with his autism, they nonetheless feel that his challenges can be overcome without resorting to seeing a psychiatrist and taking anti-anxiety/antidepressant meds (they aren't against it, but they nonetheless think that there are better ways to handle it). When we go over to their house, they always encourage David to try new foods. They were a lot stricter about this when he was younger, but my husband eventually told them to ease up on him a bit and not put so much pressure on him to eat better. They've listened somewhat but still seem troubled that David is such a picky eater. When we told them about ARFID, it didn't seem to change their views of David's eating habits all that much (we explained that it was an eating disorder, but my MIL said that if it is an eating disorder, that's all the more reason to encourage David to eat better). They aren't like this so much when they come visit us at our house. But in any case, I had (incorrectly) assumed that MIL would have backed me up when it came to the malt. I wanted David to not have so much sugar, I did want some myself but didn't think it was worth ordering a second malt, and I didn't expect David to react the way he did because we were in public, and we had company. I see now that this wasn't the right way to go about it.All I can say is that my husband and I are doing the best we can to be supportive of David when he's struggling, while at the same time teaching him that life isn't always fair, but we aren't perfect. We can do research and get advice from other people on how best to handle the things that David struggles with, but a lot of things we've learned through trial and error (this being one of them).",

	"body" : "I (32F) have been part of a writing circle for the past two years, the goal is to proofread what people have written, give critique and that sort of thing. About six months ago \"Abby\" (34f) joined the group and we hit it off, exchanged numbers and began texting a lot outside of meetings about our respective books. But there where a few things off, she'd leave out detail of the book and refer to her characters as Character A and B or the main character, love interest, best friend and whatnot. I didn't mind too much, maybe she wasn't sure on names or something. But she also never let me read the story and would only recap what was going on, giving enough context so that I could help her decide what direction her book could go in.After awhile I realized that she wasn't writing a book but fanfiction for a popular franchise. I really hate fanfiction, it rips off someone else's hard work, is lazy, and written y teenagers who can't write. Abby knows how I feel about fanfiction and when I confronted her told me she didn't want to tell me because she knew I'd react badly. She's not writing a proper book, she's ripping off someone else's hard work and benefiting from it, of course I'd react badly especially since she lied to me about it.She brought it up at the last club meeting and some other members mentioned how some fanfictions have become their own books and been very popular. They brought up After, Fifty Shades of Grey and City of Bones, all of which are badly written books and prove my point. They're popular, not well written but they all called me an asshole anyway and the leader said that Abby's still welcome at the club because all writing is writing and she's very passionate about her fanfiction like everyone else is about their books.AITA?",

	"body" : "So I (27F) passed my test in October. My husband (42M) has been driving for years. He recently got a newer car when the old one got scrapped with engine failure, and since then it's become like a child of his. He never used to be like this about cars, and I get that it's a newer car (an electric) on finance too, but it's really annoying me. Before he got the new car I suggested he get an automatic (I learnt auto), rather than a manual like usual so then once I passed my test he could put me on it, and then I'd pay half the insurance and contribute toward the car 50/50, and then we would car share. Now, I understand that car share might not be practical and it probably would be better to have my own car, but at the minute I'm worried I'm going to forget how to drive, and it's more the principle than anything that he won't put me on the car even to just drive it to a shop just to stay in the headspace of driving. When I passed he said he didn't want to put me on the car and that he only got an automatic because all electrics are automatically automatic and he wanted an electric. I have paid for some car battery charges, since we drive a lot together, (and used to help with petrol too) but don't contribute at the minute to the repayments because the plan was it was \"his\" car until I could drive (and he doesn't expect me to pay for it) and then I'd happily pay my way. He says since he smashed his first car he doesn't really trust that I won't scratch it, and also just doesn't like the idea of sharing it. Personally I feel upset that he doesn't trust me. I also don't understand the logic of us both paying for cars when we are trying to save for a house mortgage. I get that practically I would probably prefer the independence of my own car, but purely on the basis temporarily until I get my own car it is frustrating me.

He offered to keep cleaning the kitchen and for a few weeks he did. Well since he started his job he hasn’t cleaned the kitchen once. He says that between work and cleaning he has no time to stream and that he’ll clean it soon. I am so tempted to just hide his gaming laptop and switch until he cleans the kitchen because I just don’t have the time to add one more area to my cleaning routine.

We have both dreamed of moving out of state for the entire time we’ve been together, and now we are in the stage of our life where we want to move forward with that.However, a few years ago, her mom suddenly developed epilepsy. She has severe seizures that leave her disoriented and unable to control her body. They happen every three months or so. When she has a seizure, she needs to be monitored and supervised for about a week afterwards because she has bouts of short term memory loss and is very confused. Not to mention she needs doctors appointments with head scans and sometimes stitches because the seizures usually involve falling. The painful part is that she is a perfectly healthy and mentally present middle aged woman most of the time, but someone needs to check on her daily in case she had a seizure.My girlfriend is an only child and her mother has never been married. The only family that can help are my girlfriends three aunts. The aunts claim they want to be the mother’s caretakers, and even go so far as to insist that my girlfriend is too young and not mature enough to be dealing with her mothers medical issues on her own. However, they are completely incompetent as caretakers. They don’t know any of her medical history or prescriptions, so they end up calling my girlfriend to ask for all that information every time a seizure happens and they take her to a hospital.At one point, they left the country on vacation and took the mother along with them. She had a seizure while left alone outside, and the mother was found on the street and brought to the hospital by a passing stranger. After this, they left her mother alone in the hotel room, completely disoriented, for the rest of the vacation. My girlfriend and I were appalled at this behavior and began rethinking the aunts’ responsibility as caretakers.My girlfriend is torn about what to do. On one hand, she wants freedom in her life to not be tied down at such a young age. But in the other hand, she feels guilty leaving her mother behind with sub-standard care. My stance is that her mother isn’t her responsibility, and if she takes on that responsibility now, she will never be able to live her own life. Similarly, her aunts’ belittling attitude towards her will always lead to frustrating relationship dynamics in the family.I am not making the decision for her at all, but when she asks for my opinion, I tell her that I dont think she has a reason to feel guilty for leaving. AITA for asking her to move away?Just a note to answer questions:Her mom is mentally capable most of the time. She doesn’t remember the seizures and how bad they are. Therefore she thinks she doesn’t need help. It makes it impossible to get a professional care team involved.The ideal solution would be for the mom to move with us but she won’t leave the house where she feels comfortable.",

A few months ago one of his cousins (23f) became pregnant and when he told me I was immediately mad and jealous. I cannot be happy for her to save my life and I do not want to be around her while she’s pregnant or when she has the baby I don’t want to meet or interact with it once it’s born. If she has a baby shower I don’t want to go and whenever she has cook outs I don’t want to go because I don’t want to ruin it for her. She should be able to enjoy this moment in her life without me taking it away from her. I feel like if I were to interact with her I’d be very rude unintentionally. She likes me and invites me to all of these gatherings but I feel like if I keep on not going she will notice my absence. I never got her number so there’s no way for us to communicate besides my bf which is fine with me.

I think the fact that she is having a baby when I can’t for many reasons is making me super mad and making me resent her. I sometimes wish bad things on her but I know I don’t actually mean it and im just jealous of her situation. When I expressed the fact that I don’t want to interact with his cousin anymore bc im mad and jealous at/of her he said he understands and he would be happy to have a child with me but I can’t avoid her for the rest of my life and I was saying that someone in his family should have a baby but I didn’t mean her when I was saying that and now I regret saying it out loud. I feel like I’m being a bad person by having these feelings and avoiding her for the rest of her life. It has come to the point that when my bf and I get married in a few years I don’t want her there or at least I don’t want her to be there with a child. If she is pregnant again when that happens I also don’t want her there but I know since she is super close to my bf I would have to have her there.

I tried not thinking about it but it always comes to mind and pisses me off. Any suggestions on what to do/AITA?I know it’s only been a few hours but I wanted to clarify a few things.I don’t have an issue with pregnant people or babies.I am looking into/for therapy.For those who are saying I’m immature you may be correct but I feel if I was truly immature I wouldn’t be asking Reddit or avoiding her id just do stupid shit and not care how this would affect my family.People I’m asking for advice on how to maneuver this weird ass situation while I’m looking for a therapist and I don’t want her to know bc I don’t want to hurt her feelings or harm the development of her fetus with stress or sadness that’s why I’m staying away.If you’d be kind in the comments that would be nice cause I’m not trying to kill her or anything I legit just am jealous of something for some reason that I cannot pinpoint.

Honestly, I have no idea what would happen if she told me she was into me too.So, WIBTA?",

When I first started dating my wife, she has always been messy and unclean. She doesn’t take care of her room that shares with her sister (f22), she doesn’t clean her clothes, she doesn’t brush her teeth, nor take a shower often. All she does is sit in her room and play games, only coming out when her mother arrives home to greet her. Just now I was about to shower and saw on the carpet that the cat has pooped. I went to their room and asked my youngest to clean it, but her sister came out instead. I asked for my youngest to clean it. So naturally I barged in her room and yelled at her for sending her sister to clean it. She yelled back saying I needed to specify who he was talking to because clearly me walking in wasn’t enough. She then started yelling because I barged in without knocking. This is my house and I can barge in any door I wish. I told her I shouldn’t have to specify who I’m talking to because she clearly heard my voice saying to clean it and should have gotten up and went, regardless if I wasn’t talking to her. I like to note, before I was with my wife, her children had came out of foster care. Their mother (my wife) were doping drugs and had to be taken. When I first came like I said in the beginning, she was unclean and never had any ability to take care of her stuff. My youngest is a brat from this act and I’m done with her attitude. I took her electronics and grounded her for 2 months for this selfish behavior.",

	"body" : "My friend recently got into a relationship with this girl. Back in august, we learned a bit more about her. She apparently went to the hospital for a car accident, and started sharing art. My friend group(besides the SO of the art thief) decided to start looking into things after a few things weren’t lining up. The friend said they and the girlfriend moved to Canada. This didn’t fully line up, as we heard a doorbell from the friend’s home back in the states after the claims of moving to Canada, and before people ask, we know it couldn’t be in the Canada home, as it was custom for the house back in the states because of the guy’s family. This, combined with other things, led to us investigating things.This led us down a rabbit hole of art that the friend’s girlfriend posted and claimed was hers, through reverse image searching, because we were concerned with the stories we were being told. Violence, break ins, attempted kidnappings, all in the span of a few weeks. That’s what we were being told by the girlfriend and our friend. Eventually, through contacting the friend’s mom, we had proof that Canada was a lie. Further more, I got a thought, that looking back, was wrong. I questioned if the girlfriend was real, due to the friend originally being in a relationship with someone else in the friend group, but they broke up a couple years ago.Now, this leads to recent history. We found the source of the art the girlfriend was posting. A small YouTuber. I went into this small youtuber’s discord and contacted them, along with one of the other friends. We had a talk earlier with the friend on the potentially stolen art. They said that the girlfriend was friends with the artist and had permission to post it. We asked the artist and got a response. The artist says they were not friends with our friend’s girlfriend and that they didn’t know each other.This builds further in a way of the girlfriend stealing works from the artist’s friends as well. We know because the artist showed up the original works with signatures. This is where the are we the assholes comes in. We talked further and the artist wanted to confront the girlfriend in the group chat. We agreed. We let the artist in and they confronted her. The girlfriend immediately left the group chat, and now the friend is pissed because according to them the girlfriend is having a mental breakdown. The friend says that we shouldn’t have handled it this way, while I’m over here wondering was there another option? Sorry if this is hard to read. I’m currently scatterbrained.

I hate bugs but I took them when she got sick. She has no energy or money to care for them and no one else in my family can help (money/disabilities)I want my partner to move in, she planned to move in months ago but the animals stopped her. There's a kitchen, bedroom, and small office. We both need to work from home, except the office is crammed full of tanks and neither of us can stand to be in there, and there isn't room to fit another desk in the kitchen. I can't afford to move.The dog. He's a delightful boy, but my partner has a dog. Her dog is a rescue, and while he's lovely, he absolutely cannot be around other dogs. We've tried introducing them, training classes, nothing has worked, it just wouldn't be safe to have them in the same home when her dog has issues that could end up with my sister's dog getting hurtSo... I've been selling the animals. A couple of my sister's bugs have died in the last year (I'm trying my best but I'm not the right person to care for them) and she freaked out when I told her so as I find new owners I haven't been telling her. I've told my family and they agree it's for the best as it could impact her recovery. I have been finding valuations for their setups etc and selling it all, the money is going to her (via family)The only remaining bug is a big snail who has become something of a palNow the dog. He's a 4 y o Labrador retriever, he's trained, friendly, so unsurprisingly it has been incredibly easy to find people desperate to adopt him (even locals who agreed to take him to visit her from time to time so it's not a total goodbye)I told my family what I was doing (last chance for any of them to take him) and... suddenly rehoming her animals is a horrific thing to do. Maybe it's the finality of it, maybe because it's a dogThey say I'm choosing my partner over my sister, that I should rehome my partner's dog instead, but honestly that's not the same thing. A young, healthy labrador gets snapped up, but a 10 y o mutt with diabetes and aggression issues will rot in a shelter cageNow I'm spiralling and wondering if I've done something horrendous, I can't get all the bugs back, I don't want them back, but have I just massively betrayed my sister, is letting her dog go a horrible thing to do?It got back to my sister that I was looking for new dog owners (she doesn't know about the bugs yet) and she had a breakdown, and has made it clear that she will not forgive meEdit for missed info, sorry: I have tried to discuss this with her many times, she shuts the conversation down and refuses to even discuss them being anywhere but with meI accept I'm the asshole, please tell me though what should I have done?

She has never been fully open to me about them, only telling me things when they’re so out of hand she no longer has control.

She calls me a few times a day on the verge of tears because her anxiety has gotten so bad it’s manifested as a physical feeling that she can’t control.

I trimmed another inch and showed him a photo. He again insisted on a very close shave. In the end I gave in and gave him what he asked for. I realized once the beard came off completely how different he looked and I started crying. He understood why I started crying and assured me his beard will grow back in 4 months. He looked completely different from the man I started shaving 30 minutes prior. Once I was done and he jumped in the shower I went into our guest room and cried for a bit.

My sister is being raised by the version who, due to health conditions, have realized their errors, and have given her everything I never got.My sister and I were talking about our childhoods when she mentioned possibly being able to move out since she feels as though she can't live with our grandparents anymore. When I asked why, it was because she felt as though our grandparents made her do everything for everyone and also because she was being called different queer slurs (jokingly and not) by her peers, and sometimes family members. I understood the frustration and told her that being openly queer is very hard to be okay with when living in a small town, and that it was harder when your family wasn't supportive. I also told her that she may not be allowed to move out, since my grandparents don't feel comfortable with the person she's wanting to move in with.She got angry with me and told me that I couldn’t understand what she was going through, and to stop trying to make her not move. I was caught off guard and told her that I wasn't trying to do that at all, I was trying to help her see reason since if told no, then that would be okay, too.

I told her that I can't help but wish I had her chances growing up.I ended the conversation by telling her that I loved her and that I'm happy she was living the life I wished I had growing up.

He says he does it because it was mom's dream to see the world before she had her family but I always felt like it is more about him rubbing his wealth in our faces and that's just an excuse. Our family was poor growing up, but he was very smart and managed to get a job straight out of college and climbed the corporate ladder extremely quickly. So now he has a ridiculous income that he is always flaunting. He is always offering to pay for something or loaning money to our family membersand it feels to me like he wants to hold the money he offers over people's heads so they can't disagree with him and make them feel obligated to come on these trips.Somehow, nobody but me sees how manipulative this whole situation is.This year he took  us to Moldova and my family was very excited but at arrival I found that instead of getting us a suite with two beds so my daughter could be supervised, he was planning to give her a seperate room. Without discussing it with me he decided to try and parent my daughter and I told him he was hugely overstepping to think he could give my 16 year old a room of her own and that I don't know what he was thinking to go over my head like that. He said that he felt like she was old enough and didn't realize it would be a problem but he didn't apologize so I told him that I was leaving if he didn't Apologize for what he had done. He didn't so I made my wife and daughter leave with me.My wife and daughter think that I was being selfish and are angry at me for ending their vacation. They don't understand that I was just trying to protect our family from the overreaching arms of my brother. But I feel unsure of it now that time has passed and I do wish we could have enjoyed the vacation as these family vacations are usually the only ones we get. So I ask you reddit, was I wrong for standing up to my brother?Edit: I realize that NONE of you are taking my daughter's safety into consideration. A young girl in a foreign country on her own is in no way appropriate. If I'm the A for CARING about my daughter then that's fine I'll be the A",

She usually stays in the room majority of the day and if not she’s working or going to class, as am I. However the first time I bring my boyfriend over so that he could see my room she had this intense aura like she was glaring us down. We wouldn’t be too much on the PDA, especially if my roommate is around.Though the second time she had a issue she claimed that my boyfriend didn’t have any boundaries since he came into the room without knocking (context: our AC broke and she left the door WIDE open while I had protested against it) and he didn’t knock even though I waved him in when he stopped by. The third issue was him spending the night (which was an accident due to it being 1am and his roommate wanted the room last minute). Then she got mad that I had brought him over again during visitation ours and thats when all hell breaks lose. I also want make it clear I texted her every time before I came to the room when my boyfriend was coming per our roommate agreement.She starts freaking out because she didn’t see my text and got mad that I said that he was going to be here more often because this is part of my room too. She said I was an asshole for bringing him over because he makes her uncomfortable if he stays there for long even though she claimed to be fine with him staying the day? The thing is I rarely am in the dorm  and always spending the night at my bf’s house due to her attitude towards us and her 5am hour long alarms. Btw they never met before and this is his fourth or third time meeting her and all he says to her is hi. She claims I don’t keep my word  (due to the accident bc I did say we would stay for a hour or so) and it’s not about my boyfriend but me—?AITA?Edit/INFO: Ok, I keep thinking people think I had him sleepover intentionally which is NOT the case. We were dead tired and slept at my room ONE TIME, I’m only human and I apologized. Literally she just hates him being there in general. Not only that the ratio between her being in the room alone and me being there with my boyfriend is insane. I haven’t even gone to stay in my own room for 3 months because of her problem with my bf and her hour long 5am alarms.Edit 2: HE HAS ONLY VISITED THREE TO FOUR TIMES THIS ENTIRE SEMESTER.

She said we were only going as characters from the first 2 games and listed who was dressing as who.I decided to not give up and see if I could create a Chica cosplay in the little time I had. Unfortunately, finding the stuff I need was hard and it wouldn't arrive in time. She said I could just do face paint but I didn't want to go out in yellow face paint. I gave up and asked if I could instead go as mangle, but unfortunately, someone was already going as her, and it happens that they were originally going as Chica.It became very clear that no one wanted to go as Chica so I figured it would be best if no one did. I mentioned that instead of making everything super specific, we should just dress as who we want and have fun. She said everyone else already has their costumes and they've been planning this for months. It was starting to feel like she didn't want me to go and saw me as an opportunity to have Chica in their group. I told her that she was being nitpicky and should be glad that I'm willing to dress up at all with only 2 days notice.She went off on me saying I can just not go and I was \"shitting on\" her idea that she's been planning for months. I told her that I wasn't shitting on her ideas and that it was impossible for me to make a Chica cosplay in time and that if she was planning this for months, she could have invited me a while ago, giving me time to make a cosplay as it's not like I hadn't shown interest in seeing FNAF. She made it seem like I was required to cosplay and then proceeded to not let me make minor changes.I told her that if she's gonna invite someone last minute, she needs to allow minor changes.

I explained to A our financial situation, exacerbated by my unemployment, which made it impossible for us to treat her. Also A already knew this fact before as I told her lunch was stretching it for us but we wanted to say goodbye. After lunch, we returned home, I told A that I was getting rid of things for the move some to Sell some to give away. A had already asked me if I could give away some stuff to her because she was also moving and broke, A eagerly took everything she could, items we couldn't fit in our new place, which I could have sold but I chose to gift her because she asked. A misunderstanding arose with an item that belonged to my wife.  The situation was uncomfortable, and my wife, likely trying to be too nice, chose not to confront her. I akwardly had to adress it later that day apologizing and telling her that my wife wanted money for it but she could also sell it for us or whatever later when she could no big deal. Over a month passed, and A still hadn't paid us for lunch or addressed the issue with my wife's item, and neither did I as I did not want to confront her she had been avoiding me I knew she was not paying us back. My wife, fed up with her non-payment, decided to call and confront her. A's response was to play the victim, get angry, misgender my wife by referring to her as a DUDE and hang up the phone to my wife. So now my wife is angry at me for letting her deal with A instead of dealing with A myself, and A is angry at me for letting my wife call her but I've reached a breaking point with A and I needed a break from her as she tends to be a lot to handle and I just could not deal with her. This was my final straw, seeing on Insta she was out spending money, eating and partying. Her actions almost left my wife and me unable to afford groceries, which was hurtful and stressful and was angry and so was my wife but still I chose not to confront A. I didn't want to be guilt-tripped or gaslighted by her. However, my wife decided to call her. I remained unaware of the conversation, as I had requested not to be involved for my mental well-being. But now they are both angry at me and say I am the asshole for not dealing with the situation myself now find myself with a friend who has accused me of sending my wife as a henchman, receiving an angry WhatsApp message from A, calling me petty and immature for letting $30 (it was $50) destroy our friendship and waiting for me to apologize to her.

Chelsea is a very fun person, but a lot of the times her jokes go too far and even though I have tried to tell her so, she refuses to admit that it can be a problem, and (this is mine and my husband's own fault) we haven't given her strict enough consequences regarding this growing up for reasons I can't fit into the character count. Anna just got her learner’s permit and has been going out in the car with me or my husband and driving around the neighborhood, just so she can get used to being behind the wheel for her on-road lessons.Chelsea decided it would be funny to buy some fireworks poppers and put them under the wheel of the car, so that they’d pop when Anna pulled out of the driveway. The prank itself was harmless since those things are meant to be stepped on and no actual damage was done to the car or anyone inside it, but it was Anna’s 3rd or 4th time behind the wheel ever, and she was already not super confident, and the loud noise freaked her out so much that she accidentally stepped on the accelerator got scared that she was losing control of the car.She was fine, but anyone who’s learnt how to drive a car knows what it’s like when you’re very new to driving and what it feels like to not be able to control the vehicle. I got out of the car to check what Anna had driven on and saw Chelsea laughing hysterically from the garage. I asked her if she knew what had happened, and she told me what she had done. I told Chelsea that it could have been very dangerous if Anna had completely lost control of the car and sped it up any more, to which Chelsea replied that if Anna can’t handle a tiny distraction then she shouldn’t be driving in the first place. I reminded Chelsea that she was just as inexperienced in driving when she was 16 and that she should understand that this is not the time to pull such pranks, but Chelsea insisted that it “isn’t that deep” and went inside.As I stated above, this isn’t the first time that Chelsea’s pranks have gone too far, and I was tired of her never learning, so I told her that I would be taking her keys on Saturday and she would be taking my husband’s car to help Anna learn how to drive, with my husband or I in the back seat. She has plans on Saturday to go to lunch with a friend she hasn’t seen in a while, so she didn’t think I was serious, but after I actually confiscated the keys, she had been insisting that I’m being too harsh and “parentifying her to make her teach her sister and miss out on her own life”. My husband agrees with my motives but thinks that Chelsea is too old for such punishments and needs to learn these things herself in the real world. I feel bad that she is missing her plans and agree that she is too old to be disciplined by her mother like this, but she’s gone this long without consequences and I really think it has to stop.

	"body" : "So I 21M have been friends with this girl Anna for maybe 2 years now. Anna (22F) is a lovely girl but she is… Unfortunate looking. She is overweight, has no chin, and is pretty spotty. She has a beautiful smile though, and she is a lovely and bubbly person, and a joy to be around. We both work on a holiday resort, and we live in a work allocated accommodation. Recently a new guy joined. He is very attractive. Perfect teeth, perfect skin, tall, mixed race, and built like a superhero. He’s a pretty cool guy, but you can tell he’s always been good looking because he’s pretty smug. But he isn’t like totally unbearable.This new guy has been put in the room next door to Anna.  And she understandably has a huge crush on him. He has been friendly with her, and they talk fairly often. She gives him rides to the gym and around town. But there are a few issues. One, the guy has a girlfriend, and she unsurprisingly also looks like a movie star. He talks about her quite often and he obviously likes her. Second issue is Anna reads into their every interaction way too much, and her friends hype her up. “Omg he hugged me and called me a legend when I offered to drive him to the gym” “omg he responded to my dm” etc etc.Her friends hype her up and tell her to go for it and are putting it in her head he might like her, even though, he definitely doesn’t but I tried to just ignore it. I tried to warn him about what was going on and while talking to him about Anna yesterday, he said “she’s such a lovely girl, it’s a shame she a dog”. And he then went onto say “I don’t think there is a single thing attractive about her”. That sort of spelt things out loud and clear.Earlier her friends were again hyping her up after he responded to another dm of hers, and she said she was going to ask him out (keep in mind she KNOWS he has a gf) and I felt so awful I had to stop it.  I told her she has no hope, ever, that he has a girlfriend who he realistically is never going to leave for her, and that her friends should be ashamed of themselves for feeding her delusions. I then said that he barely sees her as a friend and she should get real and drop her obsession before she gets hurt or humiliated. Anna teared up and ran out of the room, and one of her friends went after her. The rest of her friends started berating me and then also followed her.Thing is she was literally about to do it right there and I snapped into action. I feel I worded it harsher than I had to and am wondering if I should have just let her get rejected. AITA?",

Neither of the two father's of her children are in the picture, one is in prison and the other has sadly passed away. So she shares the holidays with her extended in laws and this was their year.When my step mum found out Sophie was going to be alone, she extended an invite to Sophie as well. She was worried Sophie would feel alone in her house with the 4 children making noise. Sophie gladly accepted and was excited to attend. Sophie and my step mum get on really well, they have done since I introduced Sophie to them. They have gotten closer since we announced that Sophie is pregnant. Dad isn't Sophie's biggest fan. He wasn't happy I brought a white woman home.On Christmas Day, just as we were about to leave Sophie's my dad called and told me that Sophie was no longer invited. He told me that I should still come as my son and daughter (both teens) were about to arrive and I should come and see them. I told him that if Sophie wasn't welcomed and then neither was I.  He tried arguing that I should still go for the sake of my kids and I told him no and hung up. Ever since my dad has been sending me messages saying that I ruined Christmas and I let down my kids yet again. I had messaged them (they don't answer calls) to let them know what had happened and they chose to go to my dad's because that's where their presents were. Sophie is feeling bad that it's because of her that my dad is angry. Step mum has messaged her telling Sophie it's not her fault but Sophie still feels like it's her fault. My siblings think that I should have just swallowed my pride and gone without Sophie but it didn't feel right to leave the mother of my child on her own at Christmas.AITA for not attending Christmas after my girlfriend was excluded?Edit: We did a video call that evening after they'd had dinner. I'm taking them both out to the football this evening, which is our tradition. My daughter is a keen footballer while my son supports the team we're going to watch. I used to not be very involved in their lives until 5 years ago. I now see them regularly and am actively involved. They just don't answer calls, even from their mother. Neither of them like talking on the phone and would rather text. Video calls happen occasionally.Edit: I'm not able to post comments due to some mode being active. To answer some questions, Sophie and I have been together for 18 months. The pregnancy was unplanned, a combination of a birth control not working, and a condom split. We were being careful as we'd both said we were done having anymore children. Id been having problems getting my GP to refer me for a vasectomy,  im now on the waiting list. When Sophie found out she was pregnant, we went back and forth on it before deciding to keep the baby.",

We dated for a bit in high school then amicably broke up after graduation and then got back together in our late 20s. Because we're from a small town and have known each other for so long, we have really strong bonds with each other's families as well. I have four siblings and he has two.We both grew up in regular lower-middle class families in a small town. I am a hairstylist and my husband is a physician. We're low-key people so our lives are still very normal despite his higher income (regular house, 2 regular cars, public school for the kids, that type of thing).Long story short is this -- my husband's brother & wife have gone through a tough time these past few years. His wife's mom was taking care of their kids (infant + toddler) while both parents worked. His wife's mom unfortunately passed away so they lost their childcare + his wife fell into a depression and wasn't able to work or care for the kids. They were in a tough spot for about 2 years (lost income due to the job + additional childcare payments each month) and are now coming out of this hole. They were on the verge of losing their home when my brother-in-law turned to my husband and (for the first time ever) asked for help. My husband and I agreed on $30K.It's been about two years and my sister-in-law is now in a better place, able to find work, the kids have more secure and affordable childcare, and overall things are looking up.My husband mentioned to me he was gonna ask his brother about setting up a payment plan to get the money back and I told him that it would be better to just forgive the \"loan\". My brother-in-law works a regular job and $30K is just a huge amount of money to pay back on a regular income. I truly feel that the gesture of brotherhood is worth so much more than the money. My in-laws are such good people and I really believe in helping your family as much as you can.My husband disagreed and we got into discussing it and I said I think it's selfish to ask for the money back. It's a HUGE thing for them and not an issue for us. I told him they'll have to restructure their whole lives in order to make these payments whereas we will continue with the same standard of living with/without the money.

Last year, in my language and my biology class, I had a few altercations with a kid in my class (15M, who we'll call Dave). It hasn't been too serious, just Dave calling me bimbo as I'm blonde and I found it funny and ironic since I'm top of the class, so I decided to play along since I thought it was a joke. I started to call Dave 'discord mod' as he's always on discord during class rather than doing work. Both the Bio and lang teachers never told me off for it and I thought that it wasn't even that bad of a name compared to bimbo. Come June of last school year and I got pulled into the principal's office for 'bullying' Dave. I got dismissed once I told the principal about the bimbo thing and I stopped and he did too. We both hate each other and he has told me this multiple times.This year, I got placed in an advanced mathematics class. Maths have always come easy to me and I always get good grades in maths classes, but Dave has always struggled so I was confused when I saw he was in my class. Our maths teacher always changes seats at the start of every month and I got placed next to him in the recent seating change, which was a shock as I thought the teacher knew of our past issues. I asked to change seats but the teacher said I should try and stick it out and said that if it gets really bad he'll change it.As I said before, Dave has struggled with maths, so I'm not surprised that he has been failing this class and has been failing every test and quiz. Recently my teacher has had ear surgery done so his hearing has been bad. Every time I answer a question (he allows us to answer without raising our hands occasionally) he doesn't hear me the first time so I raise my hand waiting for him to see and call on me. Dave sits closer to him than I do so he loudly shouts an answer before the teacher can call on me or someone else, and his answer is exactly what I said before, word for word, and has a stupid smirk on his face when he answers. I recently confronted him about it after class and he rolled his eyes and said 'I know you have a small bimbo brain but I'm not copying you believe it or not' and that really pissed me off, so I said ' is spending all your time on discord killing your brain cells that you need to copy my answers?' we argued a bit more until he eventually said I should 'go back to the kitchen.' this got me fuming so I responded 'undermining women in stems achievements AND telling me I should go back to the kitchen? Sounds very sexist, I didn't realise you supported the patriarchy, but I'm not surprised since you're an incel.'He told on me, of course, and my dad got pissed at me for that saying I took it 'too far' while my mum was proud of me sticking up for myself, and my friend group is divided between whether that was smart of me or stupid considering I'll probably get in even more trouble once Monday rolls around.

I suggested she figure out a way and use her own kid food scissors to cut the food.  She didn’t get the scissors.  So my husband got up and picked up the long adult scissors and cut her food, then asked her if she wanted to learn to cut her food using those adult scissors.I asked him if he was intending on teaching her to use adult scissors and we got into a fight.  My reasoning was, I did not want him teach her to use adult scissors in order to protect the safety of my 5yo child.From my husband’s point of view, he thought I was being overly critical about everything he does, and that he should be able to teach the kid to use adult scissors because he is right there watching her. He feels that if I wanted something done my way, I should have done it myself. “You criticizing me over the type of scissors shows that you do not trust me to raise the kid properly”We have had many fights previously about how to raise our child.  There are just some fights I do not think it is right to back down from when it concerns safety.  My husband, my daughter, and I are all known to be accident prone.  We keep Costco sizes of bandages in our home and actually use them regularly.  Another fight we had recently was me asking him to put a helmet on our child as they ride a motorized scooter to school.  Yet another fight was me asking him to return the extremely low to the ground go-kart that he had purchased with the intention of driving it to school (which is not street legal either).  One time, I witnessed him teaching our kid’s son to throw rocks *under* the car instead of at a car (and to crawl underneath the car in order to get the rocks).  It is this kind of lack of safety judgment that leads me to say these things because I just want us to raise our child safely.

In may, we relocated back to our home state, after I moved across the country to live with him.

My mother I had agreed we could stay with her for a couple months, but ultimately she kicked us out. We stayed on a friends property, living in a tent, for 3 months. Essentially homeless.We both have been working everyday to pay off credit card debt and save money to get a place. In July I put everything I had, $2500, towards paying off my credit cards, to which I asked him to contribute and I would repay him, because we needed to repair my credit in order to get a place. He said he wanted to have some comfort and have at least $3000 before he would help me.Some things hit the fan with my friends family, a lot of things going on that had nothing to do with my partner or I. We decided the environment wasn’t good and we have been staying in extended stay hotels for 3 weeks now. My boyfriend than asked his father to co-sign and he agreed. So now he is set on finding a rental.My boyfriend makes significantly more money than I do. I am not financially ready to rent, my credit is not fixed, I don’t have my half to bring to the table. But my boyfriend is adamant that we rent as soon as possible and that he will put up the full amount and I can pay him back later.I don’t love this concept. I was previously in an abusive relationship and have a fear of owing my partner money, being indebted and not being able to carry my weight. I was raised to be independent and to not allow a man to take care of me. I wanted to feel like I had accomplished my goal.

I’m trying to get my boyfriend to take a day off of work so that we can go arrange to go see rental properties together, to which he insists I can take a day off because I make less money and he is providing the money.It’s not that I don’t want to have the money and it’s not for a lack of not being at work since I work everyday. I have been taking care of my indivual responsibilities, to get US, closer to where we needed to be by paying off my credit card debt.He is consistently making comments that I’m not doing my part, that I’m not trying enough, and that I am ungrateful because I am not excited that is willing to foot the bill.

	"body" : "My brother has been traveling the world for the last nine months. He’s probably taken at least 12 weeks vacation to do so. He’s been to Japan, Cuba, Argentina, Sweden, etc. I haven’t left the country (USA) since 2019, and I’ve been studying for a graduate school exam since 2022, so I haven’t been able to travel at all even if I wanted to.  Six months ago, he asked me what my dream vacation would be. I told him that once I’m done applying to schools I would finally go to my dream vacation in Tbilisi. I’ve studied and love Soviet history, I’ve been reading about and researching Tbilisi, I like that it isn’t the most typical vacation destination, and I even have a connection that I would visit there. Once I’m done applying, I would take 2 weeks to go celebrate my hard work as a reward.He asked me once since then if I would go with him, and immediately I was annoyed and just said “no” via text.  I was annoyed because I had told him that I’m not going until I’m done studying and the time is right, and he knew that. I hoped he got the message and wouldn’t go to Tbilisi. Instead he tells me a week ago that he’s already bought tickets with a friend. Two days after that he tries to invite me to go with them. He knows I’m still studying and can’t go.He has since sent me a confirmation email written in Georgian to show how excited he is to go. I’m already dreading the updates he will send me from Tbilisi.AITA for being really annoyed at him for this? He’s been traveling the world so much, and I was happy for him, but I kind of wanted this one thing to be special for me. And he knew that because I told him. He could’ve gone anywhere else in the world. I really don’t think he would’ve gone to Tbilisi on his own without me telling him it was my dream. Why couldn’t he just let me have my dream without kind of spoiling it first? It feels like he just took my dream and doesn’t care how it will affect me. When he’s back from his trip, I’m going to tell him that I resent him for it and I think he’s an asshole for doing it.UPDATE:My brother did not offer to take me (and I don’t think he should have! Idk why anyone thought I would have expected that). We would split any costs.He doesn’t know GeorgianHe wasn’t really familiar or interested until a few months ago when I told him ab the place.No one else going bothers me at all. Surprised I have to make this clear. I’m only upset at my brother. It’s a straw man to say anyone else going bothers me.",
