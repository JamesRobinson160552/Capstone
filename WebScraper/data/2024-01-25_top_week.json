	"body" : "I post my food pics from when I go out to eat on Instagram. It's just for fun, I spend like 30 minutes a week on it, tops. My boyfriend is a very sweet guy in many ways, but one thing that I'm not so much a fan of is that he often hops on the bandwagon of hating on innocent things. Not just not liking something, but making sure everyone knows he doesn't like it even if nobody asked. I can't help but notice a theme: Pumpkin spice lattes, pouty selfies, Taylor Swift, etc. As you can guess, he is not a fan of of the food pics and thinks it's very annoying and cringe. He doesn't even follow my insta even though he has an account :(Even though I don't have very many followers, I have started getting occasional offers and invitations from restaurants in my city to try their food for free in exchange for a review. Nothing crazy—no steak dinners so far—but I've gotten a few sandwiches and several baked goods.Well, I just hit the big leagues and got invited to a new restaurant opening that includes a free appetizer and entree for me and one guest. I immediately invited one of my Instagram friends who I have gone out to eat with on several occasions and who also enjoys taking food photos. I told my boyfriend and he's pissed that I'm not taking him and says I'm doing it out of spite—I really think I'm not? If the restaurant is giving me free food in exchange for a post, I'm gonna put more effort into the post and spend a few extra minutes making sure that I actually get very good shots, and I'd rather do it with someone who isn't going to sigh and roll their eyes through the whole thing. Also, I think it's pretty audacious of him to be actively unsupportive of an activity that hurts no one, but then also expects to benefit when it's actually successful.",

	"body" : "Basically my in-laws want their only child, my wife Diana, to start pumping out grandchildren.Diana is 28 and just finishing her PhD. Then she wants to get established in a career before we start a family.My in-laws know how much money I make and they know we could live comfortably off my earnings. That isn't what Diana wants. She has worked her ass off to get where she is and she wants to reap the rewards of here hard work. She also says that once she is working then I can cut back on my hours I'm a welder, and relax a little. I have been working since I was 15, so literally half my life. I make a very good living in return for a lot of fairly hard work. I have supported Diana and her education. She will graduate without student loans. We have a house. She has a good car. We have a good life. We want a few more years alone before we start our family.Over Christmas the in-laws just wouldn't drop it. I finally snapped. I said that if they wanted grandchildren then they could reimburse us for her education. They could further pay her the salary she would be giving up. When she returned to work they could pay her the difference between what she could be earning and her entry level position. They could pay for a nanny so my wife could work.Or they could back off and wait for us to be ready.They said that they couldn't afford all that. I asked them how they expected us to afford it. I said that if it was really what they wanted they could just give her the inheritance that would be coming her way now instead of later.They got all offended and said that is not hers until they don't need it any more.Diana asked me to drop it. She has tried dozens of times to explain to her parents why we are waiting. They just ignore her. They ignore what we want for our lives.They have been very cold since Christmas. They seem to think I was a rude asshole for pointing out the costs of what they are asking for. A lot of her family agree with them that I went too far in asking them to pay if they want a grandchild now instead of later.",

	"title" : "AITA for making my wife pay me for something she gave away",
	"body" : "My wife has a bad habit of giving away or lending out things that don’t belong to her. I’ve lost count of how many times I go to look for something of mine only for her to say she lent it to somebody. She also takes forever to get the item back, she once lent my stuff  to a coworker and refused to ask for it back for a month. And I’ll never forget the day my usually quiet, reserved son snapped at her for trying to give away his Nintendo switch. If I wasn’t also fed up with her behavior I would have washed his mouth out with soap. I’ve had countless talks with her but she continues to do this. My son and I have resorted to locking up anything we didn’t want touched which is something we shouldn’t have to do in our own home.Last week I won a $300 tent in a raffle. I had no plans on using it so I was selling it. When I found a buyer and went to look for it I couldn’t find it. When I asked my wife she said she gave it to a friend of ours. I got mad at her and said she had no right to give it away. Her defense was since I didn’t spend money on it and was i planning on using it, it made sense to give it away for free. I told her that wasn’t her decision to make but she just kept repeating herself.I had enough of this and said she’s either going to pay me herself or get the money from who she gave it to, and if she didn’t I’d get law enforcement involved. Since she rather die than ask a friend for money she paid me out of her own pocket.This issue eventually got around to her family. While they did say she should have talked to me first they also reprimanded me for asking for payment. They reasoned that since I didn’t actually buy the tent I didn’t loose any money and it went to a friend who could actually put it to good use. I got several text saying I should be ashamed for extorting my wife for money. I think I have every right to want to be paid for something of mines that was taken but every one keeps emphasizing the fact that I didn’t technically buy the tent and didn’t want it so I have nothing to be upset about.

	"title" : "AITA for refusing to hand over my college fund for my little sister's surgery?",
	"body" : "I (17M) am the oldest kid in my family. My parents have two bio kids; me and my 12 year old sister and they adopted my 4 other siblings. I had dozens of foster siblings over the years as well. My parents have struggled to make time and have the money for all of us. It has meant a lot of sacrificing and mostly on my part. My parents were able to make sure all my younger siblings had at least one activity outside of school to do but they never did that for me. I was forced to play football when I was 5 but by the time I was 7 my parents had started fostering and I was no longer doing that. My siblings all get to do something they like. Cora does dance for example. Some of my other siblings are in music classes.The younger kids were also prioritized with school field trips. So they always got to go while I haven't since I was 6. The last time I asked was when I was about 9 and my parents told me to work for the money to pay. My grandparents found out what they said and gave me the money and my parents took it off me to use for the household. My grandparents were so mad at  them for that.They delayed my tonsil surgery by 2 years because they prioritized 2 foster kids and two of my siblings surgeries over mine.My grandparents saw how much I was getting the short end of everything with my parents and they set up a college fund for me. It's a lot of money and really caught me off guard. My parents know about it but cannot access it. They only know because of a fight with my grandparents over the lack of saving for my future when they have saved something for my siblings. My parents said the money my grandparents saved should be divided equally because $350,000 is a lot to save for one grandchild when you have multiple.That money is still there and I have plans for it. But my youngest sister is 5 and she needs a pretty major stomach surgery. She's had a lot of health troubles since her birth and my parents have paid a lot of money on her medical expenses. They were told this surgery could turn her life around and give her a chance at living with less pain and stomach complications. It could give her a more normal childhood because she can't do a lot. They don't have the money for the surgery and they want me to give them the money to pay for it and for the expenses afterward. They said they need $270,000 for the whole thing and maybe they can give some of it back but they might need even more if stuff gets more complicated. I told them they can't have that money and they lost it and told me I was being selfish and I argued back that they take from me all the time. I asked why they didn't take the money they saved for all my siblings and use that, why does it have to be mine. They said I am putting college before my sister's future and accused me of being unwilling because she's my sister through adoption and not my bio sister.AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for suggesting my friend go back to therapy after how she reacted in a Chinese Restaurant?",
	"body" : "So yesterday, me (28F), Jess (27F) and 3 other friends (mid to late 20sF) went to a Chinese restaurant. I’m Chinese, Jess is half Japanese/Chinese and the rest of my friendship group are Asian, if that’s relevant.For context, Jess unfortunately was victim to a verbal racist attack when covid first started. It was such an awful thing to happen and I’m still mad it happened. The incident traumatised her quite badly and she went to therapy for a couple of years.We are getting seated and there is a Caucasian man with his son (maybe 6-8 years old). They smile at me and I smile back. Anyway, our food comes and the kid is curious and I can hear him asking his dad “what are those ladies eating?”.The dad happily explains to his son the different kinds of seafood (like pipis), and pork belly and noodle dishes we were eating. It was really clear that they weren’t making fun of the food or us, and honestly I thought it was cute that the kid was interested. But Jess started getting agitated. I asked her what was up and she said she didn’t like that they were talking about us. Me and my friend tried to just say they were just talking about the food we were eating. Unexpectedly (as Jess is quite shy), she stood up and said to the dad, “this isn’t a zoo, you know?”. Then she walked out and some of us followed her out and me and another friend apologised to the man and kid who were really shocked.Outside m, we were trying to console Jess. She was adamant that the man was teaching his kid to be racist but we were all trying to tell her it wasn’t like that, and she said we were invalidating her. This went back and forth with us trying to say that the man and kid weren’t being racist. Finally, in my effort to try help, I suggested maybe Jess should go back to therapy.Jess gave me a really dirty look, called me a shit friend and left. A couple of my friends, although acknowledging that the way Jess reacted to the man and kid was abnormal, told me it wasn’t my place to suggest that, but my other friend said that I wasn’t wrong and as her friend who cares about her well-being, I had a right to suggest that.Jess and I have been friends since high school and I spent a great deal of time supporting her after the racist incident.AITA?——————UPDATE AND EDIT: Thanks everyone for your replies. For those asking what happened, essentially a group of men approached and surrounded her at a train station, shouting racists comments at her. If someone hadn’t intervened, she would have very likely been bashed or SAed.For those saying I should drop her as a friend, we’ve had a friendship that’s lasted nearly 15 years. I’m not going to give up on her because of an incident like this - and she honestly has never done anything like this before. She needs support and when the incident occurred I didn’t know how to appropriately handle it.Thank you everyone for your advice about it being wrong timing. Upon reflection and talking with my friends, we realised that none of us saw the signs early enough during that dinner that she was in crisis. We should have seen it when she started getting agitated inside the restaurant and perhaps taken her outside for a moment instead of dismissing her. None of us are really equipped to deal with someone in mental crisis and we are considering going to mental health first aid.Finally, I tried to call and then message Jess and apologise but she did not reply. However, her mum did call me today (I did not message her mum) and told me that Jess felt really bad about what happened and wanted to apologise to me and my friends. Jess also said she didn’t mean what she said about me being a bad friend and she was having a panic attack at the time. Jess isn’t feeling ready to talk to us yet and would rather her family support her for now until she’s feeling better. In the meantime, we will be sending chocolates and self care items.",

	"body" : "My wife and I are in our sixties, we are thinking of retiring soon and we are trying to get our finances and everything we own in order. For example we're finally selling our old house because it's too big and we don't need it, we want to live in a quieter place and a smaller house.We have three kids, all adults by now. Each of our kids have their own kids as well. We have a daughter with one kid, a son with two and another son with two biological kids and a stepdaughter.Our youngest son was married, about ten or so years ago he cheated on his wife and they got divorced. He cheated with his current wife, then he adopted her daughter.We want to divide our state between our children and our grandchildren. We had a family gathering to talk about some of these things, especially the house in case any of our children wanted to buy it themselves.Our son got very angry when he heard that we're cutting off his adopted child from the will. We told him she's not our family and we don't support his life choices and how he ruined his family. He told us to stop holding a grudge for something that happened years ago and accept the child, or cut him and his family off. My wife and I think that his new wife and the child are living proof of him ruining his family. Do you think we are wrong in this? She is a child and he's right that she's \"his\", but does that automatically makes her our family? He said we're treating his wife and daughter poorly and we're acting like assholes towards a kid.The step daughter and the adopted daughter are the same girl. My son married her mother and then adopted her.Questions:The girl was 1 or 2 years old when my son and his mother started their relationship.We don't see or talk to each other often, only in family gatherings. They live in another state. She doesn't call us her grandparents.What each of our kids is getting are family heirlooms and not money. All the money will be distributed between our grandkids in our will to hopefully help them get their education paid.My son doesn't have contact with his ex wife or his biological kids, he cut them off and didn't even want to pay child support. My wife and I helped our daughter in law and our grandchildren.To make it clear. What my son is getting from us is some photos and items from his childhood that we keep. It's essentially \"trash\" but we like to look at them every once in a while to remember our kid's childhoods. He isn't getting money or jewelleryI'm getting a lot of comments, sorry if I can't answer all the questions.For those who wonder if the girl could actually be biologically my son's daughter, i don't know and it doesn't make a difference to me or my wife.For those who say that love should be unconditional, I disagree. Love is always conditional to the bare minimum to maintain a bond, that's my opinion.Yes, my son's two biological kids (the kids he had with his first wife) are in the will along with our two other kids' children.Our grandchildren are getting some heirlooms too, the things we're giving to our son aren't things that our other two kids would want.For those who are saying that I would neglect a child adopted by my children under different circumstances, no. This is all about the circumstances in which this girl and my son's new wife came into the family. I don't care if she's adopted or biological, it'll be the same for me. The circumstances in which my son cheated (which is bad enough) and proceeded to kick his family out and abandon them are the reason why neither my wife, me or the rest of our family has a good relationship with the three of them.My two other kids agree with us and aren't close to their brother either.",

	"title" : "AITA for refusing to do a portrait for my bf, leaving him without a wedding gift?",
	"body" : "I do digital portraits, mostly as a hobby, but I have gotten a few commissions here and there. A while ago, my boyfriend and I were hanging out with mutual friends and my boyfriend suggested in front of everyone that I do a portrait as a gift for someone's upcoming birthday. While it was a little annoying to be volunteered by him, I did think it was a good gift idea and went ahead and did it. The next time a birthday in the group came up, my bf made the same suggestion and as a result \"the birthday portrait\" has kind of become my thing. My boyfriend will get something small as his gift since he views the portrait as being \"from us.\"The part where I may be the asshole here is that I haven't told him explicitly to stop volunteering me for these portraits. It is my fault for going along with the birthday gift thing for our friends without saying anything, but I kind of assumed that he would at least keep these requests within the realm of common sense.Well...his college buddy is getting married, and my boyfriend told him that I would make him a portrait of him and his bride as a wedding gift. I have never even met this person! To make matters worse, he apparently made this promise weeks ago but only told me about it today, and the wedding is this Saturday. I finally lost it at him and told him that I'm not his personal portrait sweatshop, and that he only does this because he's a cheapskate and it gets him out of spending any money on a gift, even though it costs me a lot of time.He argued back that a bespoke portrait is so much better than just buying something off the resume, that it's a generous thing for me to do, it helps build my portfolio, and that I don't get very many paid commissions anyway. For the record—I don't get many paid commissions because I don't charge peanuts for them. I have a full time job, so I price according to what would be worth giving up the amount of free time that it takes me.He told me that I put him in a really difficult position, that he hyped up the portrait, and they were both really looking forward to it. He said please just do this one and I won't ask again. I said no, I don't even know these people, this is so not my problem.He looked up a couple of portrait artists online, but none of them were willing to do the piece on the short turnaround he needed + at the quality he wanted + at the price he was willing to pay. He even tried using an AI image generator—which was a complete slap in the face to me as an artist—but all of the outputs were very obviously AI. He's begging me to please just do this one and he will make it up to me on my birthday, but (especially after he apparently thought my work was so worthless that it could be effortlessly reproduced by a machine), I'm just really not in the mood.",

	"body" : "So, I know it might seem a bit stupid, but its important to me. It is currently a argument with my family. I(25, F) had my prom in 2017 and I bought my entire prom outfit for myself due to my family not having the best economy and I saved for over a year to be able to buy my dream dress and jewelry(everything in total about $300, which is a lot for us). I had an amazing time and that dress is very important to me since I have never had the best self confidence and it made me feel beautiful.Now my sister(18, F, lets call her Annie) is having her prom later this year and she asked if she could use my dress as well. She loves it and wished to use it. I told her that I would prefer if she didnt since it is so important to me(I also have a nero disorder and it makes it hard for me to let other people use my things) and she said okay and said she at least wanted to ask, but she was fine with finding another dress and I said Id help pay if she wanted (and if she wanted, she was welcome to use the jewellry, she will wear the hair accessories) I am pretty stable in income. Annie thanked me and said we could go shopping together.Now, I live about three hours away from my family due to school and I dont go home often due to not having a car. I came home last week to visit as my nephews(cousins kids, shes like a sister) are getting baptised. When I walk through the front door to my parents house, Annie is wearing my prom dress and my grandma and mom are taking messurments. I ask them what they are doing and they said that I'm being am AH for not letting Annie use it. She is my \"baby sister\" after all(moms words). I got upset and screamed at Annie to take it off, which I later apologised for, she believed I changed my mind since mom said I had agreed. I yelled at my mom and grandma because they tried to go behind my back and even change the dress to better fit Annie, she is 155lbs, I was almost 300lbs when I wore it. I cried and yelled at them. As soon as Annie came back with my dress, I took it and packed it down, saying I'd stay with my cousin.Now my family is torn. Some people agreeing with me and some saying Im an AH for not letting Annie use it. I dont feel like I was in the wrong for not letting her use it, after all it was all my dress that I payed for and I even offered to pay for her dress.So AITA?EDIT: Since a lot of people have mentioned not wearing it again. I have worn it since. It's not the typical \"prom dress\", its more a flowy summer dressAlso, the reason I didn't bring it with me is because I live in a dorm room and I could only bring the essentials with me. Once I move to a bigger place, I planned on bringing all my stuff to my new place. The dress is currently at my cousins place and I might bring it back with me when I go home.Please don't blame my sister for this. Her and I have talked it out and we're on good terms.

I wouldn't miss that lab if my house was on fire, lol.Missing the rest of lab would suck, too. My friends said they'd record it, but unlike my lectures our lab is completely visual, so a recording is useless.

But she said wow, so your grades are more important than me and my health? I said it's not more important, but it is important. I said she could go to the bookie at our school and buy Advil. She was close by because I parked my car in the garage of that building, but she said she's in way too much pain to go.Plus, she said she's literally bleeding through her clothes and has no tampons.

Which resulted in her getting upset I was making it her fault and she called me sexist and said I have no idea what it's like for her. I agreed I didn't, but said I'd be there in 20 minutes.I took the quiz and ended up meeting her at my car 20 minutes later with Advil, tampons, and water. But she is not happy.

I have always covered up as best as I could with large hoodies, big t-shirts and so on. I have always dressed this way as I genuinely was ashamed and hated my body. I started working at 16 knowing my main goal was to afford a breast reduction, last year I was finally able to afford it and got them done. They are still a bit on the bigger side, but I have never ever felt so comfortable and happy in my own body as I do now (not to mention the weight that has LITERALLY been lifted off my shoulders!?).So this last weekend my sister and her husband came to visit our family, and we had planned a dinner at a restaurant. It was nothing extravagant, but still a pretty nice place. I just wore jeans with a tight fitting shirt, it did not show my breast but since it is tight fitting you can see the outline of them. I thought everything went well, we all chatted and talked like usual, but a bit in I noticed BIL was staring at me extremely much. I got kind off uncomfortable and I think my sister also noticed and she was silent for almost the whole night after that. I thought she was mad at BIL and that she could see that I was uncomfortable with his stares.But the same night she texted me, telling me that I did not need to dress so inappropriate in front of a married man, that I need to have some self respect and that she did not think I was the type to try and seduce a married man. I texted her, explaining that it was not my intention and told her that I actually felt uncomfortable with his stares. She texted me back just saying that if I did not want him to stare, then I should have not dressed that way.I was extremely upset by all of this and talked with my mother, but my mother agreed with my sister.

Although it was unexpected,my mom and I's relationship changed drastically when her new boyfriend moved in. I tried to make a good impression because I wanted her to be happy but the guy just seemed to have an issue with me. He convinced my mom to start charging me rent because I had a part time job while still in school even though he was jobless and living off my mom.He would go in my room, go through my stuff and use some of my things without my permission. He even broke my laptop after using it without asking but my mom saw nothing wrong with his behaviour and always took his side. She would yell at me whenever I complained about how I didn't like him invading my privacy. He seemed very pleased with himself when my mom kicked me out.I didn't have enough to get a place so I survived by sleeping on friends couches as much as I could until they got tired of me and I had to sleep outside at times. Thankfully I was able to get a second job through someone I knew and I was able to save up and I just moved into a new place at the beginning of this month after months of not having anywhere to call home.A few days ago my mom's boyfriend reached out to me. Apparently my mom had a stroke and he tried guilting me into moving back to help her out because he got a job opportunity and has to move. I declined and told him that unfortunately I'm too busy trying to be an adult, it doesn't look like I can take time off that schedule to do that then hung up.",

There is a kid (12-14m, middle school aged) that comes down to the bus stop as well. I do not know him, nor his parents. This is relevant to the story. On Friday, when it was -11, he came out in nothing but a thin pullover.I felt like I couldn't ethically allow a kid to stand out in such cold weather when I had a warm car he could sit in. He took my offer and sat in my backseat while me and my daughter spoke. He kept his airpods in and didn't say much other than saying thank you. Busses were running ~15 minutes late as well so nobody really should've been out in that.However, yesterday while I was walking my dog a woman came up to me. She asked me why I took her son into my car. I explained that the weather was well into the negatives and he was not wearing a coat, and the bus was quite late. She told me to never do that again and that what I did was incredibly creepy and to leave her son alone.I was taken aback, I just offered the kid a warm place to sit and didn't even speak to him. I feel bad, because of course I never want to come across as creepy or overstepping boundaries, but I also feel like if the roles were reversed and I was unable to take my daughter to the bus stop, and this mom offered her a place to sit, I would be thankful.

My husband is an only child and his father was never in the picture.

My husband and I told both my MIL and my mother that we did not want our son's birth turned into a photo op. People taking pictures of me have always made me uncomfortable. My son had some complications immediately after he was born and he was rushed to the NICU. I wasn't able to see him for roughly 9 hours. Once I was allowed to go into the NICU my husband went with me as this was the first time I was officially meeting my newborn son. Next thing I know I look up and see my MIL using this opportunity as a photo op. I WAS FUMING. These were not the first pictures I wanted of my son or of my husband and I with our son. The next morning my MIL decided she wanted to come back and see our son who is now safe and in our room. I am running on maybe 2 hours of sleep, but still said it was okay for her to come. Once she was there I didn't really interact with her. I was just trying to rest. After she left she ended up calling my husband. This is when he decided to call her out on the photo op and how she completely violated a boundary that we clearly set.Her response floored me. She began yelling at my husband saying that I hate her, that I don't like her and I never have. That I am so hateful towards her. She said her reasoning for taking the pictures was because she thought that we would want to remember that moment and to her it wasn't a big deal and she didn't see the point of getting upset.Once all this happened I decided I needed to distance myself from her and focus on my new family. My husband agreed with doing this as well.Fast forward to about a week and a half ago. My husband and son had been sick for over a week. I was out doing errands and getting groceries. MIL asked me multiple times if I wanted anything from Sams Club. I would constantly tell her \"no, but thank you.\" She was doing the same to my husband and he would also respond \"no we are good thanks\". I return home and my son was screaming. He hadn't slept all day. We all decided to try to nap. My husband finally falls asleep and I finally get my son to fall asleep. About 10 minutes later there is a knock on my door. My dog goes flying and barking her head off waking up my son. I answer the door and say \"why are you here\". She says I wanted to bring you a rotisserie chicken, a trash can, and laundry detergent. I told her we already said we didn't want anything and to not show up at our house unannounced and that next time she tries to give us random crap I will immediately return it to her we don't want anything from her. She got angry and said \"she will never come over or speak to us again\" and slammed the door. AITA?",

	"body" : "When I (24f) was 5 my mother had her second child, my sister. We have different dad's and neither was involved when we were kids. My sister was born prematurely and this is when my mother went from being my mom to being an almost stranger to me. She spent all her time at the hospital with my sister and I was passed around from friends to family and even to strangers my mother and I didn't know, because an aunt would hand me over to someone in her husband's family or a family friend would pass me onto their friend.My sister was in the hospital for months and had many complications from being born so early. So was one of the youngest preemies in the hospital's history. When she started to get strong enough to go home complications due to her stomach were found and that required more time and more treatments. My mother was in and out of the hospital with her for the next couple of years as they performed surgeries and gave treatments when she would get sick. At that point even when my mother was home with my sister she would keep me somewhere else normally and the times I was home with her I was left alone and her focus was my sister.Then when my sister was two she was diagnosed with leukemia and that resulted in more treatments, more hospital visits and just never ever seeing them. By the time I was 10 my mother was okay leaving me at home while they were at the hospital so I was alone. It was around this time that my teachers started to suggest I might have dyslexia and the school reacted out to my mother but she was too focused on my sister to do anything for me.Nothing changed after my sister became cancer free and she was less sick and needed the hospital less. My mother was so devoted to her that she didn't pay attention to me and both were strangers to me.I started staying with my girlfriend's family as a teenager and my mother didn't care. I would only go back to her house when I needed to pick up more of my clothes or stuff. And when I turned 18 I moved out officially and got my dyslexia diagnosis.Now several years on I don't really have anything to do with my mother or my sister. I don't blame my sister for any of this. It's just no bond could form when we were younger and she's a stranger to me. My mother has started to have some health problems and turned to me for help. She told me I should be around more and doing stuff to help her because she's my mom. She also said my sister deserves a relationship with me and accused me of punishing my sister for existing. I told her that wasn't true but we were strangers and that was because of her (my mother). I also told her she hadn't been my mom since I was 5 and she had no right to ask me to care for her when she hasn't cared for me in almost 20 years.

	"body" : "My husband and I have been together for over a decade. During this time he's been in therapy on and off. He had a hard time finding a therapist that was right for him. A few of his therapists early on encouraged him to just medicate (with no regular sessions) and one pushed religion on him. Neither of these worked. What he needed was someone to meet with him semi regularly, not push their religious beliefs on him, and instead work with him to develop appropriate strategies/talk through issues. Whenever he told me about one of these more questionable strategies (i.e. pushing 'just love Jesus') I said I thought that was inappropriate and he should find a better therapist and go without until then.There have been long stretches where he has gone without therapy because my husband isn't generally good at taking care of himself. That falls on me. I have to remind him to do things to keep him healthy/taken care of. Drink water. Eat more than once a day. There are literally times I have had to tell him he needs to brush his teeth. He also gets anxious making any decisions on his own. I have to help him pick out new clothes, write emails to work colleagues or groups of friends. He can't make plans for us- I have to make them all. Or, I should say, I have to help him make the plans so then he can say he made them.He's a good person. He loves me so much. But he is so dependent on me. It is draining. I have to spend an hour at least once a week talking him through whatever crisis he's having. Sometimes this crisis is over what new collectable to buy. A collectable for him. That I do not have any interest in.I finally demanded that he look into therapists again. I told him I can not be his therapist and he cannot depend on me this much. He needs to start taking care of himself and get a therapist that will work with him to develop these skills. And he did! Which is great. However a month into therapy he said his therapist had homework for me. I was supposed to write out a list of all his great qualities- at least a page or two. (Mind you, this is after YEARS of me carrying all his emotional baggage, essentially mothering him, giving him credit for things I did so he could feel better about himself, and one year, I did in fact write out 100 things that I thought were great about him for a gift.)I was so frustrated. I said no. I said therapy is his work, not mine, and I've spent too many years of our lives solving things for him. It wasn't fair to ask me to sit down and do this homework when the point of his therapy was for him to build his own skills without depending on me all the time. He was upset but accepted it, and said he understood. Well, just the other day he told me that his therapist doesn't like me. And thinks I should be thanking and showing him appreciation more. I told him I didn't care what his therapist thought- they are his therapist.This does have me thinking though, AITA for not doing the homework his therapist assigned to me?",

The comments said that me asking him to adhere to the boundaries we established was reasonable. Some comments also suggested that I should not have implied that he works just to get away, so I was a little apologetic as well. After he came back I decided to talk to him about this.The conversation was a bit of a trainwreck. I brought up the fact that our income far exceeds ur current and projected expenses. That me and our son were missing him, and needed him to spend more time with us, and I made sure to stress that I appreciated all that he did.It just seemed like we were on completely different wavelengths. He said he kept on taking more lessons and students because he wanted us to have a good standard of living, have better vacations, better schools, a second house. I was dumbfounded. I never knew he felt that way. I stressed our current standard of living was great, we make enough money, and that if he thinks that way there's no end in sight. What if he decided we should also have a third house or something? Right now I needed him with me.At this point, I kind of lost control and started crying. I didn't mean to, it wasn't something I wanted to do to pressure him or anything, just the fact that we were at an impasse was wrecking me. I told him I'd been feeling unhappy, that I kept compromising and he reneged on it. After some more crying and consoling, my husband agreed that Sunday should have remained off-limits. He gently asked me to give him a pass for one more Sunday, because his students exams end next week, and he would make Sunday untouchable the following semester onwards. He also promised to try to resize his classes in order to be able to come back home for dinner even if it's late dinner. He asked for time to do all this.

Her school sent an email out two months ago asking for deposits for kids to secure their place on trip. It’s is about 150, and Mia asked me today to pay as the deadline is midnight or she may not be able to go.I reminded her what I said last time about deadlines and organisation and as she chose to tell me last minute I will not be paying for her deposit. She got upset as all her friends from history class are going.I told Mia that she can pay herself from her savings as she has a part time job, which is more than enough to cover her deposit, but she wanted to save up to buy a new game console.I told her to pick if she wanted to go on the trip or get a new game console and she called me an AH, and now I’m wondering if I’m being unreasonable. My husband is on my side but my youngest said it was mean and Mia is very upset with me.ETA- Mia doesn’t have ADHD, but she is dyslexic so this does explain the schoolwork sometimes, but she will ask for extensions on top of her extensions which is a sore spot for her and my husband who wants her to be more organised and not leave work last minute.Mia has been tested for ADHD and doesn’t not have it, I did my research at the time and realised it often gets overlooked for girls but even after getting another opinion she doesn’t have ADHD.

Her interest in medicine started when she was very young after I was babysitting her and Chloe and she saw all the books and anatomical displays in my office (I’m a Cardiologist). Just over a year ago, Tanha asked if I would be interested in adopting Jasmine as she couldn’t keep up with trying to raise two kids. I said I would only agree if that was what Jasmine wanted, I didn’t want to make such a change without her input. She was 14, not two. Jasmine was overjoyed and eagerly agreed to the adoption; I did make sure to have her in therapy. Here is where I may be the AH. Four months ago, a position opened up in Sweden. I talked it over with Jasmine and she was super excited and it would also put her in far better schools. So, after getting my work visa and filling out the paperwork we prepared for the move. Jasmine was chattering to all of her teachers and classmates about the move, and it did draw quite a lot of attention to her. I later had an angry Tanha, Jason and Chloe on my doorstep. They demanded to know why I was moving their daughter away from her family across the world, and throwing so much money on her education, clothing and electronics when I didn’t do the same for Chloe. I got mad, and this is where I may have overstepped. I snapped that they’d lost their right to claim Jasmine when they neglected her and threw her to the side just because Tanha couldn’t handle the fact that she and Chloe had twin siblings. That Jasmine deserved her chance to make her life the way she wanted it and that Tanha and Jason spoiled Chloe more than I ever did. So yes, I was favoring Jasmine because she needed someone on her side. Tahna broke down in tears, Chloe doing the same while sobbing and crying out that I hated her before they left as Jason called me a bitch for destroying his family. We didn’t hear anything more from them as we packed, and we moved three months ago. Jasmine thankfully wasn’t home for that conversation though I did tell her as I don’t believe in keeping secrets like that when she had a right to know. She cried but thanked me for not giving up on her or forgetting her. I’ve gotten several calls from our extended family berating me for moving and tearing Jasmine from her family calling me selfish and cold. I can’t help but worry I went too far. Am I an asshole?",

It took some time before I could talk about my past but when I was able to, my brothers lit a fire under me.

My brothers pushed me to talk to their attorney friend which I eventually did. He’s a business attorney but listened to my history then gave me his opinion. He then recommended me to his friend in a family law firm.In short, I paid almost 4 years of child support and according to my attorney, I have a good chance of stopping the child support payments and recovering at least some or possibly almost all of it because there is social media evidence that the boy was living with his biological father during that time. The attorney said that we can nail down the exact date they lived together during discovery then we’ll have a better picture of how much we can ask for.

At 9:45PM, J tells us to arrive later, because dinner is still going. But we’re almost there after one hour of public transport, so we still arrive at 10PM.The dessert isn’t served, main dishes leftover are on the table, people are not eating anymore. We greet everyone and J brings some chairs for us to sit at the table. P goes to the garden for a smoke, K and I sit next to M’s friends. They serve us some wine and we talk for a bit. One of them asks if we want some of the leftover duck in front of us, I decline saying we already ate beforehand. They ask us again 4 times and I end up accepting. I tell K to try some as I know J’s mom’s Peking duck is very tasty. We each eat around 4 slices. Meanwhile, 2 of my friends arrive and smoke outside waiting for dinner to end.Then, J’s mom sits to have a toast with M’s friend and I ask for a glass. I didn’t know but it is a premium wine a friend of M brought as a gift. I brought a bottle too, I thought it was fine.Around 11PM some family members leave. There’re only M’s friends, our friends, two cousins and us. Our friends are sitting on the other side of the table.One cousin is a pastry chef, he brought a handmade king cake. They cut the cake and some get a slice, including P. Two of our friends decline.Karaoke starts, we sing for a bit. There’re still 3 slices of king cake left, I want to ask for one. I tell K, she says “I got it, follow me”. However, once next to the plate she notices she’s in front of the TV displaying the karaoke. So she proceeds to directly take the plate in front of M, brushes her without noticing, and brings it next to my friends. We sit down to eat a slice each. Just after we finish eating, M comes and says “It was for family only”. We both are feeling so ashamed. When I saw K take the plate I found it a bit strange but nothing alarming.When I finally get to talk to J, I apologize for the king cake, he tells me smiling that K and I are stupid and we move on.The party keeps going and ends without trouble.2 weeks later, I get to see J (w/o K) for the first time since NYE. He tells me he never felt so ashamed to invite friends, his family saw us eating duck but his mom didn’t invite us to eat it. She was a bit angry that I asked to toast with her and M’s friends and the king cake was the cherry on top, we didn’t ask and stole it.He says his family will laugh at him for years because of this.He says he never wants to see K again and he’s really disappointed in me.I apologized for the king cake but not for the duck nor the toast as I feel like neither K nor I made a mistake here.K wants to write an apology letter along with a gift for this incident but is waiting for my approval.",

	"title" : "AITA for turning my wife’s family away at the door on Christmas?",
	"body" : "For context my wife and I have been together for more than a decade. In that time her family has been awesome. The only exceptions to this are my wife’s paternal aunt and uncle.The two have a tendency to do really odd things and then act like it was normal. For instance, a few years ago they stood up during the middle of a family dinner, raised their hands like a ref holding up a champion boxers hand, and announced that they were moving to “The Lake” before sitting down.No mention of which lake this was, no additional context, nothing. After what felt like an eternity as we all stared at each other awkwardly, my wife’s father asked “Which lake?” which prompted his sister to begin bawling her eyes out and screeching about how we weren’t being supportive.More recently my wife and I bought a house in the same city as her parents. And so for the first time, we decided to host Christmas. The grandparents and parents are getting old, and we thought it would be a nice gesture. We made sure to send the invites a month in advance and followed up by text message with everyone who said they were coming.The only thing we asked was that people not bring their pets. My wife has absolutely terrible dog allergies (to her own dismay as she desperately wants to foster a dog) and her aunt and uncle have a history of doing things like showing up with a literal pack of dogs they happen to be petsitting “last minute” for.The email was very clear on this.Cue Christmas Day and my wife’s aunt and uncle showing up two hours late with their brand new Mastiff. When I opened the door, the dog started going nuts and howling, while her uncle scolded it to stop. I tried to politely explain that this wasn’t acceptable and that they needed to leave, but my wife’s aunt started crying and screaming about how mean I was being.Eventually they left, but on the day of and for the last few weeks since I’ve gotten mixed reactions from family and friends. I’m not on Facebook, but apparently my wife’s aunt made a long post about how we ruined Christmas by forcing (?) them to drive two hours for Christmas dinner, only to turn them away heartlessly because they didn’t feel comfortable leaving their new dog at home alone.Our immediate family is supportive. Both of my wife’s grandmas thought the scene was hilarious, apparently, and my in-laws thought it was nice to finally see someone stand up to “the loony tunes duo” (their term, not mine), but think we should have found a way to allow them to stay even with the dog. The other aunts, uncles, and cousins think we went too far and should have compromised somehow.I feel like I’m taking crazy pills, so I have to ask. Am I the asshole?EDIT: It has been pointed out that my spelling of bawling was incorrect. It has been fixed.EDIT 2: There are a number of folks wanting to know more about ”The Lake”. I was trying to not tell this story, since it would bias things towards them looking even crazier (and I wanted the Christmas dinner situation to be judged fairly on its own), but here’s the deal.My wife’s aunt and uncle have always wanted to own a lake house. They literally had framed photos and posters all around their house of different lake front properties. We all knew this for years.What we didn’t know was that they were actively looking. Nor did we know they had put on offer on the one that, in their mind, was their dream lake house.However, they believed that they had been keeping everyone in the loop. This meant when they stood up and triumphantly announced their success, they thought we were going to cheer and congratulate them. So when my wife’s dad asked which lake, it was like him (and everyone else by extension) forgetting about/not giving a damn about them achieving their dream.After my wife’s aunt calmed down, we finally got them both to explain why they were so upset. Except they couldn’t provide any documentation of having told anyone.They hadn’t spoken to anyone in the family by phone since before they put the offer in. They also didn’t have any text messages, emails, or even Facebook posts showing they had told us. What we gathered by the end was that they had told a mutual family friend and somehow expected us to know by extension.So yeah, there’s the story of “The Lake”.",

	"body" : "The long and very short of it, is my sister recently got diagnosed with HIV. As far as I’m aware, this is from a hookup that she no longer has access to and was from a consensual encounter.She came to me on Sunday, cried about the results and while I responded with sympathy, my reaction wasn’t severe. I asked if she still had valid insurance and she said yes, so I said she’d be fine and that the worst of it is over then.She called me heartless and said I had no idea how ruined her life is. I kind of shrugged at her and said she just needed to adhere to treatment and she’d be fine. Again, this set her off and she called me an evil bitch because I didn’t see how awful her life was about to be. And I admit, I may have been crass and said “I don’t see how a mildly steep copay is going to kill you?”. She was very angry with me and left me to sit on the interaction. My mom and dad are upset that I wasn’t as sympathetic with her because she truly does feel as though her life is over and at the end of the day, it’s still a big deal. AITA for how I responded?Edit: I don’t blame my sister AT ALL, for her diagnosis. No one should expect to get a disease from a single encounter and I don’t think it’s earned or justified by any means.I LOVE my sister. She is my only sibling and I helped raise her, and while this situation isn’t perfect or ideal I still love her very much.And my response was based in logic, it didn’t come from a place of hatred or resentment. I just thought logic would help.Please stop asking if I am autistic, that’s really not relevant.200 comments and 2 hours later, I already see where things are going.I love my sister to death, and I’d do anything for her. And she needed me to be her rock and I was a little too solid and literal with her.I called her and explained my side and even linked the post to her, we cried over FaceTime and I told her I was so very sorry for making her feel like she didn’t have any support.I’ll be accompanying her to her  follow up next week. She needs to know she’s loved and cared for right now so that’s what I’ll do for her.And for the strange amount of you who are asking if I am on the spectrum or assumed it and to the one person who sent me a test, yes I am.Post mortem - My final thoughtsMy sister has read your comments, and she appreciates the kindness. She is feeling better, we have been helping her figure out her next steps. In this case and in our state, the state health department is going to help her press charges because after contacting the person she was involved with, they were aware of the situation and proceeded anyhow.To the comments that asked about symptoms or how she knew; fatigue, long lasting flu symptoms and swollen lymph nodes. But you should always get checked, know your status. Not only to protect yourself but to protect others. And if possible, start PREP.To those of you who feel as if HIV is a deserved punishment, I honestly hope you can be perfect all of the time and never have any lapses in judgement. I hope you can tell when people are lying or being dishonest and be that much better than the rest of us.I have a weird amount of Vulcan and robot comments and I’d like to laugh? But also say I’m very hurt to be compared to Spock, I prefer T’Pring.",

	"title" : "AITA for making my friend's cat lose weight while she is in my care?",
	"body" : "My friend's cat Juno has always been massive. Well beyond the level of a usual \"oh that cat is kinda fat\"—she was an absolute tank and she is not even a large breed, just a standard regular cat. Whenever someone would point out that she was bigger than she should be, my friend would get annoyed and insist she is just that way and is perfectly healthy.My friend started a global mobility assignment at her job that involved living in Europe for a year, and she asked me if I would take care of Juno while she was gone, which I agreed to.She walked me through all the cat care matters before she left and told me that Juno was free fed and I just needed to keep her feeder topped off so that she could access dry food at any time. The feeder wasn't on a timer, it was just a bottle that dispensed food with gravity whenever the tray got empty. I told her that I really wasn't comfortable letting her have constant access to food at her weight. She said (paraphrasing here) \"Look, she's still my cat and you don't get to make that call. Either tell me you're going to stick to the plan or tell me you won't and I'll find someone else.\" I agreed, but admittedly I wondered I would be able to follow through on my word for a whole year.I lasted...maybe a week? Having Juno around all day every day made it extremely clear how much she was suffering because of her weight. She struggled to even hop up on my couch. I took the feeder away and started feeding her 1 can of wet food in the morning and 1 can in the evening. I work from home, so the adjustment period of constant yowling for food was an absolute nightmare, but...it worked. She is now 14 lbs after 8ish months on the \"my way or the highway\" diet and its much more energetic and mobile. Even her breathing sounds better.My friend has started to notice the weight loss in the photos that I've been sending her and is extremely upset that I went behind her back after I agreed to the free feeding. She demanded that I go back to the old way. I said honestly...I'm sorry but I really don't think I can bring myself to do that. I was like, I know that when she is back with you that you are going to do what you will, but while she is under my roof I can't just let her gorge herself on food all day when it's clear that she can eat normally and lose weight, that would be neglect.My friend called around to see if any other friends or family would take her for the remaining 4ish months, but no one could/wanted to. She is extremely upset with me and says that when she is back in the US, she is taking her cat back and this friendship is over. It hurts, but I accept it. I know I went back on my word and it must feel very  bad for my friend to be across the world with this situation totally out of her hands. But I don't know if I can bring myself around to thinking that I actually did something morally wrong. I welcome any and all feedback—lay it on me.",

I have met Ted briefly once as him and Sara have been together for a month.Recently we have been distant, as Sara has blown off our plans or cancelled them last minute, for me to see on social media that she went to do something with Ted instead. This upset me, as I moved further away for my husband’s job, so us meeting up isn’t a last minute plan, and made weeks beforehand as I’m far but also pregnant so I have to find pub lic transport as my husband takes the car to work.After Sara flaked a second time to hang out with Ted, I told her how I felt about her blowing me off and Sara apologised and offered to help plan my baby shower to make up for it.

	"title" : "AITA for refusing my SIL in her request to baptize her child during our wedding?",
	"body" : "I dated my fiance for five years before we tied the knot. I have a great relationship with his parents and siblings....except one of his sisters. The Golden Child of the family. She's annoying, but whatever it's fine, I've been able to keep out of her way for the most part as her family lives out of state.So my boyfriend and I got engaged and everything is going great planning with both sides of the family. Until SIL at the last minute requests that she and her family baptize their daughter during our ceremony! She'd even called our priest and he'd agreed to combine the ceremonies! Ummm, What?  I said no for several reasons - none of which were good enough, and I was apparently being \"unreasonable and selfish.\"My reasons:-We're Catholic and weddings are usually an hour, tacking on a baptism would either make the ceremony longer OR take time away from our ceremony.-Our wedding was an evening affair and the reception was only going to be about 2 hours so even if it lasted 30 min (baptism and their photos afterwards) that would cut our reception down to an hour and a half. (Her wedding/reception was an all day affair FYI)-The baby would be in the church, in the wedding photos, and at the reception so seriously who would focus on another wedding couple when there's a first grandchild nearby?Her reasoning:-All the family would already be gathered (for our wedding) and it'd be a good time for them (her family) to have it. And shouldn't I be accommodating to a first time mother!!!!-They'd only invite about 4-6 additional people (to our wedding) ((strangers to us)) and it'd be easier on them because we'd already have the venue and food for their short guest list (((which we'd be paying for))).-It's the fist grandchild and important to the HER family (I guess I wasn't a part of it yet and not included in this sentiment?)My fiance didn't have a strong preference either way but supported how I felt on the matter. I stuck to my guns and said no but we offered a compromise. We said we'd DELAY our honeymoon trip and they could have the baptism the next Sunday morning during Mass. I thought it was a great compromise! But SIL was not thrilled. So that's what we ended up doing but she still brought baby girl, in full white satin lace, to the wedding and was front and center in all the photos. And they brought their 4-6 extra friends to our reception without asking first. We never made a fuss about it.My issue is this, I STILL get crap from this SIL and it's been a couple years since the wedding. Snippy remarks made when it's only the two of us around, passive aggressive comments in front of others, Bridezilla labels tossed my way, a cold shoulder when I try to talk to her at holidays, etc. Like seriously, it was years ago and she basically got what she wanted so why am I being treated like I was an AH? AITA??Edit to address repeated questions:When this first came up, I said no. My husband took over handling this completely from there. He worked with his mom and sister. I didn't have to deal with anything besides initially saying no - husband was point of contact after that. Granted we didn't know she'd still show up with her guests to the reception (or knew what her daughter was dressed in) but at that point we were having a good time at our reception and were focusing on ourselves. I only figured out she'd invited her friends when I saw the photos later. I don't know if she ever offered to pay because I wasn't in the conversation at this point. It happened right before our wedding and hubs and MIL didn't want me to stress out.It was a short evening reception with a buffet. We had about 200 people total.Her passive aggressive comments in the following years were very subtle. If she said something rude and if I or my husband called her out on it (which he did ) she'd claim we simply misunderstood her. The rude comments or snubs she gave me directly in private she'd also claim I misunderstood her - or was blowing an innocent comment out of proportion. My husband has stood up for me but our interactions with her are brief and only once or twice a year so I'm not dedicating a lot of time to trying to have a great relationship with her. She's a narcissist and I REFUSE to give her any drama to feed her addiction.It just struck me as odd that she's hung onto this incident for so long and I began to question if I might have inadvertently been the A hence this post.",

	"body" : "About three years ago, my stepsister Daphne got pregnant. She and her husband Jim were thrilled, but found out at the 20 week scan that the baby had a congenital condition and would be born severely disabled (apologies if these are insensitive terms, I am not sure how people prefer to say it?). Daphne decided to keep going with the pregnancy despite Jim’s protests and they split up, but got back together by the time their son Liam was born. He is now 2 years old.Over the last two years, Daphne’s (and Jim’s) mental health has declined significantly. Daphne used to be a positive and pleasant person, but now it’s impossible to have a conversation with her. She is malicious, envious, and flies off the handle at any perceived slight. When I was having my child, I didn’t speak to her for most of the pregnancy because of how bitter and narcissistic she was. We don’t live close to Daphne so rarely see her in person, but I heard she was getting worse from our parents. In early November, Daphne had a mental breakdown. She trashed Liam’s room completely and vandalised Jim’s car in a fit of rage. This was enough to finally get her moved up the waiting list for mental health services and she started therapy. She reached out to me during this time and we had a few conversations and I invited her and Jim to visit my husband and I for a vacation at our beach house in March.Then we saw Daphne and Jim over Christmas and it was awful. Daphne could keep herself in check for a couple of hours, but then she would revert back to her old self. She would swear constantly, and while I know Liam can’t understand her, I think swearing at kids isn’t okay. Whenever I expressed concern for her she would just snap that I need to get off my high horse about having a “perfect” child. Jim was snapping at her constantly. He would also constantly ask to hold or play with my child, to the point it got annoying. Overall, the whole Christmas break was just the whole family being anxious over the situation.My husband finally said a week ago that he didn’t want Daphne and Jim visiting, and I agreed. I called Daphne and said that something had come up with my husband’s work and we needed to cancel the trip. Daphne was furious. Apparently her therapist had been saying how good this break would be for her (they haven’t been on vacation since having Liam) and I owed her this one thing to help her. Eventually she gave up and said I was a horrible person for pulling the rug out from under her and hung up.I feel bad if I’m derailing her recovery, and even my parents think I shouldn’t have cancelled, which is making me rethink things. They saw how absolutely horrible she was to me over Christmas, they saw how obsessed Jim became with my child, and they still think I should have put that aside, and they’re not normally the “keep the peace” people, so maybe I really am in the wrong.

We visited on football night, so my grandfather, my dad, and Uncle Jerry were trying to watch the game. Bad news: whatever my Grandpa uses to get his channels on his TV failed.Uncle Jerry said we could use Peacock to watch it, but since they don't have an account they'd need to pay for it.

I then told her \"If you don't want to see Freddy every time you open Peacock, get your own account.\" and stopped responding. Aunt Melinda isn't a particularly vindictive person, so I think that's why she didn't respond directly to me after that.Later on, I got a call from Dad asking what happened, and I had to explain. He wasn't mad per se, but wasn't exactly proud.Here's everyone's position:Aunt Melinda: Wants me to apologize and change my profile pic.Uncle Jerry: Says I should consider doing it for Aunt Melinda and the boys.Dad: Says that I have a point and that it's my prerogative, but says there will be an impact.Maria: Says that since I'm the one paying for the account, I have the final say.Mom: Told me I wasn't in the wrong at all and I should change my password and sign out of all devices that aren't mine.I am mentally at a stalemate personally.

However he likes to tell people he did it without any help and saved up all by himself. This it’s technically true, he did save the money by himself, but he also got help in that his parents let him live at home rent free and food free for years so he could save. He was able to save £30k in 2 years because of this!He was having some friends round (not a housewarming) and bragging about how he saved up all by himself and ‘didn’t just get a handout like some people’ whilst also looking at me. I was really shocked by this as, due to the housing market right now, everyone I know has had some help from family in order to buy homes, even those in couples.I basically said back what I said in the title and pointed out he lived at home rent free for years, so he did get help from his parents. One of his friends agreed with me, my bf got angry and the night ended shortly after. Once everyone left he told me I was an asshole and embarrassed him infront of his friends.So am I TA for this?Edit to address things that keep coming up: Yes he was deliberately looking at me when he made the comment, everyone could tell.He paid for nothing whilst living at home, no rent, no contribution to gas and electric, no council tax, he did not pay for food. He bought himself a newer car because he didn’t like the family one he was able to use.He bought at the end of November, housewarming was in December. This was not the first time he had made comments like that but the first time he had intentionally looked at me whilst making them.Edit: SpellingAfter university I house shared and rented for 5 years, I saved some money but nowhere near enough to buy because of the cost of renting. I said in comments and will say again I wouldn’t have my home if not for my grandma because of the housing situation in the UK right now.And to the person who said I let my grandmother die so I could have her money.

I’m the breadwinner and Anne the SAHM; now she’s the housewife after our youngest moved out last year.What’s changed is that she says she’s ‘owed’ for raising our kids and taking care of the household. She wants more personal time, less work around the house, and so I’ve basically taken over almost all the housework, cooking three meals, cleaning the house. I’m still working a full-time job, and I never slacked on chores that I did, such as the gardening, hard-lifting, etc., and I was never an absent father.I bore with it for the past year, but she’s gotten more abusive, outright berating me in front of the kids when they visit that I’m only good for my strength and don’t think about the household at all, while she is doing less of the household work. It’s gotten to the point that I just want to relax in the car for a good solid minute because I only know there’s a long list of things to do.Last night, she went out with her friends, while I slept early for work. This morning, I looked for the car keys for over 30 minutes, which were not in the drawer we always put them in. I woke her up to ask where she put, and she just grumbled at me to find them myself before going back to sleep. I ended up finding it in her handbag and got to work late.I got home today to her screaming at me for invading her privacy by going through her handbag. I tried to tell her that she told me to find them myself, but she kept cutting me off saying I should have known better than to dig through her personal belongings. That she has rights, and I should respect them and to wait for her to wake before getting her to find the keys herself.It was when she said she didn’t care if I was late to work that I lost it. Her exact line was, “It’s not like we’re needing that stupid money anymore.” I yelled back at her that she was entitled and selfish, and that the only reason she’s able to enjoy her current time is because of my stupid money. That she’s been having it far too easy the past year, and if she wanted to see what she’s owed, she can go back to either working, or doing all the chores she’s dumped on me.Anne was shell-shocked that I yelled back at her. The rest of the night was quiet, and she locked herself in our bedroom and hasn’t come out. I’ve called our kids, and told them what happened. My daughter agrees with me, but son says that I may have been too harsh to call her entitled, and implied that I undermined her efforts all those years as a SAHM. They’re going to take turns calling Anne, but I now wonder if I may have been overboard with yelling at her about taking it too easy.Daughter has suggested couple therapy, and said that she’s going to suggest it to Anne as well. I’m more than willing to do so, as today’s encounter made me reflect that I’m getting extremely tired and weary of this life.",

	"body" : "Throwaway and on mobile. My (55M) partner and I (39F) have been together for 11 years. He currently is on a travel assignment for work so we are not in the same city. His daughter (28f) called him yesterday and told him she was pregnant. He was overjoyed and then he called me with the news. The first words out of my mouth were, \"what about her job and insurance?\" Mind you, she has a job and insurance, and has always worked to be able to take care of herself (her partner also has a job/insurance). I said those things because my mind jumped immediately to thinking about where/how they may need help. It was not my intent to imply that his daughter was incapable of supporting a baby or \"trash\" because she did not plan for this baby. I am happy for her as long as she is happy. My partner is very upset as my response ruined what should have been one of the happiest moments of his life as he never thought he would have grandchildren. He suggested I post here to get unbiased opinions on my reaction. So guys, AITA?Edit: Hi! Post has been up for a little over 24 hours and I am not surprised at all by the judgement. I'm trying to go through all the comments as there has been constructive feedback from people on both sides. A few things - my partner and I both work in healthcare with roles that are paid similarly so no sugar daddy situation here. He is also extremely stoic in his every day life so my reaction is even worse when taking into account that he doesn't often express his joy/excitement. I left out a lot of other information/background because it really doesn't matter. Ultimately, I should have shared in his joy and then waited to see if my help was needed/wanted. I reached out to my stepdaughter and in full transparency told her about my initial reaction and we had a great conversation about it. She has forgiven me. I have also apologized to my partner who has also forgiven me. I will take what I have learned and apply it to not be such an asshole in the future. Thanks for all of the replies!",

	"title" : "AITA for insisting that my in-laws buy my daughter a new doll?",
	"body" : "This past Christmas, my mother got my daughter \"Amy\" (4F) a doll she'd been asking for. It's a baby version of Mirabel, from the Disney movie Encanto. It quickly became her favorite.My husband's cousin \"Nat\" has a daughter I'll call \"Julie\" (6F). I wouldn't classify her as \"spoiled\", but she does have a tendency of disobeying other people.There have been numerous occasions in which I asked Julie to do something (\"please sit down\", \"please don't touch that\", etc.) and she either ignored me or went behind my back to do the opposite. While I understand that she's a child, Nat rarely makes any attempt to educate her daughter or correct her behavior.Last week, Nat and Julie came to visit us with some other relatives. Julie saw the Mirabel doll and asked my daughter if she could play with her. Amy refused. Julie protested, but I spoke with the girls and managed to get them to play with other toys.Some time later, the kids sat down to watch TV while me and the others got dinner ready. When we went back to the living room, Julie was gone. After a short search, we found her in my bathroom. She had taken not only the Mirabel doll, but also my nail polish carrying case.Julie had used my nail polish to paint the doll's hair, face and dress. It covered most of her facial painting, matted her hair and ruined her clothes. Amy saw what happened and was devastated. When we asked Julie what she was doing, she said she was giving the doll a makeover.Nat and Julie left in a hurry. The next day, I asked Nat what she planned to do about it, she suggested that the girls apologize to each other (Julie for painting the doll; Amy for not sharing it in the first place) and \"hug it out\", and offered to give me a couple new bottles of nail polish.I made it clear that Amy didn't need to apologize, and while I didn't care about the nail polish (they cost $4 and Julie didn't empty the bottles she used), I did expect Nat and her husband to replace the doll.Nat refused. She said that it wouldn't be fair for her to waste money over an \"innocent mistake\" a child had made. She also doesn't think Julie should be the only one apologizing, as none of this would have happened if Amy had agreed to share in the first place.I asked her twice, she said no both times. Finally, I called her husband and explained the situation. He apologized profusely and agreed to buy Amy a new doll. He stopped by on Saturday and gave it to us. He also brought Julie along and made her apologize to Amy.Apparently, Nat and her husband fought over this, as she kept insisting that Julie was just a child and they owed us nothing. So now, in addition to saying it was entitled of me to expect a new doll, she is blaming me for their fight.My husband is on my side, but my MIL thinks I should apologize, as this has blown out of proportion and I could have dealt with it more gracefully. She also thinks it was wrong of Amy to refuse to share.AITA?",

	"body" : "Yeah I know it sounds weird - obligatory on mobile.So I was on a 5 hour train journey today and I took my knitting with me, and the lady next to me spends her time trying to talk to me (this was my alone time listening to a podcast and knitting) telling me all about how in her home country knitting is taught in schools and how my technique is wrong and how I should let her do it and help me.This is my alone time so I just say \"I'm fine doing it my way\" and keep going with my pattern open on my phone. She is literally begging me every time I move slightly or readjust to let her knit a row. If you don't know much about knitting then you know that different people have different knitting tensions and I knit very tight, someone coming in and knitting a row looser would destroy the 18 hours work I've put into this piece as I'd have to unpick and loosen the previous row.Anyways, I nipped to the loo the first time and I come back and my stuff isn't how I left it, she admits that she was going to knit more but the lady opposing us (we were on a table of 4) told her not to, and when I got my work I realised that she'd moved the stitches and they weren't in the correct order. I fixed this and carried on. I went to nip to the loo again and got to the end of the carriage and saw her reaching for my knitting stuff so I took it with me, and did so every time I went to the loo after that.She kept getting in my space and critiquing me and not leaving me alone. I ended up snapping \"If you wanted to knit you should have brought your own knitting and not be trying to do mine. F off\". She started crying and moved seats. I may have been harsh but this was 3 hours or her being over my shoulder and touching my stuff after being told no. AITA?EDIT Thank you for all the kind responses, people were asking, why didn't I move earlier? The train was full. How often do I need to go to the loo? I went to the loo 4 times, I currently have an eye condition where I need to put in drops every hour and they leave an awful taste in my mouth so I end up drinking a lot of water, I went through my 2L bottle of water on the train.",

Sorry this update took so long, but I just signed the last of the divorce papers and wanted to share with this sub. I took the top comment's advice and tried to have a conversation with my ex-husband and his mother, but they both just yelled at me and would not listen to anything I said. My ex-husband even went back on his agreement to not invite her over -- apparently, this was my punishment for disobeying him and embarrassing his mother.For a few months, I stayed with my best friend on the weekends, and she convinced me to divorce him. But because I was a SAHM, I needed a steady source of income. Early 2023, we started a candle making business on Etsy. It was really rough the first few months, but we began to gain traction and I finally told my ex that I wanted a divorce after I felt financially stable. He said no, but I had already worked everything out with my lawyer. After I sent him the papers, he and his mother began harassing me and he said that he would agree to the divorce only if I gave up full custody of my daughter. Long story short, this ended up in us going to court, and I now have full custody.My best friend is the real hero of this entire story -- she let me stay over for free throughout the proceedings and helped me care for my daughter. With the alimony and the money I made from the candle making business, I officially moved in with my best friend and began paying her rent, too. I'm currently saving up to buy a place of my own. My daughter and I are really happy right now, and I can't believe that I didn't see how toxic my ex and his mother were for the 7 years we were married. I hope this is enough drama for the rest of my life, and thanks to all the people in my dm's who showed me how toxic my relationship was!",

	"title" : "AITA for confronting my SIL that she was trying to make our wedding a showcase for her kids?",
	"body" : "My husband and I recently got married and I felt that my SIL tried to make our special day about her kids.I proposed to my SIL's kids if they could be our flower girls for the special day. The kids were so excited and said yes! Everything seemed to go according to plan until two months before the wedding when my SIL asked me if the kids should have two dresses for two entrances (wedding ceremony & dinner reception). I told my SIL that the kids will only have one entrance, as our flower girls, during my wedding ceremony. My SIL looked upset and said \"they MUST walk during the dinner reception too.\" Note that my wedding ceremony and dinner reception was at the same location and the wedding aisle was long (85ft long) so it takes some time to get from one end to the other (especially for kids).I am not the confrontational type, so I asked my husband to tell his sister that her daughters will only walk down the aisle once. My husband agreed and told his sister. My SIL disapproved and said to my husband that he is the kids' only beloved uncle and that her daughters will never get a chance to be flower girls again.I thought everything was sorted out... until the big day. The wedding ceremony went as should and the flower girls were so beautiful; however, when the dinner reception time came and my husband and my entrance to the dinner reception was about to happen, the SIL inserted her kids in front of us with fresh baskets of rose petals. The SIL never told me nor my husband about this entrance.I was blindsided. Turns out that my SIL went behind my back and told my MOH to tell the wedding MC (emcee) to announce the flower girls first to the dinner reception. The flower girls entered the dinner reception laying out a fresh set of rose petals down the aisle once more. While I was surprised, I was not angry (nor sad) because it was a special day and I did not want to let bad emotions ruin the day. I was also going to let the MC introduce and thank the flower girls during the reception anyways, so I did not mind.This quickly changed when my SIL planned a surprise dance by the daughters in the middle of dinner as a gift to us. The MC once again announced the flower girls and they started dancing down the aisle onto the main stage again. So, all in all the kids \"walked\" down the aisle not once, not twice, but three times! My husband and I were supposed to have our first dance during this time, but instead her daughters danced on the stage, while my husband and I had our first dance on the side...After the wedding I told my husband how upset I was at his sister and said she was trying to make the day about her kids. I confronted my SIL about this, but she shrugged it off and said that they were just kids and I am being a bridezilla/an a-hole. Instead my husband apologized on her behalf, which angered me more since it was not his fault.AITA for confronting my SIL that she was trying to make our wedding a showcase for her kids?",

Dena has two best friends, Shana and Samantha who live in different states.Last month Shana asked my wife if she wanted to run a half marathon in Vegas. When Dena brought up going to Vegas I said half-jokingly that I had never been to Vegas and she can't go twice before I had gone once. She asked if I meant it. I said yes. So she was like ok I guess we can work it out. Samantha and Dena's sister ended up going too.I later backed out not wanting to be third wheel to a girl's trip. A few days after I backed out my wife found out Samantha's husband Jim is going and asked if I still want to go. I excitedly agreed.A week later my wife asks me \"Hey you're ok with sharing a room with my sister right?\" I said \"No I'm not ok with sharing a room. Why would we share a room?\" She explained that we would share a room with her sister to help save her and us some money. Apparently Shana was going to share a room with Samantha and Jim. I said \"Every single person going on this trip makes six figures other than your sister. Why would we share a room to save money? Why doesn't Shana share a room with your sister? Why would we give up our privacy to save money?\" My wife was not having it and we faught over it but didn't resolve anything.The more I thought about it the more it upset me. We don't go on enough dates. We've never been away from our kids for more than one night. Why would she feel ok with removing any chance at intimacy during a 4 day trip away from the kids?A week later I asked her thoughts on our Vegas trip. She explained that we wouldn't be spending any time in our room together anyway. Her last girls trip they never spent any time in their rooms. They only used their rooms to crash. This is a girl's trip and Jim coming along meant I would have someone for me but it didn't change that this was a girl's trip. I argued that having our own room and privacy doesn't change the trip at all.  Not sharing a room wouldn't change the dynamics of the trip but it would at least create the opportunity for there to be intimacy between us and that that was important to me. Again she wasn't having any of it. During the argument my wife admitted that she had agreed to share a room before she had even asked me. She said someone had suggested it in their text thread and she replied \"I don't care\".We didn't talk for a couple days after that fight. When we warmed back up to each other she told me that she had told the group we wouldn't be sharing a room any longer.She thinks I am the AH because I forced my will on her. I think she is the AH because she agreed to share a room without consulting me, tried to sell me on why that was ok, and ignored the importance of intimacy in our relationship.AITA",

	"body" : "My daughter's father and I separated when she was less than 1 year old and it was a messy divorce, he tried very hard to have full custody and did everything possible to ruin my image in front of the judge.The judge didn't agree, because she was very young, weekend visits were established and when she turned 1.5 years old, she became a 50/50 guard and has remained that way to this day (she is 3 years old).We didn't have a healthy co-parenting,  but we are slowly improving and  currently have a friendly relationship  our daughterIt was established in the guard that the holidays would be divided equally. Last year, on 2 different holidays that would have been mine, he talked to me asking if could stay with our daughter, as his family was going to get together at a house with a pool and he would like her to go. I agreed and didn't mind exchanging it for one of his Sundays, but obviously I would have liked to spend it with my daughter because in one case it was a \"2 day\" holiday. I never asked for this.At Christmas, my family would go to the beach from the 23rd to the 26th and this year on Christmas Eve/Christmas our daughter would stay with him. In November, I asked if we could change it for the new year, because it would be a family trip, etc. and I would love to take her* .He immediately said no and that he already had plans, going back and forth, I reminded him that I did the same for him several times and he would be doing me a lot of help, he responded with it's just go with our custody agreement , let's follow it. I didn't say anything else, but I decided that if we're going to follow the custody agreement the way he wants, I don't see the point in always compromising myself if he won't do the same for me.Next month there will be a holiday of mine and he sent me a message, saying the same thing as the other times he asked and I said I wouldn't change it, as it was my day with her.He started to insist, saying that we exchanged it for a holiday or Sunday, but I stood my ground even more because it was a great holiday for me with more free days and it was the only one I insisted on having for that reason.He didn't like it, saying I should be more committed. I had my limit and made it very clear that we were to respect our custody agreement.This exploded, saying that I was being petty towards him for Christmas, being that it is an important holiday and I should understand that I should be better for our co-parenting.This is not a subject that is at peace, because he is still calling me petty and vindictive, but I don't think it's fair to compromise if he won't do the same.AITA?Some points I made in the comments, but I'll put them hereI don't have Christmas with my daughter, I don't care much about the date and I don't care about keep the New Year. My request was much more for the family trip. Of the 4 Christmases we've been apart, he's kept them all and I've never asked to change that, except last year and I don't want to change this year.He asked for Carnival (basically 4 days - Saturday to Tuesday). Not a minor holiday in my country. I gave up last year Carnival.",

	"title" : "WIBTA for not accepting the condition of shortening my wedding ceremony?",
	"body" : "Hey y'all 29M here. Apologies in advance for mobile formatting issues.A couple of days ago my fiancée (28F) attended my cousin's bridal shower. My cousin's MOH was there and my fiancée interacted with her while my other cousin and her friend were there to witness this interaction. Somehow, the topic came up about our wedding and the MOH's wedding. It was then that my fiancée learned that both our wedding and the MOH's wedding ceremony were going to be at the same church. However, it was revealed that MOH's ceremony was supposed to be at the same time as ours. My fiancée had brought this to her attention and she started becoming upset. She stated they had booked the ceremony a year in advance through her aunt who is the bookkeeper of the church. She also claimed that her father donated a lot of money to the church and because of that, whenever she wanted the ceremony to be, she would definitely have her way. Our ceremony and situation would therefore need to be sorted out on our end because she claimed with confidence that we were somehow wrong in what we believed.After this interaction, my fiancée was also upset and my other cousin and friend felt the MOH was out of line for her attitude and comments. After the bridal shower, we spoke on the phone and she relayed what happened. I too was upset that such things were said as we were seemingly in the wrong. After my fiancée consulted her mom, they decided to call the priest directly the following day in order to make sure what was going on and that hopefully he did not provide us the wrong information or write down the wrong date. After an anxiety filled night and morning, he  confirmed with my fiancée we were in fact the couple set for that date and time.Unfortunately, that wasn't the end of it, as he called a couple of hours later. He told us the MOH'S family reached out to him to also confirm information and that they do not have that day for their ceremony. He then asked my fiancée if we were willing to cut our time and ceremony as we would normally be alloted an hour after the ceremony for pictures and other things we wanted to do in the church. He stressed that he did not want to sway our decision in any way and that he would respect what we decide as it was solely at our discretion. Because of the negative experience we had with the MOH, and the fact that neither her nor her family reached out to us directly, we would not be cutting our time short so that they may have a ceremony on the same day.After speaking with my mom and aunt about what went on, they didn't really support our feelings on the matter. My aunt also said I should be the bigger person and accept the condition so that the MOH could have her ceremony. I'm now conflicted, so WIBTA?Edit: I appreciate all your comments as it definitely helped me to confirm my and my fiancée's feelings on the matter. I also wanted to point out that yes, it was my cousin's MOH and not my fiancée's throughout this entire post. We don't know her at all and barely know the MOH'S fiance. I also wanted to clarify that when we initially tried to book the church ceremony, the priest informed us there were two time slots for that day, one at 11 AM and one at 2 PM. The 11 AM was already taken so we chose the 2 PM and were told it was fine.This discussion occurred in September as our marriage class occurred from May-June. What's baffling to us is that in-between when she apparently booked a year in advance, which would mean May, and all the way until September, she did not confirm her time once or even any time after. If she had confirmed any time before September, we would've known and looked for another church. I will also keep in mind the advice given to have a back up in place in case we do end up strong-armed to relinquish our time.",

	"body" : "Throwaway just in case. My child R (12f) is invited to a sleepover. She has 3 bffs, A (12f), N (12f), and B (12m) (all friends since 1st grade). Since starting middle school they have had regular sleepovers. We have been able to avoid hosting one at Ns house until now.Ns mother, T, is not my favorite person. We live in a U.S. suburb but T and I come from the same area a few states over. We graduated from neighboring HS. My hometown has some vocal bigots and T has echoed some of that sentiment over the years. We are black and R’s friends are white. We live in a well off area. I’m a scientist (PhD) for a government contractor and my husband has a MBA and owns a consulting firm.When we first met T at R’s 7th birthday she “jokingly” asked how we could afford our home and if we were drug dealers…it was awkward but I let it go. It is a lazy stereotype to imply black people with a nice house are criminals. I assumed she was just awkward or nervous. Over the years she has made “jokes” about me being “light skinned”, saying I’m an affirmative action hire, how it is easier for blacks to get into college than whites, etc. I have tried to question her logic but I confront her bs with more patience than she deserves so R doesn’t lose a friend. Part of me hopes that she grows/learns from our interactions.I grew up poor and black around poor white people. I understand that class oppression is real. I am certain T has experienced the oppression of capitalism but that doesn’t mean that I also haven’t experienced it just because I am better off now. I spent most of my childhood living in a trailer park. It was not easy being black and poor in rural America.Bs family are very wealthy and I’ve never heard T say a single thing rude in their home. Although she did initially have ann issue with B taking part in the sleepovers until As mom pointed out that they are kids and B is openly gay. As parents are working class white people. As mom has spoken up a few time when she heard T say racist nonsense. We’ve never talked about it directly but As mom and I have shared a few poignant looks over the years.All of this makes me unsure what R will experience at Ns house. I won’t be there to protect her. N is a kind child. Her and R are close and I trust my daughter to pick good people. I don’t want to punish or isolate N because her mom has problematic views. N doesn’t seem to share her views. N has talked to me about how she wants to be a scientist and asked questions about grad school and my job. My husband agrees with my concerns but doesn’t think anything will happen. I haven’t said anything to R, just that I needed to check our schedule next weekend.I think I’d be an asshole for causing drama and tension between a group of 12 year olds who just want to have a sleepover.

	"body" : "My fiancé and I have 2 kids. We agreed that I'd stay home and care for them until they both go off to school. He'd pay all the bills and such since it'd be a lot cheaper for me to stay home versus sending our disabled child to daycare.I received some money for Xmas from my dad that he told me to spend on myself and the kids. Fiancé found out about this money and asked to borrow it. I told him i didn't really want to since we needed diapers and wipes and other stuff for our kids and I planned on buying those with the money my dad gave me. (My mom ended up buying them as a late gift)Fiancé decided to write out a 'contract' that stated he legally had to pay me back in 2 weeks. I added in that if he couldn't pay it by his own deadline that he'd owe an additional $100 and he agreed to that. He signed the contract and marked it with a thumb print and everything.The first deadline was on the 13th this month. He paid me $5 back of the $125 he owed me by then. The second deadline is the 31st. He's now telling me he just can't pay it back and is saying that partners don't do this. That they're supposed to help each other out etc. I told him it was his idea for the contract and that he agreed to both terms (its even on video of him signing it btw)My thing is, I wouldn't be so pressed about being paid back if the day I lent him the money he didn't decide to buy $60 worth of weed instead of paying his car note like he said he would.He's saying I should be more than glad to help my partner who's struggling. Which I would be. If he wouldn't spend his bill money on weed and the lottery.So I told him either he can pay back the full amount of $225 that he AGREED to paying me or he will get absolutely nothing from me anymore. I have zero income. The money I get is gifted to me by family or on the rare occasion from him. I've been trying to find a work from home job but haven't found one I qualify for yet. And since he doesn't work a regular job I can't just work on his off hours since he doesn't have a set schedule. Some days he works mornings some days he works nights and he doesn't know until the day of or the day before.AITA here?Edit: this got a lot more comments than I anticipated and I'm still trying to read through them all. I saw a lot of questions so I wanted to make an edit to answer as many as I can instead of repeating myself a million times in replies.When he and I had first gotten together he was doing a lot better financially. He wasn't spending his money on weed nearly as much as he is now. He was actually providing at first. Even when we had our first kid 4 years ago he was still pretty good. We planned on stopping at one kid until our oldest was much older so I'd gotten on birth control not long after having our oldest. My birth control ended up failing and I found out I was pregnant too late to do anything about it. At that time things were still doing a lot better than they are now so I figured things would stay good after having our second.When I was still pregnant with my youngest our oldest became disabled. She suffered a terrible fall that drastically changed everything for us. She's been in and out of the hospital more times than I can even count. It was sudden and unexpected. She was already receiving Medicaid so medical bills weren't and aren't an issue thankfully but her disability has still taken its toll on everyone.When he asked to borrow the $125 I told him no at first but he kept insisting that he'd lose his car if he didn't make the car payment. It wasn't until he answered a FaceTime call from his dealer with me sitting next to him that I found out that he had used $60 of the $125 to buy weed. I saw someone say I smoke too in the comments, I don't. I tried weed once when I was like 20 and hated it. I've told my fiancé that I was okay with him smoking as long as it didn't interfere with necessities even before having kids with him. He seemed to be on board with that for years and years then it's like a flip switched. I still don't mind him smoking, just as long as our families needs are met first.I also saw some people suggesting to do Uber eats and stuff like that, I definitely would but we are a one car family and he always has the car when he works otherwise I'd be out there doing deliveries. I have applied for disability for my oldest but the process is still on going so we haven't received payment yet. I do try to do surveys to make a little extra money every chance I get but I'm going to look into the work from home suggestions some of y'all had and try to get one asap.I do receive wic and Ebt so I buy most of the food. He buys anything extra and pays the rest of the bills- or rather he's supposed to. He doesn't tell me much about his finances so I don't know exactly how much money he has coming in and how much the bills are. When I ask him he gets pretty angry so I just drop the subject.A lot of people also suggested I should leave him. I know that's probably for the better but it's hard when you still love someone. He was a great partner for years before we had our first and he was a great father for awhile after having our first. I don't want to just throw that all away.I hope I explained things a lot better.",

	"body" : "I (F 36) have been dating my boyfriend (40) for about a year and a half. A few months ago my mother asked me on a phone call if “we were serious” and planning to get engaged. I responded yes as this is something he and I have discussed and both want. She immediately responded, “that’s great!” Followed with “don’t expect your father and I to pay for anything for the wedding!” Bc she said “we’re too old.” (This will be important later). This was completely unprompted as I had never asked. To this I responded that he and I don’t really want a wedding and we’re not sure what we’ll do after engagement and when it comes time to plan. Her response was that “I better not elope again” and “she expects” “a nice wedding of some kind regardless of the size.” For context: I eloped with my first husband and she was embarrassed and devastated (her words). We ended the phone call by me saying she can’t have expectations if she’s not willing to contribute and that I wasn’t even engaged yet and we’ll talk about it later. My boyfriend and I don’t make a ton of money and probably cannot afford even a small ceremony and wedding dinner for even ten people if we’re being honest. We’re fine. But we don’t have $4K laying around and let’s be honest even with a tiny wedding you’re looking at that amount. Anyways, fast forward a few months and my TWIN (so same age) brother gets engaged. We’re all very excited for him. Last night my mother and I were discussing his plans (as I was trying to get the scoop and my brothers kinda tight lipped about things). She lets it slip on our phone call that they’re planning a large wedding and my parents are footing half the bill, splitting it with the brides parents. I reminded her of our conversation and she immediately called me a jealous brat and ended the phone call. Am I the asshole for being upset?For clarity: my issue is that she’s (my mother) is insisting on a nice wedding of some kind. Insisting with no financial backing. The salt in the wound was to find out she’s paying for half my brothers and won’t admit this is not about “age” as she’d previously said with no explanation just further demands that if I do get married there will be a wedding paid out of my pocket",

I noticed they all had a tight tubular \"mask\" on over their nose and mouth, like a thick sock. It looked pretty uncomfortable for them.My uncle explained that the owners had put \"spit masks\" / \"spit socks\" on all the alpacas before our arrival and it was a common thing, and something he requested all clients to do before an alpaca shearing.The goal is to deter them from spitting (since the spit will backfire) and to make sure you don't get spit on.Well, I didn't think that was a very good justification for something like that. It looked stifling and uncomfortable for them, and the only benefit is avoiding spit?During a break I checked on my phone and it said the only big problem with alpaca spit is that it can stink, it's not like it's harmful or anything. And they seemed well-behaved anyways. I was willing to risk a bit of spit to make the alpacas more comfortable.So while my uncle was shearing, I removed the spit-mask from a couple of alpacas without him noticing. When he noticed, he got really angry and said \"put those back on, what are you doing, do you want to be spit on?\"I said I wasn't too worried about it and I wanted what was best for the alpacas. He said \"you have no clue what you're talking about, put them back on now.\"I didn't see what the big deal was and said if anything it'd be me that got spat on from it, not him. He said \"I'm the one who has to drive you home, do you have any idea what that will be like if it spits on you?\"I didn't do it again but I feel like he was overreacting and it was sort of contentious the rest of the time. We didn't talk much on the ride home and I get the feeling he won't be inviting me to further farm days.It feels petty to me for him to be so worked up about me risking getting spit on (probably not even him) as if I couldn't clean up before driving home, I don't see what the big deal is.

Our other neighbors, Barbara and John (mid-late 70’s) watch the kids so much that the kids think they’re their grandparents.I had a son a few months ago and Danielle has been offering unsolicited parenting advice since before he was born. I’ve tried telling her I don’t need any help and she said something about all new moms needing some help even if we don’t realize it. I finally told her I don’t need any advice from someone that doesn’t parent her own kids and if I need advice I’ll go to the neighbors since they seem to have the kids most of the time anyways. Now she’s got my mom (I live with her) and the neighbors saying I was rude, I don’t understand her situation, and she was just trying to help.Am I the asshole for telling her I don’t need parenting advice from someone that doesn’t parent her own kids?",

	"body" : "I (17f) was at family dinner and my uncle (28m) and his wife (24f) were there. For context my aunt is slightly crazy, she claims to be allergic to everything, and normally I would be okay with the allergies until she told me if she didn't like something she would just say she is allergic to it. When she was asked for a full list of what she was allergic to she said her mom had the list and she didn't know. I immediately stopped caring as much about her allergies.My mom(40) on the other hand is severely gluten intolerant, like if she gets into it she can't move for days. No one on that side of the family will make any food she can eat. They won't even leave croutons on the side of salads for her.I had helped to make my favorite food for dinner, bacon wrapped water chestnuts, and my uncle lost it because his wife is supposedly allergic them. I argued back that water chestnuts are a kind of raddish, not nut and he stopped yelling but they wouldn't touch them. Fine by me, I got more.Later on I was eating a chocolate with Nutella in the middle and I gave my siblings (5 and 6) a piece. My uncle lost it at me saying that my siblings were going to be around his wife and make her sick and put her in the hospital. He was yelling but I didn't care. I said something along the lines of why should we tiptoe around your wife's diet, when she doesn't even know what she's allergic, but you don't even care if my mom is able to eat.My aunt ran out of the room crying and my uncle started yelling at me. My mom got in the way and came to my defense but the a lot of the family is saying I was in the wrong and should just have stopped eating. My mom told me I did nothing wrong and other family said they hadn't realized my mom couldn't eat the food and that they would do better.The family seems torn but I want an outsiders opinion.

	"body" : "This involves me, my friends “Aya” and “Zach.” We are all early 30s and have been friends since high school.Aya was born in China. She was abandoned as a baby and nearly died in an orphanage before being adopted and raised by an American family. Aya considers herself American and is firm that due to her traumatic experience with China, she has no desire to “be Chinese” or explore the language and culture.Zach is also Chinese and the son of wealthy business owners. He is very proud of his culture.Background: A few years ago at dinner, Zach took Aya’s fork and knife and told her she needed to eat with chopsticks. I immediately stopped him and made him give her silverware back, wondering wtf that was about.Later, Aya told me Zach had decided she needed to be “more Chinese” and was pressuring her to engage with Chinese language/culture. Zach apologized, Aya let it go.Current situation: Aya asked me and Zach to help plan her wedding. Zach suggested Aya wear a qipao, have red as a wedding color, no white dress, serve Chinese food, etc.I pulled Zach aside and told him Aya has been very clear she does not want a Chinese wedding, stop forcing it. Please just follow what Aya wants. Chinese culture is lovely, but this is not the time or place.Aya was grateful and thanked me for reining Zach in, because she was having a hard time confronting him. Bridal party and most friends agreed.However, Zach and some others are upset, saying Zach has the right to express his culture and make suggestions, Zach feels lonely and there are not a lot of other Chinese people around, Aya IS Chinese so not a big deal.Now, I’m not anti-Chinese. Zach and I actually met in Chinese class and enjoy doing Chinese cultural things together. I am from a different culture myself. I know it’s hard. When Zach marries, I will support him having a Chinese wedding.But Aya has trauma around her Chinese roots and considers herself American. She DOES NOT WANT Chinese traditions. I support Aya in having an American wedding.I refused to apologize, and Zach is more upset. I understand Zach loves his culture but I don’t think he has the right to push it at Aya’s wedding. AITA?EDIT: Sorry folks, I think I was unclear about it. Aya and Zach are not getting married to each other. Aya is marrying an American and Zach and I are just helping to plan the wedding.",

	"body" : "I female 28 , have been divorced of my daughter father for the last 5 years. My daughter is 6 years old and now has started to have questions as to why her parents aren’t together. I have always told her until I feel that she is mature enough to speak about the conversation we will. But lately the past month she has been asking more and more and finally said well my dad has told me why so I don’t understand why can’t you. Her father 29 male has been speaking to my child and telling her his side of events that lead to us no longer being together. Now my daughter has anger towards me as she thinks I’m keeping secrets from her but I just keep telling her that conversation it between adults and not a child. I have been with my current partner male 30 for about two years and have recently had a new addition to our family. We have always done things together never leaving my daughter out. But as of couple of days she says she no longer loves him as he is the reason her dad and I can’t go back together. But her dad has had a relationship couple of months after our seperation but it seems her father cant do wrong only I. I have confronted my ex husband and the only thing he tells me is that he will not stop answering her questions due to her wanting to know and that he sees no wrong.UPDATE:Thank you for all the advices I have received but to answer two questions as they are being asked numerous times. I might have not worded it correctly 1. The reason of my divorce was due to multiple cheating that happened through our marriage during work trips and out of them 2. In our divorce I didn’t fight for anything as I just wanted our daughter to see how a healthy relationship should be between her father and I not once argued Infront of her.We divorce when she was just 2 years old since the day we both separated she understood as I always told her she appropriate information for her to understand. My ex husband and I had agreed that when she was 8 we will speak about the reason why our divorced happed which obviously that didn’t happen. Our daughter understands what it is to have two homes. And have our significant other in her life and what they represent which she has great relationships with them. I have done everything in my power for this not to affect our child. She understands it was not due to her and that we both love her so much what she is wondering as to why I don’t speak about the conversation is due to my ex saying that he tried to fix our marriage but I didn’t want to and that I left and took her with me. And blamed my current partner as to why mommy and daddy can’t no longer get back together as we have a child. Which I have the right to restart my life but in his eyes I do not have that right. Everything was calm in our divorce until I got married and had another child and which triggered him and started to tell our daughter information that we both discuss as of when it should of been said to her.My partner and I have both agreed that if he doesn’t want to take counseling we will be putting our daughter through it as I do want her to her that it has never been because of her but life took us in different path. She doesn’t hold any hate towards our newborn in the other hand she loves her and is a great big sister. She just feels that I need to be more open to her in certain conversations which I agree but to a certain limit. He father will always be her father but I just want him to understand certain things should involved our child as she is too young. Will be contacting my lawyer in regards to the proper steps I have to take to not allow this to happen once again. As I have done everything in my end to make him understand but doesn’t seem to be enough. I can’t dwell in what if he decides not to do anything until he is ready as this is not about him our I but about our child and what benefits her the most.But once again thank you for all the comments and advice that everyone has given me I do appreciate it.",

	"title" : "AITA for telling my sister her husband stinks?",
	"body" : "Throwaway because this is just embarrassing.I’ll get straight to the point: My BIL does not like showering. My sister has casually mentioned in the past how he showers once every 4-5 days because “he doesn’t really get dirty.”He has extremely strong BO and I don’t think I’ve ever been in a place with him where he did not stink. Even fresh out a shower, you can still smell very strong hints of sweat and…other types of smells when you’re standing near him. People have brought this up with her in the past, and every single time she just shuts them down and says that they’re looking for excuses to hide that they do not like him.One of our mutual friends is getting married in 3 weeks and it’s about 9 hours away from where my sister’s family and I currently live (we do not live together, but we’re about 15 minutes away from one another).My sisters informs me a few days ago that she will be riding with me to the wedding because their car is having some engine issues. None of this was discussed, she just informed me like she was relaying a message.I cannot explain to any of you how much I shiver at the slight thought of being in the same car with her husband for 9 whole hours. He does not like sitting in the back and will most likely ride shotgun. To avoid this, I offered to lend my boyfriend’s car to my sister, as he is out of state for the next few months and will not be using his car. She repeatedly said no, no matter how many times I insisted.So, I decided that the best choice for me is to just book a flight to the location and rent a car from the airport when I land. I have some points I can use to get a discount so it all works out.I tell my sister that I’ll be taking a flight instead of driving, and I told her that she can feel free to use either my car or my boyfriend’s car if she’d like to drive there. At this point, I haven’t booked my flight yet, because I wanted to inform her before I went ahead.She fully blew up on me and demands that I cancel my flight (because she thinks I already booked it) and says that we will be going forward with her plan instead. Continuous arguments led to the truth, where she lets it slip that their car is fine, they just didn’t feel like driving or wasting money on gas and tolls and were just looking forward to a relaxing drive across the country.I was tired of beating around the bush, so I just told her the truth, in a very polite way because at the end of the day, she is my sister and the person I’m talking about is her husband, so there’s no point in being harsh.She gets beyond upset and just blasts me with at least 50 texts about how I’m an A-hole. I feel bad about this but I’m truly conflicted.Edit: I forgot to mention, she is also texting the bride and informing her that she wont be attending the wedding because of me. The bride is now stressed out and keeps contacting my sister for more information but my sister is just icing both the bride and myself out.",

He has three children from a previous relationship.To celebrate my youngest child’s 21st birthday,  I was planning a surprise holiday for us all to Disneyland. I found a great flight deal and was keen to get it booked. Prior to booking the holiday I spoke to Liam on the phone I told him my plan and asked him about his three children from the previous relationship coming. It was decided he’d speak to their mother, who is a very difficult character, to ask her permission. I booked the flight deal for 5, resigned to the fact that the flight cost would increase for the remaining 4 flights.The flights are over the Easter holiday, and Liams Ex has said the children cannot come. She wants to do an egg hunt with them. Liam wants to move the holiday to suit his ex. The dates suit my daughter whose 21st Birthday we are celebrating, and of course the cheap flight deal is a factor also.This has all backfired onto me because Liam is disappointed they can’t go, he says the other two shouldn’t go. He claims I am not treating the family the same, and has completely overlooked the conversation I had with him before booking, and the subsequent messages I have sent regarding an update on the booking.What should have been a lovely surprise for everyone has been ruined by Liams fury at his ex partner.So am I the asshole for booking the deal flights for my children and grandchildren and not waiting for response from his ex about their three children?",

Every year at my highschool they do this big mexican celebration (im in mexico) to clebrate our tradition and shiz, and everyone is mandated to participate in it. They give each grade a little post to sell food and drinks, and they give us a bunch of tickets so we can sell them and fund the party.My (20f) sister went to the same school i am in and put herself as my tutor, wich means shes basically the one the school sends the emails and calls about tuition and stuff like that, so since shes alredy been to about 3 of this partys she knows the gist of it and was supposed to help me sell the tickets, aswell as my (50m) father who  is the one who pays for the tuition. When i told him said \"yeah ill help you sell em\". A month passes and its a week before the party, and i had still not sold any tickets, and i forgot about them cause of exams and they where just collecting dust in my drawer.Thats when my father tells me \"hey you wanna go to seaworld with me n your stepmom?\" Wich to i say \"sure\", but i was on the day of the party, wich i didnt really mind not going to cause its seaworld. After i return, the party is over and i never hear from the tickets again. A week after that, i get told by the principal i need to pay some late fees on tuition n extra stuff (wich i presume where the tickets), i tell my dad and he pays with some troubles from the sales department at the highschool, but it gets resolved.Mind this is in late september, jump to a week ago at the end of the winter break when my sister comes to me saying \"hey, i just got a call from school saying you need to pay for the tickets you had to sell, how many did you sell?\" And i told her \"none, i didnt go to the party, plus, you n dad didnt really help me sell shit\" to wich she gets mad at me for \"not being responsible\" and i tell her \"tf was i supposed to do???\" To wich she responded \"you couldve sold them to your friends\" wich i did try, none of them wanted to get in extra dept. she tells me that we have to pay for the tickets, and i ask her how much is it, SHE SAYS 30 BUCKS PER TICKET. I found the old strip of tickets amd counted 16, wich means at a total it would cost us about 400-500 dollars.now my sister and mom are mad at me for this, and i dont even know if my father knows yet, and i cant sell them now that the party was done 4 months ago, i honestly dont think im the ah in this situation, cause this is the first of this partys i was in and my sister was supposed to help me out, she did nothing, and my father was supposed to help me sell the dang tickets, he also did nothing, i did my part to the best of my knoledge and they did not help at all, now my family is mad at me....so reddit. AITA?Update: i tough i might need to clear up somethings about my situation, so heres a quick notes:i really dont want to just place the blame somewhere else, i believe in consequences for actions, i also see how i have may come across as irresponsible, wich i kinda are, i have no real expirience with this stuffI really couldnt just \"take responsibility\" of selling the tickets, people at school didnt want more tickets, i dont know anyone outside school, and i couldnt sell them around cause i aint allowed to wander around in the streets, also i couldnt sell them online, thats why i needed the help from my family.When i say \"oh i forgot\" i mean that i was in the middle of exam season and had to study for ablut 12 differen exams and projects wich took all my attention at the momentUpdate 2: aight i think to clear up MORE things4. some people seem to think i just got the tickets and didnt even mention them to my parents, and now blame them, and sorry if i told it like that, english aint my first language and its my first time writing a aita story. I did tell my family about my tickets, for about 2 weeks straight, we got the tickets at the start of the semester, i talk to my family about it, then at the end lf the semester i entered exams and thats when i left the tickets in a drawer. i asked them about 7 times in 2-3 weeks before the exams came5. The tickets arent a house to house sale, they literally just give you a bunch of tickets n say \"sell em\"Update 3 and final: well i read alot of your comments and responded to a few, and the situation just got resolvedYES im a ass for not remembering my responsibility YES the school is a ass for giving students over 400 dollars worth of stuff YES my fam couldve help me more At the end of the day im mostly at fault, and i accept itI just talked to my father about the matter and he told me to not worry too much about it, he will pay the fee, and even apologized for not helping me sell the tickets, i also apologized for getting him into this mess, as for my sister i think shes still mad at me, but i think itll blow offThanks for the kinda reality check and for the supportAlso if any tiktokers see this: DO NOT POST THIS STORY, I DONT MEAN THIS AS CLOUT CHASING AT ALL, I TRULY FEAR THIS GETTING BACK TO MY KNOWN ONES OR EVEN THE SCHOOLThanks for reading ",

Due to age difference (and us basically hating that blended family), we were never close to Paul and had little to no impact on his life.Anyway, Paul is getting married to Laura (21) who is a very devout christian and has been pushing him to make an effort to “unite” our family.Laura has been using the wedding to try and get us to play happy family, at first it started with small annoyances like family chats and trying to get us involved in wedding planning.Originally Mike and me were just regular guest in the wedding but Paul asked us (as requested by Laura) to both be his best men, it felt awkward, but Paul never asked for anything, so we accepted.Last weekend we were supposed to go to a seminar (since Mike and I haven’t been to a church in years) to receive training on what to do at the ceremony, however it ended up being a set-up by Paul and Laura.When we arrived there was a Pastor, Laura, Paul, Mike and our parents. We were supposed to spend the weekend “healing” our family. Sara and Dad knew this beforehand and were on board, Mike, and I not so much, so we just left and opted to pull back from being part of the wedding, this upset Paul, he said that if we weren’t going as his best men, we wouldn’t be invited at all.This was acceptable to Mike and me since neither of us went to each other’s wedding.

Today it was me cutting a cucumber, other days he’s had issues with the crunching of bags/making popcorn in his vicinity etc, especially if he’s watching tv, which fair enough…This is a running theme with him, being frustrated or feeling “followed around” when I’m in common areas that he was in first.

We have 1 child together, our son 15M.When my son was little, I would speak to him in Turkish in hopes of raising him bilingual. As a young kid, he learned quick and was fluent but as he grew older, he stopped “liking” Turkish. These aren’t my words, but my son’s. I thought this was just a dumb rebellion thing he would get over soon especially since he’s much closer with his non-Turkish speaking father than me. I was wrong. Going into his teen years he refused to utter anything in Turkish and I stopped pressing the issue.It wasn’t an issue I pressed because I felt that I didn’t need to. He can still communicate with his father and me. My son has never been to Türkiye and we live in a largely White, English speaking rural area in the Southern USA so it isn’t like he needed it for his daily life. My family back in Türkiye is pretty poor too so they never came to visit my family and teach my son to value the culture more. That is, until recently when my parents finally decided to visit my family in a surprise visit (my husband saved some money behind my back to help them with their travel expenses to surprise me.)It’s been amazing finally being able to see my parents after such a long time. My son has had some difficulties communicating with them, however. He can understand what my parents are saying to me 90% of the time but he is not able to speak Turkish to respond to them. My mom is the most frustrated with this. She will scold me for not pressing him as a kid to speak my language and scold my son for not being able to respond to it. It’s a daily thing at this point. My son was able to ignore it at first, now he’s just annoyed and so am I.I asked my mom to leave my son alone. Her frustration in not being able to communicate with her grandson is valid but she has no right to scold him for it. She can scold me all she wants over it, but leave my child alone. My mom, more upset at this point responded by saying that I can’t boss her around, she is my mother, and I have no right to boss her around. This led to a 10 minute long argument at the end of which, I let it die just to enjoy the fact in seeing my parents but I can still tell my mom is angry. AITA?",

A week after I found out I was pregnant, I caught my now ex (24m, we'll call him Adam) cheating on me with his new girlfriend (25f, we'll call her Christine). Adam and I decided to split, but agreed that we would still co-parent.My pregnancy has been rough, since I'm still in college with a job and my parents are less than supportive, but Christine has made it so much worse.The two invite me for lunch every Wednesday to talk about the baby. Christine doesn't let me order what I want because it isn't good for the baby. So the red flags started off very slow and subtle, but they just got worse and worse.I told them what I had planned to name the baby girl. Christine told me is was one of the ugliest names she had ever heard. I explained that it was my great grandmother's name who had passed away the year prior and that she was the woman who inspired me most so I wanted to honor her. Christine keeps picking on the name and so I've thought about maybe changing it.There have been some other really strange things she has done (throwing herself a baby shower for MY baby without inviting me is also at the top), but that one probably hurt the most.Recently while at our weekly lunch, Adam and I were talking about the co-parenting deal. Christine said that she wouldn't take care of the baby since it wasn't hers. I snapped at her and asked why the hell was she constraining all the things I could and couldn't do. I probably wouldn't have been so pissed if Christine hadn't promised that she would love to watch her step-daughter, but she had.Christine and I went off on each other. During our argument, I said that it wouldn't really matter because Adam would probably cheat on her too and so she couldn't be the step-mom to our kid. Christine practically stormed off, with Adam following her. I felt pretty guilty because I find myself as a calm person and I hate getting angry at people.Now weeks later, Christine had told everyone in the town we live in. The majority of my friends have stopped talking to me and I don't really have any support. One of my good friends was Christine's younger brother and so he told all of our other friends.It's been a few weeks and I've been trying to contact both Christine and Adam, but they don't respond. I've concluded that I'm on my own now, but I keep wondering if this is all my fault. I can't help but feel horrible about what I said, the two seemed pretty happy and Christine was a lot better for Adam than I ever was. So there was no reason for me to say that about her. Can I even salvage my relationship or just cut them out of my life?The action I took was yelling at the step-mom of my child.

	"title" : "AITAH for telling someone in a wheelchair that they have to wait their turn for the handicap bathroom",
	"body" : "Recently my family was on a road trip. I have two young children a 10 month old and a three-year-old. My youngest, the 10 month old, is very susceptible to diaper rash. So when it was obvious that he had a dirty diaper, we pulled into a rest stop so that I could change his diaper. When I got the woman's bathroom there was only one stall that had a changing table, and it was the handicap stall. That stall was occupied, so I stood outside of the stall waiting for it to open up. Just as the stall became available, a woman in a wheelchair came into the bathroom and asked that I wait for her to use the bathroom before I use it since she is in a wheelchair. I had been waiting for about five minutes for the stall. My son had a dirty diaper that needed to be changed. He was crying and irritable at that point. I told the woman that, unfortunately, the only stall in this bathroom that has a changing table is the handicap stall and I have been waiting for five minutes to change my son. I told her that I would be quick, and I went into the stall to change his diaper. While I was in there, I overheard the woman telling anybody that she could interact with that I was being rude, and was discriminating against her for her disability, by taking the handicap bathroom from her. It took me about two minutes to change my child's diaper and then I left the stall so that she could use it. As I was leaving the stall, the woman said to me \" I hope you feel good about yourself, taking a handicap stall from somebody that actually needs it\". I reminded her that the handicap stall is also the only stall that accommodates babies with a changing table, and that I had every right to use the stall. She scoffed at me and went into the stall. I don't know why this interaction is bothering me so much. I don't think I was in the wrong. But here I am asking Reddit, AITAH for asking a handicapped woman to wait for me to change my child's diaper?Adding info for some, I didn't think this would blow up like it didYes, I know you can change a baby's diaper virtually anywhere. Our car was honestly not a great option as it was packed full. I could have changed him in the front seat, but I also had to use the bathroom so it made more sense to simply go to the restroom and use the resources there.My husband took our 3 year old to the restroom in the men's room. This is usually how we do it as 90% of the time there is no changing station for baby's in the men's restroom in the USShe did not express any urgency to me. Only that she should have the stall due to her disability. I know it's possible she was too embarrassed to tell me her urgency, this is something I will never know.No I don't use cloth diapers but I will look into this if it is something that will really help his rashes!",

So I assume that would mean he would get home 5:15 to 5:30, right? I guess not because he consistently gets home 6 or later most days. Today I got off early. I was excited because we have no days off together and this meant we would have a little more evening time, assuming he was off at 5 like her keeps saying. I got home at 5:30 only to find out he was still at work. So I called and asked what time he was off. He flipped out and said 5. I said then why are you still at work? He said because he has to close the office, pick up stuff, close the gate, etc. I said then you're still working, so when are you off so I know when you'll be home? I was looking for a answer that would set up realistic expectations going forward. Like \"I have to do x, y, and z but I can't do that until 5 so 5:30 is a more realistic time to say I'm off.\" Pretty much we argued back and forth for a minute with me insisting if he's off at 5 then it's not crazy to expect him home by 5:30 and him arguing that he is off at 5 and he's just locking up for 30 min to an hour. He then asked me if I'm off 6 why I don't get home until 7. I said because my commute is an hour, but I still leave at six.  He keeps insisting this is the same logic. He ended up getting home at 6 and has been ignoring me for an hour and a half because he's busy with his game and insists I need to apologize for asking him what time he is off again. Which I did, and tried to explain that I keep expecting him home based off what he told me and keep getting disappointed. Which just started another argument.So AITA for thinking he should be home 15 to 30 min after he's \"off.\" I could be because maybe I should have just asked what time he was getting home instead of what time he is off again. I'm just tired of being told one thing and then something else happening.Edit: Phew... A lot of you are weirdly triggered by this.  I can see how my post comes across as me being wildly unhinged but I wasn't even the slightest bit upset until he blew up at me when my intention was to just figure out what was going on and I did not do a good job of communicating that to him.Regardless, I apologized for asking him what time he was off hours ago and for not understanding that he had a completely different interpretation of the question than I did. I kept all attempts to explain where I was coming from to myself. And because I have not attempted to talk out the miscommunication  again he is happily talking to me instead of ignoring me.",

	"title" : "AITA for not giving my stepmother my hair?",
	"body" : "I (29f) have been growing my hair out since before the pandemic  and managed to grow it out to halfway down my butt. I've never dyed my hair and I rarely style or blow-dry it so it's very healthy. My natural color is a very uncommon red, I've been told my whole life that it's almost impossible to recreate. It's not an uncommon thing for people to tell me they want my hair.2 weeks ago I finally decided I wanted to cut it short and donate it to Angel Hair For Kids, a company that makes wigs for children fighting cancer and other illnesses. I told my dad I was doing this and when I was doing it and he thought it was a great idea. I ended up cutting off 16 inches and have honestly never felt more like myself with my new haircut. I feel like I finally recognize myself again and for the first time in years feel good about myself.Cut to that same night. I had sent my dad a picture of my chopped off hair at the salon followed by the haircut pics. About an hour later I received a text from my stepmother (71f) who we'll call Jane. She asked if I would consider giving her the hair so she could have it sent out to make a wig for herself.Jane and I have had a very rocky relationship in the past. For 2 years in high school I didn't speak to her or my dad because of an issue that she had caused and never apologized for. We've since moved on and have a better relationship now. She has dealt with major health issues as long as I've known her and within the past 2 years has lost nearly all of her hair. She recently bought 2-3 wigs that look amazing on her. Every time we discussed the wigs she would joke that I should give her my hair since I had so much of it. Well it turns out that I misunderstood and she wasn't actually joking.When Jane asked me for my hair I had already sent it away for donation, which I told her. She didn't say anything about it after that, just asked me for more picture of my haircut which I sent. In all honesty the idea of giving her my hair feels quite weird to me. I imagine showing up to Christmas to see her wearing my hair and it brings up weird emotions about my previous relationship with her when I was younger and she was more controlling.When I saw my dad the following Monday he almost immediately brought up the fact that I had \"donated it elsewhere\" instead of giving it to Jane. I asked if she was upset about it and my dad told me that she was, and that he was also disappointed that I didn't think of her first. It's caused some tension between us and has made me uncomfortable, but it's also really put a damper on the whole experience of doing something good and finally feeling good about myself. I feel like I've done something wrong and selfish now.TLDR; I donated my hair to a children's cancer foundation instead of giving it to my stepmother who is dealing with hair loss and now she and my dad are disappointed in me.AITA here?",

May be don’t shout at people who are considering helping you.” She was like yeah yeah. I didn’t say anything to her and turned to her mother that I am sorry but your daughter needs to learn how to be polite to people when asking for favour. I then turned around and let the security personnel know that they had cut a huge line. The security guy took them aside and made them wait for 15 mins (so that they don’t miss their train, otherwise they would have gone to the end of the queue). I moved forward and passed security. The family in front of me turn around and said you could have let them go and didn’t have to be so rude. The older guy scoffed and was like youngsters while looking at me. Was I the A***ole?ETA I have read everyone’s opinion and I realise that I should never be kind to others at the expense of someone else. Next time if I want to be kind I will keep this in mind. On other note many redditors are commenting that I was being kind and inconveniencing other people. Actually those three ladies had to cross the whole queue and everyone knew that they were rushing to cut the line but not a single person said anything. I was the only one who actually spoke up. However lesson learnt. Those who are curious, I am not from a western country.",

I did not want it to be financially draining for anyone so bought all their bridesmaid’s dresses. One of my childhood best friends (let’s cal her Lea) was also my bridesmaid. I had switched three flights to be there for her wedding and then return just the day after as I was not able to take time off work but did all my bridesmaids duty and maid sure I was there for her wedding no matter what. But when it came for the time of my wedding she wasn’t getting very involved in the planning but would leave random messages to me from time to time to show her excitement. I just assumed that she was really busy and did not think much of it. I was a bit shocked and hurt when she did not show up for my bachelorette. My sister and my MOH told me that she had asked each and everyone of my bridesmaids about their date of convenience and budget before planning my bachelorette and Lea had confirmed her presence but dropped out last minute saying she had an important work meeting. I believed her till I found out that she was actually out on a cousins trip on the same date. This really pissed me off and I confronted her. She never gave a proper explanation and just became really defensive. I left the matter there as I did not want to ruin my wedding and chose to give her the benefit of the doubt. I had a grand music night a day before my wedding. She was there for it and everything seems normal. The next day in the morning when I called all my bridesmaids to my room for the final bridal entry practice, I found out that Lea had already left because she needed to attend another wedding. I was very upset. I was anyway in the bridal mode and it really effected my mood. I also had to make some last minute changes to the bridal entry. Later when I confronted her after the wedding, she wasn’t apologetic at all. She simply told me that she had to also attend her husband’s cousins wedding and since she was already there for one wedding related event it shouldn’t be a big deal that she missed my actual wedding since I would anyway be busy on the day of my wedding and wouldn’t get time to interact with anyone. I asked her why she did not tell me earlier, I wouldn’t have bought her the bridesmaid dress and wouldn’t have planned things keeping her in mind. She said that she did not want to upset me and thought it’s best if she leaves without telling anyone so that she is not “emotionally manipulated” into staying. Since then I have been avoiding her. I had a lot of love for her but I just feel so betrayed that all the love seems to have evaporated. Some people things that I am being petty and I should just forgive her. So, AITA?",

Example, never leave any thing in his car. If you go inside with a full and and groceries and leave the receipt by accident, it’s a problem, even if it’s a once in a while things where you forgot.Another one of these things is his parking spot in the drive way. My brother (18) lives with us. My husband and I both pay for everything equally. And my brother moved in due to unfortunate circumstances from not having reliable parents. He’s generally never home due to always being at work and when he is we usually don’t see him pass the catching up.My husband have asked my brother in the past to stop parking in his spot in the driveway and to park on the street 5 feet from our mailbox. And he will continually correct him if either of these rules are broken. Recently my husband and I got home from his sisters roller derby game, found my brother and his spot. My brother had stated that he was just pulling in real quick to drop us off some food on the counter and he was about to leave. But my husband wouldn’t have any of it. And stated that he (my brother) is to never park in his (my husband) spot no matter the circumstance. And what does he (husband) need to do to help him (brother) understand it.Of course in front of my brother I do not say anything and I stand by my husband. But behind closed doors I expressed how angry this had made me and how childish I thought he was being. I told him I understood if my brother was playing at the park there all night, but this is a situation where he was coming here to drop us off some food and was leaving and he didn’t need to be so rude. Let alone have such a ridiculous rule to never ever park in his spot even if it’s just for two minutes. My husband took this as mean not being on his side. And threw it in my face that he pays to live here and my brother lives here for free so he should be able to enforce this.So am I the asshole for not being able to understand where my husband is coming from.",

Also I have no idea how the system regarding preschool works in the US, so sorry if it is hard to understand.I gave birth to my son this August. In my country you get about 1,5 years worth of days you can take out to be on parental leave, most people save some of these days so they can stay home occasionally with their child as they get older. I am planning on taking all of these days and stay home until my son is at least 4. Of course a lot of planning has gone into this, I know we can’t eat the most extravagant food, buy the newest clothes or take expensive trips. But to me, staying home and taking care of my son is worth it. Even though I am planning on having him home for this long, I know how important it is for a child’s development to be around other kids and people in general. So every Saturday I take him to an open preschool, don’t know if it exists in the US but basically, everyone is welcome there with their child for a few hours, they play, we eat and do stuff together. There is a mother there who had her daughter last April. She expressed to me and some other parents how sad and upset she was about having to go back to work so soon and that she was stressed about leaving her daughter at preschool. She said that she wishes that she could be able to stay home as long as I planned, I said that it was possible. She told me that for them it wasn’t. I called bullshit on that, she obviously gets her hair colored, has makeup, trendy clothes and stuff like that. I told her that if she just budgeted and not spend that much on herself, of course she could stay home. She once again said that even if she did, they could not afford to stay home any longer. I know she has a husband, so it has nothing to do with that. I scoffed and said that “life is what you makes it out to be”. She seemed extremely upset over this. Later one of the people who organizes this asked to talk to me, she explained that they value kindness and respect here, and that if I continue to make this a hostile place then I would get another warning before being banned.Was I really an ass for just telling her the truth even though it may have been a little hard?

Our parents got divorced and we used to live with our mom who was an addict. She was abusive and neglectful. Through all that, my sister was my biggest rock. She protected me, took care of me, cooked and basically raised me till I was 13. Afterwards we started living with dad and things got so better.She passed away 2 months ago, ovarian cancer. We were prepared for it but it was still obviously very hard. After her funeral, I told my girlfriend (she was staying w me for a week, her house had some work being done) that I'm gonna be spending time with my family (they lived close) that week. She was kinda salty about that but it was sorted soon.  I'm doing better now. Sis loved roses, her name was Rosie too so as a memory and to pay respect to her, I've decided to get a tatoo of rose. Nothing big, just about 2 inches on my upper arm. My dad decided the same.I was telling my gf about it and she got very angry and started screaming about how disrespectful it is to tattoo another girl on me. I told her it's my sister we're  talking about and my dad's getting one  too. She says that's different. She started screaming, so I walked away. She has now gotten her friend involved who says the only way I'm getting that tattoo is if I also tattoo my gf's name on me and she agrees.I think that's stupid af. We've been together for a year and she expects me to TATTOO her on me?? She then proceeds to say how I must love her sister more than her and I told her that's not a fair comparison and it's a different love. She ain't ready to listen. Idk why is she so bothered by her. When my sister was alive, she lived close by too and I used to visit her like twice a month. I understand some siblings might not be that close but we've always been.

I used to have abs, but I haven't really cared as much about working out anymore, since I just feel comfortable in our relationship, and I know she doesn't care what my body looks like.We recently went out on a double date with some friends that I haven't seen in a while, Jack and Erica (fake names). We're all having a good time at dinner, joking around. Jack and I have known each other for a long time, and always tease each other, so he makes fun of me and says that it looks like I've gotten a bit chubby since we last saw each other. I laugh it off since that's how we've always been, and since it's not really true, I just have a slight gut now. His girlfriend Erica joins in and says that Jack has been working on his beer belly too, which Jack definitely has put on a few pounds recently like me. Jack says that we've both put on some happy relationship weight gain and grown guts. I say that I got the Boyfriend 20, joking that I've gained 20 pounds while dating my girlfriend. The conversation changed from there, but we were all laughing about it.Once we get home, my girlfriend says that I embarrassed her in front of my friends by saying that I said she made me fat. I get upset because she just inadvertently called me fat when I never said that at all, just that I had gained weight. I told her that I was just joking and that she shouldn't have taken it so seriously, especially because Erica was making the same type of jokes about Jack. I was also frustrated because she was making me feel bad about my weight gain, which I had never really cared about before. I told her that I know I'm responsible for myself getting a little chubby, but I didn't really care because I felt less pressure to look perfect while dating her. I guess this was the wrong thing to say because she got more upset.Am I the asshole?Edit: I weighed myself after making this post, and I'm actually 178 lbs right now, so a little heavier than I originally thought. I also have made jokes in the past about getting chunkier, but I've never used the word \"fat\" to describe myself, since I don't think it's true.A few of you were asking in the comments about my girlfriend's weight, and she's very healthy and has always been.

Long story short we adopted her and raised her as her mother and father.Husband and I procrastinated on this but we never gave her the talk. So we decided to just rip the band aid off. She was asking about why people get amicably divorced (not in those words) and I just said “well to be honest with you, I don’t know. I’ve only ever been with your dad, and obviously we never broke up.”And then kids got in the conversation and she asked the “why are you guys so much younger than all the other moms and dads?”And I just said “we’ll talk about that later” and we did. Husband and I talked to her in her room and just explained to her why the other parents are older and where she came from. She had an idea, but never got the full story. She didn’t cry at first. She just had questions, and then said “wait, Mommy, so that means we aren’t related at all?” And I didn’t know what to say and she broke down.Hardest moment of my life.And I just told her the truth. I said just because she came from somewhere different it doesn’t mean we love her any less than her siblings, and she’ll always be my first born.She was still very upset to find we aren’t related by blood. She said at least Dad and her are related somehow. She said she feels like she doesn’t belong here and she doesn’t fit in with her siblings.So today I told her there was something I’d like to give her. I showed her my grandmothers necklace. My grandmother gave it to her first born daughter (my mom) and I was going to wait until she was 13, but I think it’s time I give it to my first born daughter.My mother wasn’t upset I gave it to her, she was upset I gave it to her early. Her mother gave it to her when she was 13 and she gave it to me when I was 13.

I didn't cared about it at first, I was more intrigued than annoyed because this is the same G that is pretty close with other two queer work mates, H and J (at least from what I see in the office).I read the comments, and there were a bunch more peopl agreeing, disagreeing, etc.. and G was leaving comments(word for word), \"Cope. F@gs are not special\", \"Stop forcing it down everybodys throat\", \"Mental illness like this shouldn't be supported or normalised\", \"They're not going to heaven lol\", and more.I took screenshots and sent it to our two queer work mates and asked their thoughts about it. \"J\" replied saying he was disappointed because \"G\" seemed like a cool guy. And \"H\" didn't reply to me but reacted a thumbs up to my chat. Both unfollowed \"G\".I went to work the next morning and G was basically giving me the death stare. I didn't really notice him at first cuz Im just there to do my job and leave. But I noticed no one seemed to be talking to him like the usual.During break, I learned H and J told everyone else about his comment and how he made them feel unsafe. My name was also mentioned; they thanked me for the heads up about G.G didn't talk much and seemed grumpy throughout the whole day. He was the first one to leave as soon as our shift was over.I recieved a message from him how I was an asshole for sharing his comments with others. (His comments were buried deep in the post's comment section and a casual glance won't find it.). A few other guys told me what I did wasn't cool and he's free to share his opinion and that I didn't have to be obsessed with his comments and share them with H and J.I heard HR is currently dealing with it but I dont know what theyre exactly doing.",

She then shared via text that the total was $2200. I texted back saying that $250/person would not be bad at all. She then replied and said that only adults would be the ones paying, meaning that we would be paying almost $450/person.She then shared that she could not pay $250/person because that would mean she would be paying $1,000 for her, both of her daughters, and her daughters friend.I texted back saying that if we split it like that, I’ll just have to sit this trip out and left it at that.I cannot afford to pay for other’s kids/guests.

	"body" : "I (37f), have two siblings; little sister  Jane (35f) and little brother Josh (31m). BTW all names are fake.  I have three children, two boys and we just had a baby girl at the end of December.  My sister has a daughter and son, and my brother has two girls. Now when it comes to gift giving in our family, we only do it for the children twice a year, birthdays and Christmas. And nothing too expensive either.However, the last few years, my brother and his family have stopped giving gifts to my kids and my sisters kids.  With that being said, my sister and I have continued to give gifts to my brother’s two girls.  Now, if they were short on money or going through a rough time, we would completely understand.  However, my brother and his family either say they forgot and will get something in the future (which they never do) or make the excuse that they didn’t know they were supposed to get a gift.   We’ve even told them that even just a card from the dollar store would mean a lot, however that seems to fall on deaf ears.Also, my brothers two girls never appreciate any of the gifts they get.  Not to mention, the attitude of my brother and his wife doesn’t help the situation either.  Here is what I mean.  If you were to give the two girls a gift, then either it gets completely destroyed, lost or my brother and his wife will throw it away when it’s in perfect good condition.  A gift card or cash?  Gets lost and they don’t care where it is.  Clothes?  My brothers wife refuses to do laundry, the clothes get damaged and then they just throw it away when the girls have maybe worn it once or twice.  Books?  Get ripped and destroyed. Even second hand and homemade gifts are just tossed aside with my brother’s family. I cross-stitch for a hobby and can do lots of different projects.  Christmas stockings, wedding dates, welcome baby ones, the list goes on.  Well they really wanted baby date ones for their two girls and so I obliged and made that for them.   But where are they now?  Sitting in a closet, collecting dust and getting damaged when they keep piling stuff on top of it; which hurts me personally since I put so much work into them. The other members of my family don’t know what to do.  My parents don’t want to stir the pot, cause they know my brothers wife is very touchy and she is the gate keeper to their son. Tick her off and my brother will not speak to you until there’s been an apology to his wife; even if you are in the right and she is wrong.I personally feel like I am just done with it all.  I will still buy gifts for my sisters children and mine, but for my other two nieces?  Nope. My mom feels that this would be a complete a-hole move on my part and that my nieces will feel left out .Am I the a-hole?",

	"body" : "To preface: Me (31F) and my husband (33M) had our daughter Mary (16F) at a very young age. She was an accident and it was very hard at first, but we managed to raise a wonderful young lady.In middle school, Mary had a best friend Dan (16M). They were really close and since we’re neighbors, we encouraged them to hang out together.However as they started high school, Dan started running with the wrong crowd. He befriended a kid who would sneak out, drink, engage in destructive activities. Together they started bullying Mary. Since then I have some sort of a slow beef with Dan’s mom (44F). We are on speaking terms, but things are somewhat rough between us. I personally consider her parenting style a little too lax, she thinks I'm being too strict.It escalated when this kid pissed in Mary’s car’s gas tank. To say I was fuming was an understatement. I turned into a full-blown momzilla. I was ready to sue his whole family, luckily it didn’t happen since his mom was cooperative and compensated for the damage. I also told Dan’s mom that her kid’s friend destroyed my daughter’s property. No reaction.Obviously, things escalated further. Dan and his friend committed a felony. To be honest, it was expected of his friend, but the fact that Dan was an accomplice shocked me deeply. He’s a gentle and kind guy and it was horrible that he fell under bad influence. Dan’s mom was shocked as well, but to be honest it was something that she could expect after finding out that her kid got under bad influence, doing nothing about it, buying him substances so he could share with his friends. We live in CO btw, but still weed isn't something I'd introduce my child to.That was what I openly told her after she complained about “how come my precious baby commit a felony” and “how did you manage to make Mary avoid the sketchy stuff”. I told her that if she was slightly stricter with her parenting, she’d avoid Dan having legal troubles now. She told me that I’m being hypocritical since I did quite an amount of stupid stuff in my youth too. I did, and I’m not proud of it. But I’ve never touched substances and I’ve never committed a felony. I took the responsibility and accepted the consequences and managed to raise a decent human being who won’t repeat my mistakes.I’m an insightful person and I’ve been thinking now whether it was worth it to drag the conflict for all this time and escalating it into an open confrontation.",

My partner’s sibling is engaged and they have decided to do a destination wedding in the fiancé’s home country.This is because the fiancés family is larger, and solely resides in their home country and cannot travel to our home country. The engaged couple intend to marry in the fiancés home country and then return to our home country.This will require myself, my partner and my partner’s parents to fly in order to attend.The issue that has arisen is they have  proposed a wedding date in the immediate future that significantly conflicts with our respective lives. To explain:Both my partner and I have jobs that wouldn’t allow us to book time off specifically around the date they’ve proposed. We would need to catch red-eye flights and arrive on the day of with little to no sleep involved. This is a non-negotiable conflict, neither of us can take a few days off beforehand given our professions.My partner’s parents have a pre-existing scheduling conflict that would allow them to attend. However, they would essentially arrive a few days before, attend, and then leave.The engaged couple do have an urgency to their wedding and I can understand that. However, I do not understand why they cannot get court room married and then plan a destination ceremony allowing everyone to attend comfortably without the stress. To me, given the urgency, these events can be separate and do not have to be done simultaneously.I feel like we are being forced into a rock and a hard place - we want to attend, but will not be able to present our best selves. My partner is willing to endure because it’s their sibling, but, I am of the opinion we will likely be so stressed out and burnt out that we will fight and not have a good time whatsoever.Naturally I do not have any info from my partner’s fiancés side on why they’ve chosen the proposed date. So perhaps there is a more significant driving force on their end.So WITBA if I put my foot down and say “I’m sorry, but your proposed wedding date does not work with my schedule”.",

	"title" : "AITA for telling my friend I don't care that her dogs died?",
	"body" : "The title is as bad as I feel I know but I think I really messed up. I'm a 31 yr old female and my friend A is 33 we have known each other for 23yrs and I love her very much. But  I would say we have drifted apart and now she only messages me when she wants something. The last year has been really hard on me. My grandfather died of cancer, my best friend of twenty years ended our friendship abruptly and I have had multiple seizures sometimes back to back to back. Earlier this year her dogs [multiple] died suddenly and when it happened in August I was there for her.I sent her a sympathy card, stayed up late with her on skype just listening to her vent and even got her an ornament of her dogs to give her some comfort. I did this several times and even would randomly call her just to remind her that I love her and that I am here for her. I listened every time she recited the horrible story of how her dogs died; no matter how upset it made me. I now know where she was, when and how it happened and could easily recite it by heart. I understand she was traumatized which is why I feel awful.But  here's the thing, A has never been the best pet owner, she never fixes her pets or takes them to the vet but has money for things like plushies and comic books, and her dog had been sick for months. I begged her to take the dog to the vet but she sighted she can't afford it. And then back in November around thanksgiving I got a skype call from my grandfather. He was 90 years old and dying of cancer and although I only got 10 yrs with him [he lived in a third-world country] I was so close to him. I had the worst thanksgiving ever and when he said goodbye he even asked me to tell him it was ok to go.Last week, A called me and wished me a happy new year; she was late but whatever. She asked me how I was and I told her that I will be ok but it's my first year without him in the last decade. She asked me if I was okay and I said \"not really,\"  and that I am struggling. Here's where I might be the asshole, she said, \"Yeah I know how you feel my dog left a hole too.\" and proceeded to recount the way her dogs died *yet again.*I told her, \"Yes I know but can we not talk about this again? I really need to vent and it's not the same as losing a pet.\" I know she misses them but I am grieving and really just needed someone to listen to me; I know she isn't my therapist but come on.And she told me that the pain of losing my grandfather was *equal* to the pain of losing my grandfather because she was just as traumatized as I am. I lost it, I just lost it.  I snapped at her, \"I don't CARE that your dog's died! I get it! THEY DIED! Can we focus on me for Once?! My grandfather is dead!\" and I broke down crying while she called me an asshole and hung up leading to a barrage of texts calling me a heartless asshole.  Was I though?

	"body" : "My husband and I are going to an indoor waterpark resort for a few days. We're taking his bio Avery 14 my bio Robin 9 and ours Alex 2. This will be the first time since covid that we've been able to do something like this with the kids.Avery wants to invite a friend to go with us for the weekend. I'm not a fan of this and told my husband that. When Avery does invite a friend over, they and the friend stay locked in the bedroom, gaming, talking, refusing to come out to talk or eat with everyone else and it feels like other than the noise they make, they might as well not even be here. We're lucky if Avery speaks more than 10 words to us the whole weekend when they bring a friend over.That said, I told my husband I'm really worried about that being what happens if Avery brings a friend on the trip. Avery will spend all the time with their friend and none with us, and with this being our first time away since covid I really want it to be family time. My husband said that he'd set rules that Avery and friend would get some time during the day to do their own thing, but the rest of the time would be doing things all together. It's not even the case at home, so why would that be the case now, but if he's positive he can make that happen, go ahead.My husband called Avery (we were both talking to her) and told them the rules and expectations. Avery said sure no problem, then said the friend they originally invited couldn't go, so they invited a new friend they recently made. (That's not a big deal and it happens.) I asked Avery this new friend's name (Avery said Jade, and for the parent's phone number. Avery started saying it's fine, Jade's parent's don't mind if they go with us, and besides they don't even know Jade's parents numbers, but they promise it's fine. At that point my husband told Avery to call or text Jade, get their parents number and get it to him by the end of the day.We've never met Jade or their parents, and I wasn't sure if it was a good idea to bring a kid we hadn't met trip and I said as much. Anyway, 11pm rolls around and Avery texts their dad that they didn't get Jade's parents number but it's still OK because it's fine for Jade to go and their parents don't mind.I said to my husband that I don't agree with taking another child several hours away without at least talking to the parents and making sure they dont mind and know where we will be and how to contact us directly. My husband agrees and told Avery that and since they didn't get us a way to contact Jade's parents they are no longer allowed to bring a friend on the trip. Avery is upset and blames me for ruining the trip for them and told us they're going to have the worst weekend of their life. My husband feels bad for how Avery feels but says he does agree with me. And I just feel bad about it all around. AITA??sorry if it's hard to read. tried to keep things as gender neutral as possible for privacy reasons and I'm on mobile.edit: looks like things blew up. Avery told their mom that Jade was going with us to the waterpark and it was all good with Jade's parents. Bio mom called my husband to confirm and we said no, that we didn't have a way to contact Jade's parents and talk to them so we'd said that Avery could not bring Jade. Bio mom didn't have Jade's parents contact info either, but she had their email addresses because the 2 kids have classes together. Bio mom emailed Jade's parents asking for their number and giving them her number and my husband's. Jade's parents called bio mom to thank her for taking Jade for the weekend because they had a family issue to attend to. Bio mom told them that Jade isn't staying at her house, Avery had invited Jade to waterpark several hours away with my husband and me. Jade's parents called my husband to ask what the hell is going on. We ended up telling them Avery had invited Jade but had not provided us with any contact info so we ended up telling Avery no to bringing Jade along. Jade's parents were so confused, they thought Jade was staying with Avery at bio mom's house, but then bio mom had no idea that Jade was supposedly staying there and the parents had absolutely no idea about the waterpark thing at all. Now Jade is grounded by their parents and has to go with them to deal with a family situation. And bio mom and my husband grounded Avery for lying and they're no longer allowed to go to the waterpark either.",

Flash forward to a bridesmaid dress appointment with just his sister, she told me that they were planning on having another baby soon. I was so excited for her but then I asked when they were planning on trying. She told me that they were going to shoot for november (9 months from my wedding). I had asked if they do what was there plan if they are due relatively around our wedding. She replied with well I went into labor early last time so it will be fine.  I had brought it up to my fiance because to me that was not only a weird place to bring it up but also weird to plan to try 9 months from your brothers wedding. Side note his sister got married about 4 years ago on his birthday. So when I brought it up all he said to me was I just want 1 day. We had a really long talk on the what ifs. We went and talked to then about how we would really love to have both of them in the wedding and how we arnt telling them not to have children but if you could not be due around our wedding so we don't have to ask one to step out.

We're civil with each other but don't really have much in common. She's always been vocal about how she doesn't believe in god and ghosts and other supernatural stuff like that and I actually share her views.Now this is where the problem arose. While we were having lunch the topic of deceased relatives was brought up. I told them about an uncle of mine who died during the pandemic in 2021 due to covid. I was really close to my uncle so much so that I considered him my second dad. He was always supportive of me and always bought me everything I ever asked for. I'd call and talk to him almost everyday. So when I lost him, I honestly feel like I lost a piece of myself. I told them that once we were done with the funeral rites for him, my family and I were sitting around when the light in the room went off all of a sudden and I felt something on my head almost like a light touch from someone's hand. It was probably just the wind but I truly did think that was a sort of final farewell from my uncle.When I finished, my friends thought it was rather sweet....except for Kim. I didn't even ask her but she said that it was most definitely not my uncle cause no ghost was that sentimental and to grow up. She said it was \"cringe\" and to not make up \"bs sentimental nonsense\". I was honestly just speechless. I just said \"You're such a fucking bitch get tf away from me you pos\" and this just seemed to make her tick. All i remember was her saying something along the lines of how i should be grateful that my uncle wasn't here to see what a pos I was. I think about there must be some underlying hatred because of that outburst but i genuinely have never said or done anything to hurt her.Most of my friends are on my side except one who said that what I said hurt her really bad and now she's crying and upset all the time because I insulted her in front of everyone.

However, a week ago, we were at an event and my gf saw a reminder of my phone for the upcoming concert and she said that she had a performance showcase coming up (she does the performing arts) and turns out that it is taking place on the exact same Wednesday night next week. i was made aware of the showcase in question at the beginning of this year, however the specific date was never really mentioned until the notif. my concert goes from 8pm-12am and her showcase has 2 events with the times ranging from 8-9pm and 9-10pmi asked yesterday what was going on next wednesday for clarification. she asked if i would be able to ditch my concert to attend her showcase which i outright refused since i thought it was unfair for me to flake on an event which i had booked prior to finding out about her showcase.  then she asked if i would be able to at least come late to the concert to attend the 8-9pm event  so i can at least see her performing on stage, which i refused. she got upset about it and compared it to an infant child in school performing and being sad because they can't see their parents in the crowd and how i was the mean parent not being there for their child. at the event im going to partake in recreational drugs which is preventing me from driving; IF i had my car it would be alot easier to drive to the venue after her showcase which wouldve made it viablenow she is claiming that i am ditching her to do drugs and that if i really supported her i would at least try to compromise by coming to this concert a few hours later.  to be clear; i understand just how important performing arts is to my girlfriend and i am extremely supportive of all of her endeavours and love her very dearly HOWEVER I have been looking forward to this concert for a very long time and transportation arrangements have already been made; everything would be knocked out of wack and i would be very stressed attempting to get to the venue in time. so now i feel like im at an ultimatum; choose my gf or this concertmy girlfriend is extremely upset and i feel terrible because i wont be able to support her on her big night. she insists that this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience and that my concert would always be available next year and the year after that etc. i think that we are both at fault for communication issues; i should've asked for the date of her showcase much earlier and she should've told me much earlier to keep the day freei feel terrible for not being able to support my girlfriend on her special day but at the same time its not my fault that she made me aware of this showcase until recentlyAITA for not compromising my concert plans to attend my girlfriend's showcase?",

	"title" : "AITA for telling my best friend not to undress in front of the camera while we video chat?",
	"body" : "Me and my best friend have regular video calls because we live in different states.We mostly have a call when my boyfriend is not around (I live with him), sometimes he is at home tho.When we video call, she sometimes undress herself, like changing clothes or when she feels too hot. She is not completely naked, but in underwear like panties or bra or sports bra.After the third time I told her not to do that because sometimes my boyfriend could walk past by.She said why? He is not there anyways. And I told her he is. She then said, its not a big problem, he would see her like this on the beach as well. I told her well its not the same and told her not to do that anymore.She used to do that too when I was living alone, which was fine for me, but now I am living with my boyfriend its something else.Also I told her she should always assume he is there even though he most of the time isnt, but I am not going to make an announcement everytime we talk, if he is there or not. Its not hard to turn the camera while dressing, what most people doShe said I am overreacting. I think I am not. I am requesting something really normal and she shouldnt do that regardless.AITA?Forgot to add: She asked me if I was jealous if my boyfriend would see her like this and undressing. I said no, its just normal not to do that.Edit: I read some of the comments by now and I find it super interesting to hear different opinions.First of all, yes I could have just turn off the camera by myself or switched to phone call. She undresses herself randomly without any warning and sometimes I just do stuff on the side, where there is no chance I can turn the screen immediately down or so.About the jealousy thing. That is not my point at all. When I lived by myself of course I wouldnt have a problem with her randomly undressing since there is only both of us and we are comfortable with each other. Now I am living with someone else, which is my partner, I also have to consider about him and it doesnt matter if its my boyfriend, my parents, my siblings or even another girl friend of mine. Not everyone wants to see someone undress and half naked. If I put this situation on me, I would never change my clothes in front of the camera, when I am not sure or clearly know that my friends boyfriend (or anyone else, her friend, parents etc.) are around and there could be a chance that they get a glimpse of me. For me that is not a normal thing to do. I just thought that also occurred to her when I moved out, that now we are not only two people here.About the that she is in her home, she can do whatever she wants. Yes, she can. But she doesnt need to do it in the video call. If shes at home naked all day I dont care, but if she lives on ground floor and has the window wide open, where everybody can see her naked. That is an issue.Last thing about the bikini. For me its not the same. Just because my colleagues and boss saw me in bikini before for whatever reason, doesnt mean that I need to show up like this to work. I guess that is just personal opinions.In the future I would consider phone calls over video calls, even tho we do prefer video calls.Thanks for all the imput.",

	"title" : "AITA for saying my friend was overreacting about feeling unsafe?",
	"body" : "I (15F) have a scholarship to a private school that would otherwise charge a total of £120K. I have a group of 6 close friends (all 14/15 year old girls) who all range from regular middle class to very wealthy. We occasionally have sleepovers at each other's houses, and I'm the only one who's yet to host one. Here's the thing: I live in a council house (basically a house we don't have to pay for) in a very lower class neighbourhood full of crime, burglaries, robberies, fights, etc. My friends know that I'm poor but they'd never treated me differently for it until now.We planned to stay at my place for the weekend, and we went straight to my home after school. On the way, one of my friends kept making remarks about how \"intimidating\" the people were in my area and the others just agreed, including calling this homeless man who came up to us asking for money \"creepy\" and \"perverted\". This group of teenagers started randomly harassing and yelling stuff at us, trying to start an argument, and when they left my friends called them \"trashy\" and \"chavs\" (a derogatory term for lower class people). Previously I'd opened up to them about how hard it was to live here and how our house had been vandalised before and how we had to hide valuables incase of a break-in. I live in a small two bedroom flat on the first floor. My bedroom is only a box room that's small enough for my bed to fit exactly at one end, I sleep on a mattress on the floor, and the only other furniture I had was a box for storage and when my friends saw this they kept giving fake, sarcastic compliments about how \"cozy\" and \"tiny\" it was.After about an hour, one of my friends called her parents to pick her up and made some excuse about how she suddenly remembered that she had a family thing planned, which I initially believed. Then, soon after, another friend also said she had to leave as she was feeling sick. At this point I got suspicious and they eventually revealed that they felt \"unsafe\" staying over in my neighbourhood and wanted to leave. One friend said my house felt dangerous since my mum was working a shift that afternoon and wouldn't come home until midnight, and my friend was scared someone might break in, which was so irrational because I'd lived here my whole life and I was fine. She was the richest of us and lived in a huge house and had no idea what it's like to not be privileged. She had an awful experience in a poor neighbourhood a few years ago so I get what she was feeling, but we were literally staying inside so there's no reason for her to overreact.I told her she was being overdramatic, yet the rest and my friends all agreed with her saying she was justified in feeling unsafe. I couldn't stand how they made me feel alienated for being poor and how they couldn't even walk in my shoes for one weekend. In the heat of the moment I said my friends were all spoiled brats, and we ended up in a huge argument and they ended up cancelling the sleepover. AITA?",

	"body" : "My friend got \"married\". I put the word marriage in quotes because I found out after the fact that there was actually no legal marriage that happened, as his girlfriend apparently didn't believe in legal marriage. They instead had a ?symbolic? marriage to celebrate their commitment to eachother after being together for almost 4 years, but the guests were led to believe that it was a legal marriage. He and his now ex-girlfriend had asked for donations for their honeymoon in lieu of wedding gifts. The 'wedding' happened, and then his girlfriend broke up with him before they even went on their honeymoon. Weeks have now passed, and they never returned any of the guests' donations for their honeymoon fund.  I don't want to rub salt in the wound, and I understand that once a gift is given, it is done; however, this is an unusual circumstance. Am I being an asshole  asking for the money gift back?Edit: Some answers to commenter questions: I donated 200$ as my wedding gift for their honeymoon fund. Yes, there was a wedding party and food was offered (nothing super fancy); though from what I was told, the wedding was paid for by their parents. Many guests, including myself, paid a lot of additional expenses to travel to their wedding to attend (hotel costs, time off of work, gas).",

I said absolutely not and that It was just an accident.I wouldn't allow my daughter near the dog for the time being so as to avoid that happening again. Hank has not dropped It and he actually did call animal control which went no where. Also my daughter and dog have a good relationship.

	"body" : "My wife and I share two sons, Dave (13M) and Ryan (12M), and she has a son from a previous marriage, Gordon (15M). I've been involved in Gordon's life since he was around 1 1/2 years old due to the fact that his father passed away 6months after he was born. Although I've basically been in Gordons life since he can remember,  he still doesn't view me as a father and I respect that.Recently, for Ryan's birthday, he was really adamant about celebrating his birthday at Dave and Busters. However, Gordon didn't want to attend. This upset Ryan as he wanted his brother present for the celebration. Despite our efforts to persuade Gordon, he insisted on not attending, claiming he didn't want to go to Dave and Busters. In attempt to avoid any conflict with Gordon, I allowed him to stay home, with the condition that he remain in the house and answer our calls when we check on him. He agreed.Ryan really enjoyed his time at Dave and Busters and was eager about turning 13 next year. We checked in on Gordon three times while we were away. Once while we were driving to Dave and busters, second while we arrived at Dave and Busters, and third when we were driving home.When we arrived home we discovered Gordon was not at home. We called and texted him multiple times and he didn't reply nor answer. My wife contemplated on caling the police because this isn't the first time he has done this but I suggested we go search first before we call. After a while, we located him at a friend's house.  My wife and I were relieved. He reluctantly came back home with us.I expressed my disappointment and told him that If he wanted to go to his friends house he shouldve called or texted us and we would've been fine as long as we knew where he was. I told him that he's shown us countless times that he cannot be trusted. We decided, due to his actions, to temporarily restrict his access to phone and PS5 until trust is rebuilt.This pissed him off and he said that I'm not his fucking father so I don't get to tell him what to do. I told him that I legally adopted him and told that whether he likes it or not he's living under my roof and will abide by my rules. My wife backed me up and told me supported my decision which only pissed him off even more. He eventually handed over his phone and his PS5 and I put them in my room. I told him that he'll get them back If he shows a change in his behavior.This led me wondering because my step son is barely talking to me and his mom at the moment and I feel like if we give him his things back he'll think that he can get away with anything. In November of last year he snuck out of the house while we were sleeping and once we woke up we realized he was missing and we had to call the cops because we didn't know where he was. Once he was found we only grounded him for 3 days. I feel like we keep enabling his behavior just to please him but I'm wondering If I was too harsh?ETA: Added new information due to the character count",

	"body" : "My (33M) girlfriend (28F) have been together for almost 4 years, but only began living together just over a year ago. Before that we were long distance and I used to send her flowers for special occasions and sometimes just because. I often spent a good deal of money on a dozen roses. She was very grateful and would say how when she looked at them it reminded her of me and made her smile. It might be worth noting she never brought me flowers, but that didn't bother me as its a bit of a girly thing (no judgement or whatever, but honestly I could care less about flowers).Anyway, now to the issue at hand. Since living together I haven't brought her flowers - honestly I hadn't really thought to, because I'm right here in the same flat and so she doesn't need a reminder of me. Well just before Christmas she brought a Christmas flower arrangement, which I figured was just part of decorating for christmas. Early January she threw it out, and in its place appeared another vase of flowers, which I didn't say anything about because she was not working (she's a private school teacher and was off for their Christmas holidays) and I figured she's just bored. But I guess they died and now there's another vase of flowers in its place, and this time it's a dozen roses!I asked her what was up with the roses, and she said she likes flowers and that as I never buy her them anymore she has decided to get them for herself. I didn't say anything at the time but this has really got to me questioning her. It seems really passive aggressive to go out and buy roses for yourself just to make a point (literally identical to the arrangements I brought for her!). And now every time I walk into the kitchen I am hit with how shitty a boyfriend she thinks I am.Edit: I appreciate the comments, even though some of them were hard to swallow.It seems the jury is split, I’m either an unloving asshole because I've overlooked an obvious hint to gift my girlfriend flowers and make her happy, or I’m a self-absorbed asshole and her purchasing flowers isn't anything to do with me.

A few of the boys in her class are friends with the boy, they were playing basketball at recess when he asked to speak to his friends.He told them my daughter and her friends were bullying this boy because he is transgender. The other boys immediately went to the teacher to tell her, even though he asked them not to because he was scared of the social consequences.When my husband and I found out about this, we were furious. It’s also personal for my husband, he’s a teacher and a baseball coach and he has a student who’s an 8th grader and is a trans boy, the boys on his team are friends with this boy and while he doesn’t play with them, he helps out with a lot of the behind the scenes stuff (like equipment, acting as a scorekeeper at games). He knows how much both his players and the trans student admire him.We told our daughter she was grounded until further notice, she lost all electronics, she can’t see her friends outside of school, ect.

I yelled at her for disrespecting my parenting. We got into an argument and it left in my family leaving early.Later on last night, my sister called me to work things out, she demanded I apologize, but I refused to do so because I think she’s the one in the wrong, but she keeps telling me she won’t speak to me until I apologize.AITA?",

Last time I F(22) saw him M(10), he was just over 4, and this was his first visit in all these years. We only managed to spend a handful of times together over the break, and he's set to leave in a week.I'm anticipating one last meet-up in a few days, and my stepmom (SMom) gave me a talk about not crying when I see him. Her concern stemmed from a previous instance where I cried as I said goodbye to him and his family, thinking it was our final day together before they headed back. On that occasion, he cried too, as we had anticipated and discussed the night before. We both acknowledged our sadness and the fact that we'd miss each other dearly. That day though, I wasn’t sobbing, just visibly tearful and upset. In fact, I was even the one comforting and reassuring my cousin that everything would be okay and I’m only a message away. He also had a choice to stay another day, but I told him his other cousins who lived a few cities away might miss him too.During the talk, my SMom reminded me, \"You saw that he was upset, so you have to control yourself.\" To which I responded, \"I promise, I really tried to hold it back as much as possible, and that’s something I thought of too.\" Knowing he's younger, I understood the expectation for me to be \"stronger.\" Despite my assurance, my SMom reiterated not to cry, asking, \"Don’t you feel bad for him?\" I repeated what I said again, but with a bit of a tone which I feel bad about. After that, everything was a bit of a blur as I just kept nodding and I tried to make my mind wander off so as to not speak anymore ill. The conversation ended and there’s a bit of tension now, but I wouldn’t know how bad till the morning.My SMom has always been better at holding her tears back. I, on the other hand, am admittedly more emotional. However, I was taken aback as it seemed as if I hadn't considered my cousin's feelings if I cried and hadn't attempted to be strong. It's worth noting that the uncertainty of their next visit added to my emotions. He's like a brother, and his mom was almost like a second mother during my upbringing, so all the distance is hard.

Anyway my sister (28f) had a baby and is always telling me how hard it is to manage as a sahm while her husband is working and how amazing it would be if someone could watch her baby so both of them could have a job (she doesn't want to apply her to kindergarden or pay a babysitter cuz it's expensive) i tried to change conversation cuz i knew that she wanted me to babysit my niece, but then she straight up asked me if i would be willing to be her nanny till she's at least 2-3 so that they wouldn't have to pay a stranger to babysit her. I told her that it wouldn't be possible cuz 1 i'm applying to college next year and 2 i have a job so i wouldn't have time for it, she told me that i could just quit cuz \"it's not even a real job\". While i do agree with her that my part time job isn't something special, i'm still getting some pocket money out of it, i then told her that i'll quit and babysit my niece till next year when i'll have to apply, but only if she pays me 30.000rsd monthly, win-win situation right? I mean babysitters are usaully paid $5/hour here where i live so that sounded like a great deal to me but looks like it's not, she got mad that i'll even request something like that and that it's selfish to demand money for babysitting my own flesh and blood (her words) I told her then that i'm not quitting my \"fake job\" to babysit my niece and that she'll have to figure it out. We're currently not speaking much and when we do she tries to change my mind about quiting my part time job, my family thinks that i'm in the wrong here and should help my sister out so i'm not sure what to do.

I love my niece but i'm not her guardian and i have priorities and my own life, for now i'll just focus on getting into my college of choice and making most of my teenage years. A part time job is more than enough, i don't want to be the parent that i never knew i would be pressured to be. Thank you all for reading and i'll post if there are any major updates but i think that there won't be :)",

	"title" : "AITA for my autistic sister running off in the store and getting lost?",
	"body" : "I (18m) live with my father, stepmother, and two youngest half-sisters. The oldest of the sisters is nonverbal autistic. We'll refer to her as Thing 1 and the younger sister as Thing 2. Thing 1 is 4 y/o, and Thing 2 is 2 y/o.Recently, we've been trying to train Thing 1's service dog, so he can be certified to accompany her into places when we have outings. Today, my stepmom, Thing 1, Thing 2, and I decided to head to the shops while Dad was at work. We stopped at the local supermarket to pick up some cat food and other necessities.We arrived, had a lovely shopping experience, and went to the tills to checkout. Thing 1 and her dog were in the basket of the trolley, and Thing 2 was sitting in the children's seat. My stepmom paid for her things, and then I began paying for my stuff. As I did so, I watched as Stepmom took Thing 1 and her dog put of the cart, as they both had become restless for waiting so long.Almost immediately after they were taken out, the dog made a mess in the floor, which Stepmom was happy to clean up with towels and spray given by the cashier. By this time, Thing 2 started in on a crying fit. I quickly finished the transaction, and grabbed the dog, made sure he didn't make any further messes, and placed him back in the trolley. I went to return Thing 1 to the basket as well, only to realize she was nowhere to be seen. We quickly split up to search for her.Five minutes, a missing child announcement, and a couple heart attacks later, we found her next to the cookie display. We called off the search the employees started, and we made our way out of the store. The rest of the outing went off without a hitch, and we all returned home safely.All was fine, and no words were had about the trip until my dad returned from work. My stepmom told him about the scare that Thing 1 gave us today, and he proceeded to lay into me about how irresponsible I am and how I should've been paying better attention.My stepmom isn't upset with me in the slightest, but what my father said made me really rethink the situation.

The thing is that I have a 3yo brother and my mom works a lot of hours so I look after him a lot. Like I'm basically raising him. His father isn't in the picture and my mom hasn't even mentioned this new baby's father so it would probably be the same. And I really really don't want to raise another sibling. I'm 16 years old and I basically feel like a teen mom, I don't have any time to myself except at school.So when my mom told me she's pregnant again I asked her if she could please not have the baby or give it up for adoption because I don't want to be raising 2 kids for her. She was really offended and said I'm just babysitting which is normal for older siblings. And she said I don't get to tell her whether to have a baby or not. I don't think I'm doing normal babysitting because I'm literally looking after him every moment I'm not in school. I take him to daycare, I pick him up from daycare, I look after him until he goes to bed. I just can't do this with 2 kids.",

	"title" : "AITA for replacing my model for gaining weight?",
	"body" : "I (16F) am a college student taking textiles as one of my subjects. For a project, we had to create a collection of designs that would be showcased in a school fashion show. Most of the other girls chose to model their own designs, but I initially felt too shy to do so. I chose four of my friends to model for my outfits, who were from UK sizes 6-10, and made my dresses to fit their measurements.One of my friends (17F) was a size 8 (which is a size 4 in the US btw), and her dress was meant to be the centrepiece of my project. In the four months since I first started working on the dress, my friend has managed to gain a lot of weight. She was taking medication for her bipolar disorder, and one of the side effects was weight gain, going up 8 dress sizes. The material I used for my dress was quite stretchy so I thought her size wouldn’t matter that much. However, we were doing a rehearsal of the fashion show a few weeks ago when her dress suddenly split down one of the seams. We were three weeks away from the showcase, so there was still enough time to fix it. That said, I was worried that the dress might break again and there wouldn’t be enough time to mend it, or even worse, it might break during the actual catwalk. I decided that I should wear the dress instead since I knew the choreography of the catwalk, so we wouldn’t have to waste time teaching anyone else. Plus, all the other designers were wearing their own dresses, and I was started to regret my decision to stay behind the scenes.I broke the news to my friend and she was extremely upset over my decision. She had been looking forward to this for months, and she had been feeling depressed over her weight gain and thought that modelling make her confident again. I told her that it wasn’t her fault she gained weight due to her meds but I just needed a good grade and it wasn’t anything personal. She pointed out that we had three weeks until the show, so I had plenty of time to adjust the dress to make it bigger. In order to tailor the dress I would have to remove most of the embellishments and reapply them again after adding a large panel to the bodice. I still had to study for exams in two other subjects, and I didn’t want to risk over stressing and having an incomplete dress by the deadline, so I refused to alter the dress. Ever since then she’s been acting passive aggressive towards me, always bringing up her mental health and body image issues around me, as if she’s trying to make me feel guilty for my decision.

	"title" : "AITA for not shoveling my neighbors driveway and refusing to help them get their car unstuck after they told me I should be nicer?",
	"body" : "I (27M) live in a duplex with my fiance'. The duplex has a single driveway that I share with my neighbors, but they both park their cars in the driveway even though both houses have a garage. I don't hate my neighbors, we both just do our own thing, but I've attempted before to try and be nice and neighborly to them. I've invited them to cookouts, offered help with yardwork, brought them their packages that were left at my door, etc. And nothing I do seems to be enough to get even a 'thank you' out of them.We've gotten a lot of snow during the cold snap that's affecting half of the U.S. right now. One day, after we had a big snowstorm, I got done shoveling my side of the driveway and I decided to be nice and shovel and salt their side, too. I again didn't get a thank you, even though I waved at them when I saw them getting home.Then, a day later, we had another big snowstorm. I didn't have time before I had to get to work, so I made plans to shovel when I got home. When I got home, the neighbor's side of the driveway was cleared while mine was a literal mound of powder and ice. I also noticed a snowblower left outside right in front of their garage. I admittedly got a little mad but didn't confront them about it. I'd use one too if I had it, but to leave my side a complete mound that I had to shovel by hand, most of it frozen from the negative weather, and I felt like I could almost hear them laughing at me.We had yet another snowstorm this morning, but today was my day off and so before my fiance' had to go to work herself, I shoveled/froze my ass off. I only did my side of the driveway. After an hour, I heard a knock at my door. It was the neighbors, both of them looking annoyed and cold. The guy asked if I could help them, as the furthest car down the driveway was stuck, so neither of them could leave (the other car was parked in front of that one). I thought about just laughing and shutting the door, but I just went out and got ready to shovel yet again.When I stepped out, the guy started berating me, asking why I didn't do their side of the driveway when I was out earlier. The woman, who was in the car, started yelling at me that it was my fault that he was going to be late for work because I could've cleared the snow behind them, but I chose not to. So I brought up the aforementioned snowblower, but the guy said it was 'out of the question' and stated he didn't have enough gas for it or the money to get it because of the high price. I asked if that was the case, I literally have a full gas tank in my garage he could use, but the guy said there was no time and I just had to 'be nicer'.So I got my shovel out of the garage, gave it to the guy, then went back inside. They were both yelling at me even after I went in, and later on, I found my shovel in the yard. They did get their car out eventually.AITA?",

	"body" : "My roommate and I both have our names on our lease that was renewed back in Oct 2023 which ends on Nov 2024. We made an agreement with each other that we would each be paying for half of the total monthly rent, and this agreement has been in place since before the lease renewal.At the end of December 2023 he told me he found a better opportunity and would be moving out in January.He told me that if we paid $[x] between the two of us, we could buy out of the lease completely and it would count for our rent payments for 2 months after that (we need a 2 months written notice to terminate the lease.) If that was the case, I told him I wouldn't mind paying for half of it because it would be cheaper for both of us in the long run - mutually beneficial.However, sensing this was total B.S. I spoke with my property manager who clarified that the $[x] is a separate charge and we are still rent responsible for the following 2 months after that notice is given (so March 31st if we gave our notice before the 31st of this month). That made more sense. I do not feel comfortable paying half of the termination fee out of my own pocket simply so he can move out while I stay here.When I expressed to him that I would not pay half of the $[x] just so he can leave, I was told by him that we will \"cross this bridge when we get there.\"He decided yesterday that he would \"help me\" with rent until the end of February. \"Help me...\" meaning that he shows no intention of paying his part of the rent after that point. Keep in mind: his name is still on the lease agreement. If he chooses to terminate the lease sometime in February if a roommate isn't found, our 2-month notice is pushed back to April 31st and we are both still rent responsible until then. That's 2 full months of rent that he has no intention of paying.I am unable to pay the entire rent on my own which means that he will have the face the consequences just as much as I would if he refuses to pay his half. This also means that even though he is searching for a roommate, I am in search of a roommate myself as well simply out of fear and obligation. I do not feel like I should be responsible for not finding a roommate if a roommate is not found. I also recognize that since I cannot pay the rent fully on my own, we will both be legally responsible when he decides to stop paying.So, I am kindly asking if AITA forA) Alerting him that I will not be accepting responsibility for paying the possible termination fee if it was his choice to leave in the first placeB) Letting him know that I will not be accepting responsibility for finding a roommate to fill the spot that he is leaving behind and letting him know that said responsibility is his own",

The company he was working for went under, I had to go from a SAHM to working overtime because he had an incredibly hard time finding anything else. We have 3 kids. (4M, 2M, and 1F.)We ended up having to move back to our home state, and back in with my parents for a few weeks until our new home was ready. In the few weeks that we stayed my mother splurged on our kids. She bought them clothes, children furniture (bunk bed, and playpen.) All in all, if I had to estimate how much she spent on our kids, I would probably guess she spent $1200. Then Christmas came, and she splurged even more on my kids toys (I would estimate $500 for all the toys she bought them.)My mom came to me a week ago saying she believes it's only fair she claims one of my children on her taxes as a dependent so she recieves the money for it and it would make us even. I was shocked. I'm not comfortable with anyone, not even my own mother, having my kid's information. I told her that as well and she got angry with me, pointing out all the things she had bought for my children and how it was the least we could do for \"traumatizing her with our children during our stay.\"I told my mother I wouldn't allow it, but she was more than welcome to total everything up and I would give her the money myself. She refused and insisted on claiming one of my children. The more I think about the whole situation the more I don't even want to pay her back.

His work requires moving every few years and I followed him wherever he needed to go during our marriage but he never seemed grateful and didn't acknowledge that I sacrificed a lot for his job. He was also very assertive about the things he wanted to do and not do with his time so I didn't prioritize the things I wanted because I felt like I shouldn't inconvenience him.Our last move was close to my home town and we bought a house in order to settle here long term, thinking his moving days were done. After our separation our plan was still to live near to each other in this area for the sake of the kids. He has now been unexpectedly asked to do a 2 year project in a far away town. His plan is to try fly back every second weekend to see the kids.Working around his work schedule, I agreed to go away with the kids for a weekend next month, with some close friends who are visiting from overseas and have kids of the same age. He now wants to change his schedule, and wants me to leave the kids with him and not take them away with me that weekend. The reason is because his dad turns 70 the weekend before, so he now wants to go visit his dad that weekend instead of the kids.  If he does this, that means they don't see each other for 3 weeks.My answer to him was that I'm not willing to change my plans. I spent so long fitting my life into the gaps between his career and his plans, and I don't want to do that anymore. It feels unfair to ask me to not take the kids on this weekend away because he wants to change his schedule. I am finally planning things for myself. I obviously don't want the kids to not see their dad for 3 weeks, but it is his decision to move away and now to change his schedule at the last minute, but he expects me to change my plans to accommodate him and thinks I am being unreasonable by saying no. He says his dad's 70th birthday is more important than my weekend away with friends, and that immediately makes me feel guilty, but I also feel like that is an unfair summation of the issue. It's not like he asked nicely and acknowledged that it would be a sacrifice either, and I feel so tired of feeling like I don't matter. AITA for taking a stand on this?To clarify: grandad's birthday is happening the one weekend and he had originally not planned to go to it (different city) but he had planned to visit the kids. The following weekend is my weekend away and he had originally was not going to be in town. So he wants to go to his dad instead of to the kids, and then I leave the kids at home and go away without them so that he can visit them that weekend instead.",

When we don’t immediately fix this problem, he starts flipping out, cursing at his mom and trying to get in her face.

I'm at university 5 days a week, 9:00 am to 5:00 pm; I'm never at home, including weekends, as I have a part-time job, also 9:00 am to 5:00 pm as I need to support myself.Three months before I became a PhD student, I was successful in purchasing my own house; the mortgage is £690.00 per month. Including the mortgage, the bills rack up to a total of £1,311.00. My income is around £2,300.00 per month. I've also got university costs to pay for, so after food, travel, and fees are deducted, I'm left with nothing for the month. I allowed my sister to move into my spare room. But I made sure she signed a tenancy agreement; for protection, I did state her rent is £400.00 per month. At first, I didn't chase this around. However, my sister is jobless; she sits in my house all day and is either on her devices, eating or sleeping. I come home every day, and when I do, it's cooking dinner, cleaning, and going to sleep. I don't feel it's fair to pay for 100% of the bills when I'm never in the first place. I've started requesting that my sister pay rent; she states every time she doesn't have it, and I'm keeping a record of how much arrears she's in.I've made a final offer: she either starts paying, or I'll evict her legally. She told my parents when I said that and they were pissed with me for threatening her with legal action. I've explained the only way I'll allow her to stay is if she gets a full-time job and pays half the monthly bills (I did add a clause in the rental agreement about this so I'm protected). I regret not making her pay sooner. My sister only wants a part-time job; she would be on minimum wage and have practically nothing at the end of the month. My family and I had a third argument about this; they called me an asshole as my sister is autistic; they said I'm being selfish because she's autistic and she wouldn't cope in the real world.AITA?

My boyfriend (Alan) of 2 years doesn’t like my best friend (although he has never met her).So the story. Jen, Tim and Sara were coming to where I live for Sara’s hockey tournament. Jen asked if they could stay with me for Thursday night but that they were staying with another friend for Friday and Saturday night. I said yes.I told Alan about them coming up and he was upset. Mostly cause I didn’t discuss things with him first before saying yes. Side note: me and my boyfriend don’t live together and I own my own house.Jen then reaches out and explains that they would rather stay at my place the whole weekend because they would feel more comfortable. I thought this was no big deal but Alan said that the whole situation made him uncomfortable, he didn’t want them staying there, and he thought it was weird. He asked me to tell them to either keep their original plans of staying with the other friend or get a hotel.I told him it was unreasonable to tell them to pay $500 for a hotel when they had a free place to stay. I said that while I was sorry it made him uncomfortable I wasn’t going to tell them they couldn’t stay at my place. I also told him that if it made him that uncomfortable he should come down and meet everyone and have a fun weekend. He declined.They ended up getting back to my place by 6pm on Friday night, I was on the phone with my boyfriend and I asked Sara how the hockey game went. At the same time Sara said “we lost”, Tim said “they suck” jokingly. Alan kind of lost it because he heard Tim’s voice and questioned where everyone was standing in the house, why Tim was hanging around upstairs and why if I was asking Sara a question was Tim answering. It turned into a fight and I hung up.We were all hungry so I said that I would make some supper. Alan called again and questioned what was going on and I told him I would be making supper. He again explained how uncomfortable all this made him and he couldn’t believe I was about to make supper for Tim and then sit down to eat with him. He gave me an ultimatum and said that if I cooked dinner our relationship would be over, I said “ok” because I thought it was ridiculous, he hung up with “I hope Tim was worth you losing this relationship over”.Sunday comes and everyone leaves and then Alan calls explaining that he was sorry and he shouldn’t have freaked out like he did.  He still says that after talking with multiple people including a professional (his family and his therapist) they agreed he was right and that because something made him that uncomfortable I should have told Sara about the situation and got her to find other accommodations.So AITA for not respecting my boyfriend boundaries when something made him uncomfortable?",

Cheers)I (M38) and my wife (F37) got into a (little) argument last week. She is going soon for a 3 weeks trip to the US (We are European) for some research studies in a prestigious school (unpaid and outside her work scope). I pushed her to take this opportunity and instead, will take care of the 2 boys back home (and just for the record, as I start seeing that people believe men don't take care of kids... where we live, I took more paternity leave and do most of the activities with them as I enjoy. So this not me being scared being with my boys :D).After these 3 weeks, I expected my wife to fly back directly to us. However, she asked me if she could fly to New York and visit the city for 3 days. She said it is her childhood dream and does not know if the opportunity will present itself again. I have told her that this is also a dream of mine and I would have liked to experience it with her, but now I will not.While she was talking about it, I felt really disappointed and sad that she would not like to come back asap to her family. I told her I disagree and I do not want her to fly to New York but instead fly back to us. She refused and said that she will book the tickets anyway.We are used to travel often for work (2-3 days) and we always take one extra day to visit. However, I just felt that this time 3 weeks is not 2-3 days.In some way, I feel angry at myself for thinking that my wife is selfish, but at the same time I believe I should not interfere with her dream. However,  I cannot stop thinking that I would not have behaved this way, especially after 3 weeks.I have now asked her to unbook her tickets, or else I will also book a 3 week trip abroad by myself when she is coming back.

	"body" : "Me (29) my fiancé (30) been dating for 5 years and have been to multiple weddings together throughout our relationship. We got engaged in April of 2023. The excitement from us and my family was through the roof. We could not wait to start wedding planning and got to it almost immediately.One of the biggest decisions you have to make when planning a wedding is who is going. From the beginning my fiancé decided on a black tie formal themed wedding. I was all for it that’s just type of girl she is and I wouldn’t expect anything less. Now what comes with a formal event like that is the audience. My family and extended family is very close knit. We have many large family gatherings throughout the year. We have had two wedding before our engagement on my side. For both weddings kids were not invited unless in the wedding. This where my problem starts.Me and fiancé decided on not having kids from the very beginning. My mother insisted that we would not exclude my aunts children who the oldest is a freshman in Highschool. The youngest is in the sixth grade. I never agreed to it with my mother and we had posted no children and adults only on our wedding website. My fiancé side of the family understood this decision without any question.We addressed my aunt and husband with just them on the save the date. We are at the home stretch of our wedding planning. Invites go out in 9 weeks. We had another family sit down and my mother berated me about not including the kids. Stating “that’s all I asked for” when I have accommodated everyone of her friends and husbands to our wedding. She threatened that my aunt will not go if the kids are not invited.I decided on reaching out to my aunt to clarify the confusion about her kids and stuck to the decision we made to not have kids. She did not respond instead called my mother and the berated ensued after again. The amount of guilt I have personally felt along with stress has made this part of the wedding planning miserable.Three days go by and I receive and text from my aunt stating; “ that excluding family due to age is an act of ageism and is as offensive as excluding someone of race, sexual orientation or political orientation.” And that they will not be attending. Wow. I have yet to respond but in my gut that response tells me everything I need to know to not invite them to the wedding . AITA?",

	"body" : "I WFH and my spouse stays home as well to take care of our 3 kids (2 toddlers and 1 infant). Every day when I come downstairs from work the house is a mess. Toys are scattered everywhere downstairs (living room, kitchen, entryway), food is caked onto the kitchen floor and the high chair from the infant, and dishes are left out with food hardening on them.In addition, things just start to pile up around the house over time from never being put away. Clothes are tossed on or at the base of the stairs until they are a huge pile, things that have been taken out are just left on the tables or countertops until those are piled up as well. Some of this stuff is kid items but some are also my spouse's items that are used and never put away. Our bedroom has food and trash everywhere and every night our bed has crumbs all over because our kids wake up (8-9 AM) and my spouse sends them downstairs to get food to eat in bed with them so my spouse can sleep more.Every few months we have people over for some reason or another and there is always a fight leading up to it because of the mess. It takes us multiple days of cleaning for hours a day to get the house in a state where we can have guests over. I get extremely frustrated because the bulk of our cleaning comes from cleaning up the accrued daily mess that happens while I am working.  We clean up for multiple days to have people over and within a week the house is back to where it looks like we never cleaned at all.I understand that being a stay at home spouse and caring for kids is a job in it's own right but I feel like part of that includes picking up after the kids so we aren't left with this giant mess constantly. If things were picked up throughout the day then we wouldn't have such a large list of things to do once the kids are in bed. I also feel that if you take something out to use, you put it away when you are done instead of leaving it on the counter.I'm not expecting my spouse to do things like clean the bathrooms or do all the dishes daily, just pick up after themselves and the kids during the day as they go.

Any time off she expected me to come visit her and got upset if I used that time for my now husband and/or friends. She would make me feel very guilty and I slowly realized if I hadn't moved away and spent this time with my peers, I may have never really grown up.I understand though. I'm her only child and I figured it was just “empty nest.” I'd come back for holidays and she would come to my sport meets A LOT. It was nice to have a supportive parent there.Things escalated when I started medical school. My free time was greatly reduced. I would still visit for holidays, but even then I still had to study. My mom didn't understand how important this was to me and how busy I had gotten, and actively guilt tripped me about the reduced time spent with her. I still did sports, but I stopped competing. It was too much. She continued to push for me to compete because that was how she got to spend time with me. I tried first year but after trying to study on planes and in air bnbs with bad internet, I realized it was unsustainable. We had a big fight and I set my boundaries. She did not take me seriously. My mom tried to manipulate me to continue competing and saying that I'm \"so smart\" I can afford to take time out of my studies to do fun things with her.I had enough and went NC with her for a few months before she finally came around. Maybe it was my dad (step dad who adopted me after they were married) who convinced her.They got divorced my second year of medical school, two months after I married my now husband.When my mom overstepped my very clear boundary about prioritizing my education over competing in her sport, we got into yet another fight. She said some awful things, including blaming me for marrying my step dad because she wanted me to be \"taken care of.\" Basically blaming me for her unhappy marriage. I think seeing how happy I was with my husband who is my best friend and biggest supporter put her over the edge.I am now four months from graduation, and we have one spare bedroom in our condo. My dad was very supportive throughout my education, and was always the voice of reason. He assumed I would pick my mom over him to stay with me and booked a hotel for the graduation weekend. My best friend from college was also super supportive, and wants to be there to see me graduate. I want her to stay with me because she's one of my best friends and I haven't seen her in over a year. My mom got extremely upset when I told her she was coming and I would host her. It came to light my mom expected me to host her and her new boyfriend at my condo. Her staying with me would make my graduation less pleasant, but she is my mom. So, AlTA for saying no?",

	"body" : "I (48F) met my husband (51M) 5 years ago, and we got married 2 years ago. Pretty early on in our relationship, he told me that he had 2 daughters with his ex-wife who are now 15 and 22, and were 11 and 18 when I met them. While he was telling me about them he mentioned that after he and his ex-wife split up, his older daughter Chelsea (Not her real name) blamed him and still does. I didn’t think much of it at the time and didn’t end up meeting either of them until a year later.The first time I met Chelsea was during a 4th of July party with my husband, both his daughters, his ex-wife and her husband and various friends. By that point I had already met my younger step daughter a few times and she and I actually hit it off pretty well. However Chelsea seemed upset and kept her distance from me the whole party, and when I tried to introduce myself or even talk to her she gave me very short answers, before going into the house (it was at her mother’s house) for the rest of the night.That is essentially how our entire relationship has been. I’ve known her for 4 years and in that time I don’t think I’ve had one friendly conversation with her, nor have I seen her have a nice conversation with my husband. Every time that my husband or I try to reach out to her to try to spend time or even talk to her, she’ll blow us off or directly tell us she doesn’t want to see us, and she has never spent any individual time with us. By which I mean she’s only around in group settings like parties and family events, etc and even then she’s very cold and distant towards both of us.When my husband and I got engaged, I called both Chelsea and her sister to tell them, and all Chelsea said was congratulations and then not to expect to see her at the wedding before hanging up. She ended up not attending the wedding at all.The straw that broke the camel’s back, however, was a few days ago when she walked by while I was on facetime with my husband’s younger daughter. I called her over and asked her about her graduation (she’s graduating from college this May). She once again blew me off and told me not to worry about it, and when I told her that my husband and I would be there she said she already knew who she was giving tickets to and that it wasn’t either of us.I snapped and told her she was being ridiculous and acting like a child and that her parents’ divorce was 14 years ago and she needs to get over it. She told me that she was over the divorce but that she’ll never get over her “father being a piece of shit” (her exact words). I was honestly speechless and she hung up the facetime before I could respond.My husband got a text from his ex-wife that night, telling him that if he wants to have a relationship with his younger daughter he needs to leave Chelsea alone and tell me to as well. My husband told me Chelsea has been this way towards him since she was 9, and we're not sure what to do and it would be helpful to get some outside perspective. AITA?",

Since I have lived in a dog free household or just with female dogs it hasn't been an issue, and we don't go to dog parks. On a leash he is perfectly well behaved when encountering male dogs.Now I live with my dog, my cousin (who is like my sister) as of October. She was taking care of her friend Mike's dog for the past year because he decided to go volunteer for some foreign legion in Ukraine. The other dog is very docile, lovely older dog, but a male. When we moved in, my cousin told me that Mike was coming back from Ukraine in December and that then the other dog would be gone.  In between that time, we had the dogs in the house, and there were a couple altercations between them so we eventually segregated the house with a baby gate and that was fine. Dave came to get the dog in December, all was well.This morning she tells me that Mike is dropping off his dog again today and going back to Ukraine, and doesn't know when he will be back. I am annoyed because 1. This dog wasn't supposed to be coming back at all and 2. They gave me no warning. Literally the dog will be here in an hour. I don't have a problem with the dog, he is very sweet, but my dog is definitely the problem. My cousin says that if I don't want to be stressed out by the baby gate and splitting the house I should just hire a behaviorist trainer...but that is very expensive and I have money troubles as it is! I told her that it's great that her friend is volunteering in Ukraine but ultimately unfair of him to dump his dog on us and he should find someone else or at the very least should have given us more time.She is annoyed saying that we need to be accommodating to Mike because he is doing good work in Ukraine...ok fine, that's awesome - but I still don't think this situation is fair!! I am not knocking his work, but the inconsideration of just leaving his dog with us when it was only supposed to be a few months!!

	"body" : "I am 22 and I took a huge step about six months ago and moved away from home to be with my partner (26). My parents (mom is 47, dad is 60) weren’t happy about it. They didn’t like it when I moved 35 miles away to go to a university, so now that I’m around 1,300 miles away, it’s a BIG deal for them and they call and text constantly. I’m genuinely shocked neither of them has tried to make me get Life360 or something, because they’re always asking where I am or what I’m doing and freaking out about every possible bad thing that could happen. It’s emotionally exhausting. Despite this, I do love my parents, and I try to maintain a good relationship with them.Ever since I moved, my mom has asked when she can come and visit. For those of you who have uprooted your life and moved hundreds of miles away, I’m sure you understand how stressful this is. I had to find a new job, get my new documents in order (license, insurance, etc), unpack my entire life, find a new routine, just a never ending list of tasks to get acclimated to this lovely new place.Anyway, she has finally settled on coming to visit in April, when she’ll be able to take leave from work for a bit. We started discussing activities and places to visit, and I told her which towns nearby would be the best places to get hotel rooms in, because I’m pretty sure that there’s nothing like that in my new town, as it’s so small. I told her if there were some vacancies in town, though, I’d keep an eye out and let her know. Things got awkward at this point, because she had apparently assumed she would stay with my partner and I in our apartment. I told that wouldn’t work, and when she asked why I provided all the reasons I could think of at the moment:If she gets a rental car, she can’t park in our driveway, there isn’t room.Overnight guests aren’t allowed in our lease.My partner and I want our privacy. This is our home, and we do not want to keep overnight guests.We don’t have the room to keep her. We have one bed and one bathroom.Her response to all of these was basically “BUT I’M YOUR MOTHER!” I told her I’m sorry, but we can’t host her overnight. She also has a habit of bringing her dog along with her when she says she won’t, and my partner and I aren’t allowed any pets in the apartment whatsoever. She’s angry with me and has since been accusing me of not loving or caring about her, that I’m ungrateful and selfish, and that I obviously don’t want to see her and just moved to get away from her. She also said that if we visited, someone would host us instead of making us get a room. I told her we would get a room anyway, because again, we prefer our privacy, and I’m pretty sure my relatives don’t want to host a queer couple anyways. My coming out last year had mixed reviews to say the least.After all of this, I’m wondering if I was really being an asshole here or if my mom is just unreasonable. AITA?",

	"body" : "For the past three years, my brother (25 M) and I (22 M) have exchanged Christmas/B-day gifts. We live in Canada and with the housing crisis, moving out isn't really an option. This year, he surprised me with a drone. I Spent $100 on a white Nike cap, brown Raptors Toque, Hat Organizer, and Leafs lanyard. He's always stressed about misplacing his hats and wants more that are my style.I was shocked when I opened the drone gift. I was also worried it was expensive, so I asked how much he spent. He reassured me that he spent a similar amount.However, I couldn't shake off the disappointment and anxiety, as I felt the drone wasn't something I'd use. I belive, he gets me things, he wants for himself. My brother admitted in front of me, my mom, and his girlfriend - that the gifts he buys me - are also something he can wear and use.I acted happy and grateful but my girlfriend sensed my discomfort, knowing this is something my brother would love and that I’ve never shown any interest in.Some Examples (you could skip this):He gave me bright Red 550 New Balances. He already has the exact same for himself in blue “he liked both so much and couldn’t pick so he got the red ones for me” - I later asked for a receipt to make an exchange, no receipt and he has worn them.One b-day he gave me Purple Vans with a “One Piece” design (this is his favourite anime). I enjoy the show but I've NEVER worn anything like this (I have a very minimalistic style, I can provide a link to the shoes). This 100% was something he wanted for himself (no receipt provided). At the time, I felt really bad bc I knew I wouldn't wear the shoes and he would notice. I thanked him for the gift. Later I told him how I felt and asked him to keep the vans (he was very happy and wears them everyday), while I kept my gift to him - a custom “One Piece” poster of his favourite character (he wanted posters for his room this year).For the past 3 years it's just been more of the same. I feel he doesn't put in effort, I ask for a receipt, and my family calls me ungrateful. While my gifts are always so personal to him.My girlfriends noticed this trend and how increasingly rude he's been with me over the years. I don't feel close with him - like she does with her younger brother (4 years apart, we're 3). My gf asked me to make this post bc I've been extremely conflictedMy parents call me ungrateful. Sometimes I think my brother gets me stuff he likes, thinking I'd like it too. However, it's difficult to communicate with my brother. He reacts angrily to simple requests for advice. He says he's a responsible older brother but I don’t even feel close with him. I can give more examples of other shitty things he doesSo, am I being the asshole by always asking for a receipt? And would I be the asshole again, if I ask to return the drone? I know that it will cause an argument/greater rift between us, and how my parents would react.Edit; Thought I'd provide more context about our relationsihp and why I feel so conflicted.I want a better relationship with my brother. Recently, when I think about how he treats me, I get depressed. When I compare our relationship to my gf and her brother (or other brothers), it's night and day. I'm not sure if what I'm thinking is right becuase my family always made me feel guilty.But I've been thinking he genuially treats me like shit. Recently, he wore my suede timberland boots (that I keep in prestien condition) and put a years worth of damage on them in 1 night. This is because I wore his hat. Salt was everywhere, deep scuffs, and creases. He didn't even bother cleaning them with our salt wipes. When we reff hockey together - he yells at me/trys to embarass me in front of our boses and strangers (this only happens w/ him - reffs are supposed to have each others back). I've also I told him nuermous times to stop. Our parents have overheard our arguments and are quick to tell me he doesn't know what he's doing, or just try to get us to stop.When I try telling him how he makes me feel, he literally could not care any less. He completely dismisses/ignores me. been like this since covid. he's also so quick to anger and ingores me to my face when I try talking to him. He acts like he can't hear me (as I stand right in front of him) and continues on his phone.For so long my family always tells me how I'm not responsible, consistently giving me shit. Rarley anything is said to him and they display him as a role model. I feel like this is a breaking point for me, but I honselty think I'm being a pos for feeling upset about his gits.",

We've had a strained relationship for a good portion of my life, despite him financially providing for me. My parents divorced when I was 15.Onto my dad. He works a difficult job as an executive at a tech company, and brings in at least half a million a year with bonuses. My mother works as an instructor at a local polytech, and we're well-off because of their hard work. He's been very emotionally withdrawn as long as I can remember, and has never told me he loves me or shown any affection. He's never been to a single school event, never driven me to school, never spent time with me, never showed any interest in me/achievements... and so on. Just a guy who lived in my house.My mother is, simply put, a superhero to me. She worked hard my entire life to provide me with a normal childhood and showed up to everything. She even broke her no-contact with my grandpa encourage him to attend my father-daughter events at school so I wouldn't feel out of place. She worked a 9-5, but still made me homecooked breakfast, lunches, and dinner. She tucked me in every night, called out of work to come to therapy with me, always noticed when something was wrong and magically made it better.A year the divorce, he started paying more attention to me. This coincided with him seeing a new woman (who is married with kids, and was a source of scandal in the family). This was shortly after I left an abusive relationship, where I was d. He stepped up on providing me with comfort and caring more than he ever did previously (I've had very poor mental health since I began grade school, and he never noticed, despite me having scars and being in hospitals often). He began taking a bigger parental role in my life, despite me living with my mom full time. However, his attempts were always half-hearted and I usually left feeling sour.This spring, I'm getting married to my highschool sweetheart, 20M. He's everything I've ever wanted, and knows about my relationship with my father. When I was worrying about whether I wanted him to be in the wedding party or not, he made the suggestion that my mother walk me down the aisle. I loved this idea, since she practically raised me on her own, and she was the one who also took my fiancé under her wing when we were younger.Yesterday, I had lunch with my father to invite him to the wedding, and he was surprised to hear I was getting married (even though fiancé and I have been engaged for a year, he was invited to the party but didn't attend as he was in Japan on a trip). I bit my tongue about it and let it slide, until he asked when he should arrive to walk me down the aisle. I broke the news to him that he wouldn't be the one doing it, and he got up silently and left. He has since not answered any calls or texts, even from my mom. I'm still planning on having her walk me down the aisle. WIBTA if he was only a guest?UPDATE: There is a character limit here, so the update is on AITAH.",

However, my cousin got married yesterday and didn’t invite my mother. This is the first wedding in my father’s side of the family since his passing. She got so upset about being left out. She was told that only important people were invited because it was an expensive venue. She called me to vent about it but all I felt was glad that now, I have no obligation to include them in life as such.",

Now that he’s collecting magick cards there’s decks all over the counters/table…I’m not only frustrated with the constant spending, but I’m frustrated that we have nowhere to put this stuff and he keeps getting into something new…I (31 female) just got really upset with him showing me another box of cards he just bought, and this is my primary reason…I AM 7 months pregnant…we already have two kids, in 3 months time I will be taking time off of work and I am self employed so every cent I’m making right now I’m saving. My shopping carts are full of things we need for a newborn, his is toys for himself/our son we have zero room for.I’m nesting, and hormonal, and incredibly overwhelmed with the cluttered space, as well as his spending. He always buys these things and tells me once it’s too late to rationalize with him, the money is already spent.I managed to get him to stop buying the action figures early in my pregnancy on this argument alone: we Don’t haven’t the space and right now we need to save not spend frivolously…that kept him at bay for the last 5 months, until this new passion arose. I’m just really frustrated and when he pulled out the box to show me what he bought I told him I didn’t even want to look at it, and that I was pissed…he tried to justify it saying it wasn’t that expensive, but neither are the things we actually need right now that I’m buying for the baby that’s coming…He ran off to the kitchen and started silently doing dishes, I’m sitting here having an internal quiet panic attack because he knows exactly how I feel about this right now and I honestly want to cry in frustration. I’m not sure if I overreacted or not, but we’ve literally had this conversation….he’s promised not to do it again without talking to me first already…so him promising that again is so empty to me.I’m so overwhelmed.",

I think African American and separately African culture is so beautiful and unique, and knowing the history of how they were treated, I would never try to make light of that.Anyways with that disclaimer out the way, I’ll get to the issue. So on tiktok there’s a trend of people showing their skin as like a 30 yr old without any botox or procedures etc. Me and my friends (all 17) were watching those, and one of my white friends commented that she started using retinol now to prevent her getting wrinkles by that age, and we all were just discussing skin care. like yeah those products help but like aging depends on ur genetics as well and stuff. So thats where everything went downhill.So like the title states im not black, but im South Indian so im a really dark brown, my skin tone is the same as Simone Ashley. My mum also has amazing skin like no wrinkles and shes in her 50’s, so I wanted to make a joke that since I have melanin Im not going to get wrinkles too. So I laughed and said im not worried because you know black dont crack and this is where I effed up.I said black because well dark brown doesn’t have the same effect. A few of my friends also giggled, but this other girl (a friend of a friend) who is white, basically called me a racist and said since Im not black I shouldn’t have said that. i basically defended myself back saying how am I racist, I didnt say anything offensive etc but we back and forth. I went home since, she really started going at me. At first I thought I did nothing wrong but now im kinda doubting myself because I did say black and well, im not. If im wrong im willing to take the L and apologise but I wanted to come on here and see what others think.Edit: because ppl are getting upset over my first line i want to clarify I know u can’t “identify” as black but you have people like Oli London who is white but “identifies” as Korean so I just wanted to make sure yall know I’m not trying to blackfish or anything.

He is a cash buyer, paying for the house in full using parents money, with no mortgage obligation. In a conversation we were having this weekend, he said that we wanted me to feel as though it was my house too, something that we were doing together, and feel as though I was able to contribute; I replied that of course I was very happy to contribute to the fair share of the bills, and that it would be great to start our life together.At this point, he said he was worried that I had misunderstood, and felt that he should be clear. He then suggested that he wants me to cover his share of the bills, and not just contribute my portion, in place of a 'rent' for living there, and so that he has to incur close-to-zero outgoings himself. I questioned why we couldn't just enter the house as equals, paying an equal share of the costs incurred as a result of living there: asking why I should 'pay his way,' and stated that I was uncomfortable in the power imbalance this would create, and that I would feel like I was 'renting off my boyfriend' and that he was trying to 'make money from me.'He questioned why his parents money should cover the cost of my \"rent,\" and claimed that I would be saving a great deal more money than if I was living in private rented accommodation (as I am now), which although is true, doesn't feel like a particularly nice position to be in, because as far as I see it, there isn't any \"rent\" to pay? At this point it was insinuated that I would be 'freeloader' if I didn'tThis argument/conversation went round and round, where neither of us could seemingly understand the others position, and ended with me feeling as though perhaps I was asking too much, and that I was trying to freeload off my boyfriend.. so tell me, AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for not wanting to pay my parents for a car they bought me",
	"body" : "I (f18) had a car that used to be my moms since I was 16. It was a 2010 and became no longer safe to drive (something was wrong with the axel? I don’t really know). The car was worth less than the amount it would have been to fix it. My parents graciously bought me a new car that I am very thankful for. They were set on this one used car that was a cheaper option and I was okay with that. While we were at the dealership to test drive, they saw a new one that we all really liked that was about $4000 more than they were planning on spending. When we got home I told them I was okay with either and I’m not gonna be picky since they are the ones buying it. They should just do what they think is right. The next week I was told I was getting the cheaper option but they came home with the new car. I was very happy and thankful that I had a car at all since I have to drive an hour everyday for work and I was ubering for the time being. They then told me they bought it in cash and SINCE they got the new car, I should pay them $500 by the end of the summer for it. That’s a bit under what I make in a week but I only work during the summer and a few weeks in the winter since I am a sophomore in college. The car is under my moms name, not mine. I am not sure if/when it will be transferred to mine but I am assuming when I’m done with college. I would be happy to pay any amount for it then since it will actually be mine. I have always paid for my own gas but they pay for my insurance. I If they had told me that the new car would cost me $500 beforehand, I would have made them get the cheaper option. I genuinely would have been fine with any car if it meant I didn’t have to pay and they knew that. I also go to school 8 hours away and as of now there is no point in me having a car on campus so I leave it at home. They also just don’t want me to bring it to school even if I wanted to since it would be a burden on my dad. I feel it is unfair for me to pay for a car when I can really only use it for 5 months out of the year. I wouldn’t mind paying for it when I am able to bring it to school since I will be the primary user. My dad also uses the car sometimes when I am at school since he doesn’t want to put miles on his. I also want to reiterate that my parents did not buy a new car out of the kindness of their hearts. It was obviously very nice of them to lend me a car at all but they got the new one because they want to show off to their friends. I am aware I am very fortunate for getting a car at all but AITA for refusing to pay for the car?Edit: the car is in my mom’s name for insurance reasons but they will switch it to my name once I’m out of school. They know I am very appreciative of the car but they wanted me to show my grate-fullness by paying. I would have been okay with literally any car that worked as I do not really care for materialistic items. They have always been into a flashy lifestyle and wanted to buy me a version of my previous car so it would look good in the driveway. I told them no since that would be ridiculous and I didn’t want to pay for premium gas. Even if I pay the $500 the car will NOT go in my name.Another edit: I know it sounds like I am super ungrateful and I am aware $500 for a new car is a great deal. That’s not the point. No one sat me down beforehand saying this is what was going to happen. I went into the whole car process under the impression I wouldn’t have to pay. That was the deal until they brought the NEW new car home. Then they decided I was gonna pay $500. If someone had told me beforehand, I would happily help out. The money is less of the problem than the fact that they sprung this on me without talking to me first. This makes me not want to pay anything.",

The problem comes in because I work a third shift job, I don't get home until 8am five days a week, and I then go straight to bed, which is the same time she starts to babysit the kids until about 6pm. The kids are VERY loud, especially while together (they like to not get along, especially the two 5 year olds) and it doesn't help that I am also a light sleeper. She doesn't do anything to keep them quiet, except just \"Shh\", but that obviously does not keep them quiet.So as a result, I have been getting woken up mid-sleep and having issues going back to sleep due to the noises which in return is causing issues at work because I stay so tired/sleepy all of the time.

When I confront her about it, she just says it's \"too out of the way\", and she wants to be at home. She gets irritated when I mention why she needs to go back to doing that because it's effecting my sleep nearly every single day of the week, but she shrugs me out basically saying \"I am doing the best that I can\".",

SIL also brought their new puppy, a corgi mix (cute but hyper and not yet trained) to stay with them while they were there.  It was all very chaotic and I was definitely overstimulated pretty much the moment we arrived.  This part is important because it supports why things happened the way they did later.  The dog kept jumping on my toddler and knocking him over.  MIL's house is pretty small and cramped with that many people in it so it leads to feeling like you're in the way no matter where you stand or sit.A little while later my son asks for a drink so we go to get his cup out of the diaper bag which my husband had packed.  I had distinctly asked him to pack a cup for a son on the way out the door and it hadn't made it into the bag.  I had also checked in on the way out the door and asked if we had everything.  I was kinda peeved not going to lie.  I was like \"Why didn't you pack a cup?\" Of course, he didn't know.  I sighed and we resigned to using this water bottle with a straw in it for seltzer.  Cue more interruptions and chaos with the dog and the baby combo.Husband comes back with the water bottle, opens the straw and immediate almost comical geyser of seltzer comes shooting out of the straw.  I was like \"Oh! you need to take the lid off and screw it back on with the straw up.\"  I look away due to more interruptions and cleaning up of the initial puddle of seltzer from the wood floor.  I look back up to my husband screwing the lid back on again with the straw down again.  \"You need to do it with the straw up! It's building pressure from the carbon dioxide being released when the straw is down and you need to put it on with the straw up!\"  He doesn't listen and makes a new puddle.I excuse myself to go to the bathroom.  I come back downstairs and there he is a third time screwing the lid onto the water bottle with the straw down.  I kinda lose it at this point and I'm like \"[Husband's name]! You need to take the lid off, raise the straw AND THEN screw the lid on with the straw UP so that the carbon dioxide doesn't build pressure inside of the water bottle!\"  Yes I said it kind of annoyed because it was literally the third time I had said this same thing.  SIL comes flying around the corner from the kitchen and starts yelling at me \"JUST SO YOU KNOW [Husband's name] YOU'RE NOT STUPID FOR NOT KNOWING THAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT EITHER!\" I immediately apologized, to no avail and it was super awkward. After dinner, BIL, SIL and SILF go upstairs and it's kinda obvious they're talking about me.  We leave.Last week, MIL invited my son and Hub over for dinner (which she never does) and proceeded to interrogate him about our relationship.  Essentially it's clear they think I'm an abusive ass.",

We were so excited to have a home that was officially ours, even if it was just a small 2 bedroom apartment. One thing we both agreed on was any visitors giving us a visit would also need to give us a heads up. We're not big on people showing up unexpectedly,  this is our home & we would like our privacy, which I think is understandable. Everyone has been respectful of this boundary...minus my boyfriends grandmother. She knows of our request about calling before showing up. But she acts like that boundary does not apply to her. She shows up unannounced, even as late as midnight with no warning. This has happened MULTIPLE times, no matter how many times we ask her not to. Fast forward a few weeks after she's done this numerous times, and I finally had enough. I told my boyfriend that any time she now shows up with no heads up, I will not be answering the door. (This applies to anyone showing up unannounced. She's just the only person who actually does.) She will just have to stand out there until she gets tired of knocking & leaves. He agreed this was the only way we could get it through her head. Side note, I don't mind her coming over. She's allowed to visit, as long as we have that heads up. But this has been going on for almost a year. Even after we told her we won't let her in if she shows up unannounced, that doesn't stop her from continuing to do it. I'm sure she thinks we'll cave, but so far we have not. I won't give in & reward her for disrespecting boundaries. We've been called rude & assholes for doing this, but I don't think I'm wrong for asking for a notice before someone shows up to our home, our safe space. All I asked was for my boundaries to be respected, and she can't do that, so now she has to suffer the consequences.So reddit, AITA?*ETA: I see a lot of comments asking if she has dementia or has been evaluated, so I'd just like to post here: her 2 sons have had her evaluated. Dr's believe nothing is wrong, there's no signs of dementia and claim there is nothing to be worried about. She is a very intrusive human being.

On the other hand, my daughter has not made peace with everything as she found out about the reasons behind the divorce later on and still has a hard time accepting what happened.At some point two years ago, my daughter reached out to me privately via email to unload everything she’s felt for over a decade and I had no clue what to say to it other than I couldn’t believe I caused this much pain. It was a novel of her feelings related to the divorce and how I went about everything related to being supportive of her hobbies, to how she felt staying at my house on the weekends, and even how I skipped her university graduation years ago, which I thought we moved past. My wife somehow saw the email and immediately texted my daughter telling her how horrible she is and how bad the email made her look because she hates being called a mistress.

	"body" : "I (20f) have a younger sister Maci (18f) who will be graduating high school in a few months. Maci and I do not have a relationship. Growing up with her was a struggle and as an adult who no longer lives with my parents I have not maintained any contact with Maci. This is something my parents understood and accepted until they mentioned wanting me home for the graduation and I refused.I will clarify the bad relationship before going more into the issue. I always struggled with school. I had a hard time as a kid and was very late diagnosed with audio processing disorder and dyslexia. My grades were terrible for a long time and Maci was the opposite. She didn't really have to try to get good grades. She's very intelligent and did great in school. She used to make fun of me and would call me dumb. She'd ask why I was so dumb and couldn't even do her homework right. Sometimes she would switch our homework out so I would need to work extra hard and long. I never noticed because of my struggles with reading. It was embarrassing and while she was punished, she never let up on me. It was all a big joke to her and she would tell me it was embarrassing to be my sister. She'd tell me how teachers would compliment her and say they were glad she was a better student than me. She even brought this up around people outside of our home and really went the extra mile.When I did eventually get diagnosed with learning disabilities, she called me the the slur that starts with r and said I should quit school because I would always be dumb. She also started to mock the way I was learning and trying to figure out reading better. My parents eventually just separated us completely during anything school related. They had us both in therapy. They punished her for it. But she would bring back up how embarrassing it was to be my sister.It took a lot for me to graduate and my final grades were nothing special. She made a social media post asking if people should celebrate graduating if they can't even get a C and have no hope for college. My parents were furious with her and they deleted her social media account for the stunt. But it was my breaking point I think.I walked away from the relationship with my sister and once I moved out did not speak to her like I said. My parents still feel like I should attend her graduation at a minimum because as she grows as a person I might regret it and she might feel like I no longer was open to a relationship at all. They told me I could go for the ceremony at least and I asked them why I should leave my life to support someone who finds it so embarrassing to be my sister.My parents argued that I'm older and should know people change a lot from their teens to adults. They said it would be wrong for me to miss this big moment for my sister. AITA?",

But at the same time i’m not her father or anything and don’t wanna be kind of bf that sees himself entitled to his partners body just because we are dating.***UPDATE: After gathering my thoughts, I sent her a long text starting by apologizing for not replying/ghosting her for 3-4 hours and that I did it to gather my thoughts and not say anything impulsive. Followed by how it is her choice and I did not have a say in this and apologized again if I pressured her into giving up on the procedure with silent treatment. Then I listed a long paragraph about how much I love the things she wanted to change and I am there for her to talk about with her insecurities if she wanted to etc.She almost immediatly apologized as well and said how she emphasized with me and how she would feel terrible if I tried to change my appearence and said all these time we spent distant(3 hours) made her realize she didn’t even want it in the beginning and would try to love herself as she is. I hope I didn’t pressure into something unintentionally but she seems happier now so am I. Thank you for all your insight.",

It distracted me from my workout and interrupted my zone out time.I tried gently explaining to Jess that working out is very personal time for me and I have a focused routine when I'm at the gym alone. I said we could certainly do a weekly yoga class or something else together, but I don't want to change my gym time.Jess got offended and said family should workout together and I'm excluding her. She claims she has been looking forward to be members at the same gym so we could motivate each other. I suggested alternatives, like yoga, hiking or running together on weekends, but she insists on joining this specific gym.My husband thinks I'm being selfish and should just let Jess sign up and work out with me a few days a week.

	"title" : "AITA for Getting My College Roommate Kicked Out",
	"body" : "I (18F) am currently a freshman in college. I moved into my dorm in August of last semester, and I got along quite well with my roommate (18F). However, upon leaving for winter break, she told me she would be transferring to a new school the following semester (this semester). I was saddened to hear this, as the last thing I wanted to do was start over with a brand new roommate. Two weeks ago, I arrived back on campus and went to my dorm to unpack.My new roommate (19F) had already arrived, and she was lying on my bed. Our dorm is about the size of a standard bedroom, with two beds side by side and two small desks at the foot of each bed. It's a pretty small space for two people. Anyway, I was confused as to why she was lying on my bed, as the other bed was completely empty and my bed still had my comforter and pillows on it. I informed her that this bed was mine, and asked if she wanted any help moving her things to the other side of the room. She then informed me that she wanted my bed because it was closer to the only window in the room. The reason being, she was from a rural area and wanted to feel more connected to nature. I told her that would be difficult, as all my belongings were already on my side of the room. She begrudgingly went to the other bed, so already not off to a great start. After a couple days of living with her, she would basically ignore me 24/7. My attempts to get to know her were fruitless. All of this culminated into a big fight around three days ago. I came back from class, ready to finish my homework and take a nap. To my horror, she had switched our beds. All of my belongings were strewn to the other side of the room. I was livid. I asked her why she would do such a thing without even talking to me first. She simply pretended she couldn't hear me. I went over to check on my stuff, and my framed picture of my deceased grandmother and I was SHATTERED. So, I started yelling at her.Finally, she gave in and yelled back at me, saying that I didn't understand how hard college was for her, since this was her first semester. She detailed that the window reminded her of her home in that she used to sit by her window at night to listen to the sounds of nature. I said I didn't care, that she couldn't mess with my stuff, and that I was going to go the RA about it. That thought seemed to scare her, because she begged me not to bring it up to anyone else. She explained how had she had very strict parents and therefore couldn't risk getting into trouble. I went to the RA anyway, and the matter was taken very seriously. This resulted in the two of us going to a meeting with the housing department. I explained to them my side of the story and showed them photographs of my damaged belongings. She basically had no defense, so they charged her for my damaged belongings and forced her to move to a different dorm. She cried. I have since heard from our RA that she has withdrawn from the university. So, AITA for bringing it to the RA?",

She told me to “suck it up and go” because my boyfriend is such a busy man so he shouldn’t be disappointed. I didn’t go, and he really wasn’t disappointed. He came over and took care of me. My mom didn’t talk to me for two weeks after this.She’s continued basically telling me to give him whatever he wants because “this is a once in a lifetime man for people like me”. Whatever that means. I find her new behaviour weird because she’s never done that with any of the guys I’ve dated so I asked about my own happiness and she basically said my happiness doesn’t matter because “this isn’t a regular joe”. He literally is though…She told me it’s better to cry in an aston than a ford (which I have had for 4 years). I’m not a car person all I care about is it gets me from point a to b so this meant nothing to me and I let her know it.She’s only met him once but referred to him as a “high value man”. Can someone explain what this means because I still don’t get it lol?I finally told her off when she basically told me to “ditch the feminist agenda” and go grovel and give my boyfriend sexual favours when HE was in the wrong. My mom waffled about how I should be playing the long game, I should keep him happy so I don’t have to sign a prenup and things like that. I couldn’t control my laughter which is rude but I just found it so ridiculous. I had to laugh. After I composed myself I firmly told her to stop giving me gold digging tips as she’s a failed gold digger herself, I firmly reiterated that I don’t *need* this man I *want* him.

I have been driving for 12 years and have always been happy to give friends and family a lift in my car if they struggle to get from A to B.My friend is autistic but still functional and is able to get public transport if need be and gets free bus travel and discounted rail travel because of her condition.For years I have given her a lift to and from her house, if we go on a day trip I’ll drive us there and back usually totalling in an hour long round trip etc.Over the past several years it has bothered me that she never offers to pay/split petrol or even offer to pay for parking for me doing all the driving. Me, her and 4 other friends (3 drivers, 3 non-drivers) were planning a trip into the capital (40mins there and back so 80mins round trip), and agreed to split the passengers evenly between 2 cars and decided to split the petrol bills evenly between passengers. When I said this to my friend she acted as though she didn’t need to pay and started arguing why she thought the split cost was too high and started comparing the price to how much her sister pays on fuel to the capital and back. I did explain that normally it’s good manners to split petrol costs and it’s not fair to expect to be chauffeured around for free all the time. Also petrol costs differ from car to car and depends on weight of passengers etc.We ended up not driving and got the train into the capital instead. Most likely a return ticket cost the same if not a little more than the initial shared petrol cost of £5 each.Basically I’ve stopped offering to give her lifts as I feel she isn’t paying her way and I don’t know if she doesn’t understand because of her autism or if she isn’t use to having to pay her way in life as she still lives with parents, had little to no bills to pay and has never had a job in her life and has always been on benefits for disability. Also her mum drives her most places if she can so she’s use to living an easy life.I feel this is a reasonable thing to ask if you are driving someone anywhere that isn’t local. Splitting petrol costs are the norm between driver and passengers and I explained that is what you’re doing when you pay to use public transport (more or less) so why is she unhappy to do it with friends?AITA and being unreasonable now that I have stopped giving her lifts in my car?",

I've noticed my sister is getting more and more stressed over the past couple of months. I figured it was just from her pregnancy since she didn't have a good pregnancy last time. Little did I know what was really happening.Her husband is a major gamer. He spends most of his free time on his video games when he's not working. As I mentioned before they already have one kid. Well, he never pays any attention to his daughter, he rather play video games. So much to the point when my sister leaves the house for something and leaves the baby behind, he doesn't even know that he is home alone with the baby! (she tells him before she leaves). He refuses to help her in any way. Won't change a dipar, won't help feed or bathe the baby, or even just watch the baby for two seconds so my pregnant sister can take a half-decent shower. My sister is a stay-at-home mom because he wanted her to be while he does hauling. Sometimes his job requires him to be gone for a couple of days. Last week he was gone on a trip for 2 nights. When he got back the first thing he told my sister was: \"Good the house is clean, I would have had to hurt you if it wasn't\". Now my sister said that he was joking but that's nothing to laugh about. He also has been yelling at her about not being the same person as she was when they first started dating. Even though after they got married and had their first kid, he stopped trying in all. He used to get up and make her breakfast or even run a bath for her when she got home from work. But doesn't do anything close to that anymore. He doesn't even help with the housework, saying it's my sister's job to get it done. When he comes home and the house is still a mess, he yells at her \"What the fuck have you been doing all day besides sitting on your ass, this house fucking stinks!\" with offering NO help! When my sister is stressed out and needs a hand, he doesn't even get up to help. instead, he just likes to say \"Oh what's wrong with you today, something is always wrong with you. You can do it, don't need my help\".His video games have gotten so bad that they are now in financial trouble. While my sister is struggling to keep the lights on he rather spend hundreds of dollars on his game. My sister spent $100 on the baby the other day and he yelled at her for spending too much money and that's why they are broke after he spent $80 on Roblox.

From the beginning, my husband and I had discussed me going back to work. He teleworks 100% of the time, and I telework 50% of the time, because my job requires me to be in the field some days. I thought we were on the same page about this until today, when I had to go back to work.My husband was pouting this morning. I asked him what was wrong, and he sighed, stating “do you really have to go back to work?” I was confused, because we’d talked about this already, and I’d been reminding him my maternity leave was ending so this shouldn’t have been a shock. We’d also worked out us being the primary caretaker of our daughter every other day (when I’m teleworking I’ll watch her) and I thought this was fair. He then proceeded to go on and on about “what if I get fired” and “how will I have time to work” and empathized that I should just be a stay at home mom.This is where I start to get frustrated. I have been caring for my daughter 95% of the time since her birth. When she was a newborn my husband used to leave me by myself with her so that he could go off to DJ somewhere, or go over to his friends house to make music. I was the one waking all the time, every night, to care for her. I was the one that did all the regressions, growth spurts, and leaps. My husband, in my opinion, has had it easy with our daughter up until now because I’m not around to jump in when he decides things are getting too hard for him to deal with. It’s even in his job description that he’s allowed to do childcare while he’s working so that’s not even a good excuse.Now where I may be the AH is that ultimately, this isn’t our infant daughter’s fault. She can’t feed or put herself to sleep on her own and I’m worried she’s going to be all out of wack from him caring for her because he doesn’t always pay attention, he’s relied on me to watch her. Now I don’t know if I should just quit my job so I can watch her. I guess what I’m saying is I may be an AH because my daughter needs me, if that makes sense. AITA?",

So I watch them from the time they get home from school til they go to bed and then I just wait around for her. This has been going on for like 3 months? And I get like $60 every 2 weeks. Sometimes nothing at all...However,,, the past 2 weeks I've been telling her no I don't want to watch them bc they don't listen no matter what I say, I barely get paid to watch them & she expects me to clean their house which is always disgusting.My mom says that I shouldn't tell her no bc she's family and she needs help. But I never agreed to be her full time babysitter and the only reason she makes me do it is because I'm a push over and she knows that she can pay me next to nothing and have me do whatever without me saying anything. Tbh I'm so fucking tired of it.Also there are always plenty of people on FB looking for babysitting jobs, she has plenty of friends and other family members who can do it so Ik she just doesn't have anyone else.So AITA for refusing to do it?Edited to say that when I tell her no she still just drops them off at my house. My parents aren't going to watch them so I'm still forced to do it anyways. So saying no doesn't really do anything.",

There’s child care provided at certain hours but some classes are after the care center closes.My (32f) gym buddy “Kat” wanted to take a pole dancing class but was too bashful to take it alone. She asked me to take a beginners class with her starting after the new year even though I’ve had some experience in the past. It is 6 weeks of 12 classes for $130 meeting at specific times. Our first two weeks of classes(2 classes a week) were mostly fine but Kat is really competitive and doesn’t like being the one that needs extra help at the gym however she was tolerating the investment.Classes are paid for on top of gym fees up front with no refunds even after missing a class.The incident happened in our fifth class. I had to bring my baby (7 months). Over the years I’ve seen women bring babies after hours at times so it wasn’t entirely abnormal, mine was in his carrier asleep along the wall for the beginning of class but he woke up toward the end and earned himself a lot of attention.One of the younger gals(Early 20s) was “uncomfortable being so dressed down in front of a boy” wearing cheeky spanks and a sports bra. I told her she could wear more if she wanted. She argued back “or you could take him home so he’s not over here oogling us” I laughed as I told her with sarcasm “you’re more likely to get ogled by me than my baby.”That shut her up.Later Kat said she was embarrassed by the scene and wished I hadn’t come with my son in the first place sliding in a jab “it’s not like you need the class anyway.” This hurt me because when I was 18 my dad cut me off financially ‘for being gay’ and I put my gymnast/dance background to use dancing exotically. She knows it.So it actually hurt me and fairly deeply.I asked why she would say that and she said she was “so embarrassed” she no longer wants to go to class with me. I asked her again, why she was so embarrassed and she stated I ‘came out’. I didn’t. Yes she already knew I was married to a woman and no she never had a problem with it.I told her I’m not going to stop going when it’s already been paid for.

He's is asking me about my school. I tell him about how I switched into software and how I am currently looking for an internship this summer but it has been hard since I'm new to programming and don't have that much experience.He has the audacity to go on and say stuff like \"Why would you choose software engineering? most people in there have been coding since they were 10 and are way more experienced than you... there NO WAY you'll be successful even trying your best. I mean... only like 5% truly make it. Its basically impossible for you. Why didnt you choose something easier that you actually have a chance at succeeding in. I dont mean to discourage, Im just being realistic. You know me.. i dont like to sugarcoat and im telling you now you cant do it\" After have a brief conversation with him about this where he just goes ON and ON about how I cant do well. I get frustrated and without saying anything else i leave the room and go to my room upstairs.At this point I was FUMING, i could feel my blood boiling but they only thing I could really do was sit there and cry. So there I am in my room bawling my eyes out because I didnt know what else to do.Then, I heard the conversation he is having with my parents downstairs and he said verbatim \"shes an entitled whiny b*tch\" ... \"her brother is better than her\" ... \" she wont be successful like her brother\" ... etc etc. literally AWFUL things. Now, if you know anything about me, you know that my academics/career means EVERYTHING to me. Ive worked incredibly hard to get to where I am and have the grades that I do. Also, the topic of comparing success between my brother and I is a touchy subject for me.So at this point I was so angry in my room listening to him say this. Worst of all my parents were listening and didnt defend me at all. I got so angry listening to this, I opened my door and yelled \"STFU\", then my uncle comes upstairs and starts yelling at me saying \"you are entitled and spoiled and act like the world revolves around you. you will never amount to anything and i'm saying this because its what you need to hear\" me and him are in a screaming match for a bit. in front of his wife and kids I say \"GTFO, I dont wanna hear whatever it is you have to say.

I’m having trouble wrapping my head around his resistance for doing nice things for me.I told him if he asked me to do the same of course I would because I want to make him happy and I know it’s something he’d appreciate. He said he would never ask me to do that though, because he’s perfectly capable of doing it himself.Am I letting my ego show?

I’ll clean his apartment when he’s at work, make the bed for him even though it’s not something he does for himself, etc. I think this might be why I didn’t think it was the biggest deal to ask him to do a favor for me.”Edit 3 (and most likely final): A lot more people have chimed into this post than I initially expected. I’ve been trying to respond to people who have (mostly) civil.Wanted to clear a few things up: A lot of people have been mentioning I am “playing mind games” by asking if he could get me a glass of water. While I can’t know for sure if that’s what I was doing subconsciously, I promise it was not that deep lol. It was such a fleeting moment. To me I was just asking a favor, just as he has asked me in other scenarios.I didn’t demand, I asked. And he said sure. A LOT of assumptions are being made about the type of people my boyfriend and I are. If you need more info, just ask me to clarify and I’ll be upfront and honest. It’s crazy to me that people are assuming I “constantly nag” and am “purposefully manipulating” him. Same goes for my boyfriend, please don’t assume he’s a terrible person I should just ditch. After reading through the comments, I think at the end of the day we show our love in different ways. A lot of people have been saying my love language is acts of service and it made sense to me.Edit 4: Forgot to mention another assumption being made. This is my fault for not being clear in the comments. We weren’t laying in bed saying our goodnights with the lights out. We were watching TV and both occasionally getting up to go to the bathroom or something like that. Not sure if this makes a difference for people.",

About halfway through my way back my dad called me and said he needs a car to get groceries. I told him I’m on my way back and I'll be there in an hour or so. He said I should hurry up and was displeased that I took the suburban even though he gave it to me.So when I came back he was even more annoyed because he took the corvette and ofc had chronic pain flair up. He said I loaded the fridge wrong and the cooling fluid could of spilled. It did not spill btw. Also he said that it was an ah move of me to take the only car he could drive even though he said I should take it and I should haul the fridge.Now I feel like ta because I took the only accessible car. On the other side he told me to take this car because he knew I won’t be able to load the fridge into the corvette. Also he needed the fridge to be hauled on that exact day.",

	"title" : "AITA for wanting my brother to move out",
	"body" : "Me(18F) & my older brother(26M) argue constantly over small disagreements, it usually stems from him trying to “parent me” in some sense. We both live under my fathers roof & it was agreed that once we finish school we pay rent or move out. I haven’t finished school yet & I'm planning to go to college as well. My brother has been finished school for a while now &  he is jobless at the moment. He has his own family & my father told him and his gf(24) that he could live with us until he got his feet planted on the ground which is pretty understandable cuz he became a father at 21. The issue is that he has had his feet on the ground for a very long time & he had a position that payed very well & he made it clear to me the other day that he “has enough money to start a business” so it made question why he has the money for that but not the money to afford a mortgage. It’s no shocker he has money saved up because he doesn’t pay my father rent & neither does his gf. They live in the basement, 1 of the bedrooms was turned into a gaming room, my brother's bedroom was turned into their kids room & the guest bedroom is being used by my brother's girlfriend's sister(who also doesn’t pay rent) & then they turned the living room into their bedroom. So there’s not even enough rooms for all of them living down there. They leave messes in the kitchen & expect me to clean up after it. If I leave a plate or 2 in the sink he yells at me to clean it up but that means I have to clean their dishes so I've refused to clean them up a couple times. My father works week on week off & the house usually gets a big clean up before he’s home but they expect me to clean up all of upstairs even though i’m pretty much confined to my room everyday, i eat my meals in my room, i clean my messes up in the kitchen & so on. You might as well call me Cinderella at this point because all I do is clean up after everybody else. I love my brother & his family don’t get me wrong but it's unfair on me, i can’t have the kitchen between 5-7pm every night, if i want to clean my dishes i have to put all of theirs away so there’s room for mine, i have to be quiet in the evenings because their room has no walls and they can hear me. Me & my father had conversations about him moving out & my brother overheard me & my dad’s conversation, he later told me I was “stabbing him in the back” because I agreed with my dad kicking them out. I feel like an asshole agreeing with my dad but at the same time i think he’s old enough to move out & considering he said he has enough money to start a business i’m sure he won’t be homeless, there’s also 3 adults so i’m sure they could put their money together & buy a place. I honestly really wouldn’t have a problem with them if my brother didn’t try to parent me and speak to me like i’m less than him but it’s beginning to get to me, and even in situations where he’s wrong he and his gf will “gang up” on me.",

	"body" : "Three people live in the house but I am the one with the lease under my name. It’s me (24f) my boyfriend (24m) and his brother (21m) let’s call them Jack and Dave. Jack and I moved in three years ago almost and Dave moved in two years ago under the condition that he has a job pays his rent and take the trash out. Dave has a girlfriend Miley (18f). Miley is extremely different than me and that’s okay. Jack and I are introverts who like quiet and to be weird in the peace and quiet of our own home. Dave is a sometimes introvert sometimes extrovert and it worked well with us till his girlfriend started coming around. Miley is a princess. She has to have her way or it’s a scream crying temper tantrum. We don’t like to stick our nose in their relationship because it’s their relationship we don’t know the intimate details of it and we don’t need to. I grew up in an extremely dysfunctional family so I like to have my peace and quiet it’s helped me fix myself a lot. But with Miley coming around I’m picking up my old bad habits. I also lost my only grandma and my dad in the space of three months in the end of the last year so things have been stressful to say the least. Miley has been at the house for the last three weeks non stop. When I lost my grandma I asked Dave if Miley could maybe not come over for the night because I was grieving and extremely upset. That ended with Dave “putting his foot down” and Miley was still there and had a scream tantrum over him not making her ramen right. When my dad passed I wasn’t as upset he was a horrible person but he was still my dad and Miley was to busy to be there so I got the quiet I needed. Dave doesn’t have a job right now and it’s not his fault but Jack and I are paying for everything. The grocery bill has gone up because Miley is an extremely picky eater and I refuse to let people go hungry in my home but that means we basically have 30$ for two weeks to make it to and from work. Jack and I are extremely stressed right now and the scream tantrums are not helping. This morning I put my car in a ditch to prevent an accident Jack and I are fine and so is the car but we had to pay 150 to get us pulled out so we really have nothing except things Miley won’t eat and I can’t stand another scream tantrum so I asked Dave if Miley could go home and sent him pictures of the car in a ditch saying we’re extremely stressed and if Miley could go home for the night just tonight. We haven’t received an anwser but god I don’t want to go home if she’s there I can’t stand another scream tantrum or to hear her whiny voice as she cusses him out for something she herself can do on her own. Am I the asshole for asking her to just go home for one single night. I feel like I’m the asshole because he does have a say on who’s in the house seeing as he does live there but two of the three are saying go home and one is being stubborn and ignoring the house vote.Edit: we did give Dave a warning that if he did not have a job by February first he has to leave. We did that over a month ago so he will be gone soon. Dave lost his job due to a Karen loosing their mind over gas not pumping fast enough. Jack and Dave are subtenants as well.",

For context, my best friend is asian, and I am half asian-half black, and their friend is a white Mexican. I've always been mildly uncomfortable around this friend, but I've always made the effort to be their friend and nice even when they've been otherwise rude to me. In the past this friend as always made very toeing the line of racist energy jokes, but nothing too crazy or insane. Just a passing quip of \"It's because your asian\" Or bringing up the fact that one of us in the group is asian in banter. Which had always been uncomfortable but we assumed was her trying to do shock value comedy. Recently however, this friend and I and my best friend got in a car together and she actually started getting really racist. Saying \"I hate Chinese people,\" \"shutup darkie,\" \"shutup you're literally fillipino,\" \"stop squinting your eyes\" etcetera. At the moment I was too shocked to say anything, so I laughed it off uncomfortably and made a few quips back, poking at her for making racist jokes. My friend in the front seat remaining quiet through out it. The immediate day after I get in the car with the same group of people, this time including my black friend, and she whips around and goes and I quote \"who let this Blackie in the car\" and when I comment how dangerously close she's getting to saying the n word, she tells me to \"shut the f up darkie\" and again my asian best friend says not a word. A day or two after that my best friend makes a joke about how racist her friend is, and it really makes me feel like she isn't as bothered about these comments as I am. Most of the comments were made towards me, but some were towards herself as well. I'm thinking about telling her straight up I don't want to be around her friend anymore, but I don't know how she's going to react. In the past she's told me she isn't as close to this other friend and us closer to me, but lately she's done nothing but prioritize and hang out with this friend, and didn't even stick up for me in her own car? In the past people in our group had said way less offensive borderline racist things and she immediately clapped back at them and unforgiving cut them off, but with her other best friend suddenly it's okay?",

He's always had a ton of girlfriends, or just random girls he met at bars over at our place when I was younger, they were always gorgeous and i remember them always spoiling me with sweets, or doing my make up etc.Not too long ago, Liam married a woman (Meg, 36) he had met at work. It's awful, we had to move to her house, which resulted in me having move schools to one where I have no friends. She's always moaning about me. They're also expecting a baby in April, which I am dreading. Meg despises me, I'm pretty sure. She's making me follow all the rules she's created (no make up, no dressing how i want, no diets or going out), and she always talks bad about me to my dad. She's totally changed him as well, he just acts old and dresses not at all like himself - he's boring now, nothing like what he used to beThe other day, Meg and I got into an argument about my uniform. I rolled my skirt up a bit and I had make-up as well as fake nails on. She came into my room and started yelling, tell me to put my skirt down and take my make up off, I yelled back that everyone has their skirt rolled up, and that i'm not taking my make up off because most of it is minimal. Besides, Dad did take me to get lash extensions, so I can't just take them out.Liam ended up getting involved, he said to me that i shouldn't rile my step-mam up and just to 'roll the damn skirt down'. I then told him that it's not my fault he's not attractive anymore and had to settle for   Meg, and he shouldn't let her think she's my mam now.Since then, dad's been short with me for insulting him and his wife, and Meg has been even harder on me, saying that they got married because she is a decent, responsible woman and not because she looks like a doll.

And that they spend it stupidly, which they sometimes do, but it’s their money.I don’t really do thatMy dad decided to move six hours away to an isolated location, and purchased my sister a property for hundreds of thousands of dollars to convince her to come. With the impression she would live there. She INSISTED it be put in her name. He offered me the same opportunity, but I knew I would never want to live there in a million years and I didnt want to put anyone in a bad position.Turns out they didn’t have money to build on it and that there’s a crazy neighbour who makes the experience miserable. So she decided not to live there and is attempting to sell it. I don’t believe she ever really intended to live there full time and planned to Airbnb it out.So my dad offered me hundreds of thousands of dollars later in a way to make it fair, since he spent the same on my sisters property. Just straight cash. Fuck it. I used quite a huge chunk as a down payment for my first home. My mortgage payments are low and I’m very very happy with it.I was honest with my sister about this. She was not super thrilled. She now thinks the situation is unfair as I had a choice in how the money was spent and she didn’t. My dad said he feels tricked and that she lied to him about wanting to live up there. She thinks as a way to make it fair my dad should now purchase this property off her for $400,000.

The apartment is three floors and a bedroom is on every floor.  We have a private rooftop and the first and second floor bedrooms have their own balcony.  I live on the second floor with my cat and share a bathroom with the first floor roommate (we'll call her Drew).  The third floor roommate (we'll call her Jennifer) has her own bathroom and has direct access to the private rooftop.  The kitchen is small and we don't have a dishwasher.My roommates, in particular Drew, don't seem to have the same mindset of cleaning dishes same night or at least rinsing out your dishes.  If they cook, they will stuff the sink with all of their dishes.  If I do have a night where I leave a pot to soak and they cook after, then the dishes I have to get to will get buried underneath.  They tend to not rinse out their food so I have to stick my hand inside to get to my dishes which grosses me out.  Or I have to do everyone's dishes in the sink as an alternative.  The turnaround time for dishes tends to be 2-3 days for them or they do it when they are off from work on their weekends. This past week a dish with lasagna remnants was to the side of the sink for three days. It smelled.Drew and Jennifer are deathly afraid of bugs--and we have had roaches.  I have a cat and don't want her to exposed to any harsh chemicals, so I wipe down crumbs and counters often.  Drew in particular will leave her food bowls with food in them either in her room or in the common room space for a day or two before she will put them to the side of the sink, which adds it to the dish queue.I have mostly just rolled with their process, especially since Drew had a rough year--her grandfather passed away and she was unemployed for a few months.  Lately though, I've found I can't do it anymore.  I texted them asking if we could try doing a little bit of the dishes every day and if we could commit to wiping down counters since Drew left the counter covered after cooking that night before.  It felt like a simple ask but Drew said no and that she couldn't commit to doing that everyday as she was tired after work often.  They both jumped in to say that they had never seen me do all the dishes (I do my own and then do only a few of theirs as a courtesy), so it was unfair of me to bring up cleaning.  I take out the kitchen trash frequently, take out recycling every three days and for the shared bathroom Drew has only taken out the trash once--often stuffing her used pads at the top if the rest of the trash is full.  Asking for the change, felt to them as an attack and I'm not sure if I am in the wrong for only washing my own dishes and not doing the whole sink.  They're confused as to why I'm bringing it up now and not before as well, so that is also a point of tension for them.AITA?",

	"body" : "I have three kids: Annie 25F, Ben 23M and Cal 17M. When Annie was going to college, she got an offer from her dream college.Unfortunately they didn’t offer enough financial aid that meant it was viable for her to attend, so she settled for her backup, still an Ivy League, but she was upset for sometime about not being able to attend her dream college. At the time, me and my husband couldn’t support her at the dream school as we had crazy overhead costs. We did contribute what we can, but asked Annie to work part time.Even after the financial aid, Annie worked a job to go towards her rent and this has meant her studies suffered. She had to defer some of her classes to sit them in the summer. She has now since graduated and landed a good job.Ben wasn’t fussed about where he got into and he did well at high school, and got a full ride scholarship, so we didn’t pay for his tuition. Occasionally I sent him money to spend on himself.Cal is my youngest and as its been a few years since Annie went to college, me and my husband are in a better financial position to support where he wants to go. Cal got many offers and picked his first choice. He was eligible for some financial aid, but the majority will be out of pocket. As we didn’t contribute for Ben’s tuition, we are able to send Cal to a more prestigious school.When Cal announced this news at a family dinner, Annie got upset that Cal gets to go to his dream school and accused us of favourites. I tried explaining the situation was different, we can afford it now, as we didn’t pay for Ben so can use it on Cal. We set aside equal 1/3rds for the kids, but as our kids have grown, our savings for the youngest two have increased. AITA?eta- We did sponsor some on Annie’s masters program cost. So in my head",

	"title" : "AITA for not allowing my sons to go on a weekend trip together?",
	"body" : "I (46M) have three sons but this regards the two older ones, Riley (24M) and Adam (16M).Riley and Adam have a normal brotherly relationship. They’re always ‘fighting’ (jokingly), steal eachothers shit etc. When they were younger, Riley did used to pick on Adam but my wife and i resolved it.For the past year or so, they’ve really gotten closer. Adam has always been a quiet child and Riley is the textbook extrovert and he’s really helped his younger brother come out of his shell. Adam has a twin sister, Kate, who is equally as extroverted as Riley but i think that gaining that bond with his older brother is what helped him change. Growing up, Adam and Kate fell into the ‘loud twin and quiet twin’ roles so i think his new closeness with Riley is what helped.A few weeks ago, Riley asked me if he could take Adam with him on a weekend trip with his friends who are all 22-26. Now, when i was younger, i used to take my younger brother on trips with my friends but we only have a 3 year age gap, not 8. And my younger brother was not as anti-social as Adam tends to get. Plus, sometimes the boys take it too far when messing with each other and my wife and i have to intervene before they actually get upset with each other.As much as i love Riley, he is also not the type of person you can entrust a person to—i wouldn’t even trust him with a goldfish. He’s the type of person who forgets to eat and take meds and Adam is hypoglycemic and because of his social anxiety, I don’t think he’d take himself to the kitchen in the apartment they’ll be renting for the trip if there are other people there. I’d maybe feel safer if Kate went too, but i don’t want to send my daughter on a trip with a bunch of guys.For these reasons, i said no and i told them why in a watered down way. He accused me of not trusting him and Adam to behave themselves and is currently very upset with me. Adam is also pretty annoyed with me for ‘treating him a child’. Adam has also never been on a sleepover before (his choice) and i don’t understand why both of them aren’t atleast trying to understand my perspective.AITA?",

She said that she feels horrible that we can't have a relationship because of her wrong doings. She begged us and we told her no and hung up.A couple of minutes later, my half brother reached out to me on instagram saying that he really wants to meet us and that it'll make his day if we do. He said that he always wanted siblings and doesn't understand why we wouldn't want to meet him. I read it but didn't reply. I talked to my dad and brother about it and my brother says that he feels sad for our brother but he still doesn't want to go. We haven't seen our mom in person in years and it'll be weird if we go.

	"title" : "AITA for throwing my mom’s food away?",
	"body" : "I (30F) do not live with my mom (58F) anymore, but every 3 or so months I will visit (besides regular visits) to throw expired food and medication away, and then I immediately buy replacements.My mom hates to see me throwing “good food” away, so against my best judgement I take the expired food and donate to the homeless. I live in a very poor country and there is always someone happy to take the food.I don’t like the idea that I am giving expired food to someone, but if I don’t, my mom will get extremely upset. Even with this arrangement she is still resentful.I don’t understand why she gets so upset that I replace her expired items with the exact same items, and then donate them. I understand she might not like that I go through her stuff, or takes it personal, but in my mind I care for her and her health by making sure she is not ingesting anything that can make her sick.I also buy new food with my own money, so it comes to no expenses of her own.I appreciate the advices!Edit: in my country there is not “expired” or “best buy” distinction, just “valid until” labels - meat, vegetables, canned goods, oils, tea, everything has a “valid until” which is the date up until the producer will take responsibility for the good. I understand some items will still be healthy to eat after the “valid until” date but I don’t want my mom taking the riskEdit2: i see many questions about how “off” are the foods so I suppose it would be good to give examples: if it’s canned she can store the goods for way past a year, anything that doesn’t “look” expired will stay until it’s all used up, regardless of expiration dates. Less durable foods like some chemical condiments, soda, sausages, ketchup etc she will keep past the expiration if they smell / taste ok. Bread and fruits she will cut the mold off. My problem with all of this is that the expiration date also accounts for bacteria and contaminants that are invisible to the naked eye. For example, a bottle of water has an expiration date because the plastic expires. So there is no obvious right and wrong for me in terms of what’s still good or not. To prevent any problems, I will throw away anything that is DEFINITELY moldy / ruined / spoiled and will donate things that are not obviously spoiled, but are past the expiration date and I don’t feel safe letting my mom eat them when she can have new ones. The things I replace are mostly cooking oils, rice, coffee, sausage, butter. Sometimes I throw away yogurt, soda. And rarely I will need to replace teas, pasta, sauces, condiments. My mom also buys a lot of things she doesn’t use so often, so it’s easy to find an expired item that I would not replace or ask her if she really needs it replaced. I avoid buying too many things and I don’t like this process and would prefer if less food is thrown away every time we go through this",

I gave her an extra 150 because I wanted her to be able to get a nicer tattoo. She gets her tattoo, it cost 220, she tipped her artist 20 bucks, and she pocketed the rest. I went to the shop the next day to talk to someone about an appointment, and I set up an appointment with the apprentice of the shop. She is a younger woman, who’s only been tattooing for a year. I come in a few weeks later, and my girlfriend insists she comes with. So I bring her with me, walk in, and the artist starts showing me the design she made for me, which I LOVED. My girlfriend chose to stay in the lobby while I get the tattoo done.So I sit down in the chair. And my artist strikes up a conversation. She asks the meaning of the tattoo, and I explain it, and I notice a Berserk painting, so I strike up a conversation about berserk. About twenty minutes into the tattoo, I get a text from my girlfriend, which said,”will you stop yapping? She doesn’t wanna hear your life story”. This bothers me a bit but she’s just sorta like that, so I apologize and sit quietly for a bit, but then the artist started asking about if I’ve read a certain comic book. And we start conversing again. About 10 minutes after that when the outline of the tattoo is done, the artist gets up to go grab my girlfriend out of the lobby, and she’s asleep, with her hands covering her ears. She comes back and explains, and I said,”she did say she was tired, I feel bad for dragging her along” despite her wanting to come with me.Before this next part, I will note that during conversation my artist brought up that she had a wife, so she was married, and not into dudes.After the tattoo is finished, I go out there and wake her up as I’m about to pay for the tattoo, and the artist told me it would cost 160. I was under the impression it would have been more of a 250 tattoo, so I tipped sixty dollars because the art was amazing, she was very quick, and the conversation she kept with me made me almost forget I was getting tattooed in the first place. Once we get back to the car, my girlfriend loses it, and essentially explains that a 60 dollar tip is for if you’re trying to fuck your artist, and that I needed to shut the fuck up because the artist didn’t even care and that I NEVER try to talk to her about the things I talked about with the artist (I have tried, she just has blatantly expressed annoyance and disinterest in said things), and even said that she was hoping I saw her hands covering her ears because it was so annoying for her.It’s been three days now, and she is still reminding me that I essentially cheated on her by tipping that much.

Ever since then, it's like she's been more and more focussed on material stuff (fancy bags, makeup, etc.) and appearances than her actual kids, and, although I ignored it at first, it really started rubbing me the wrong way.Once or twice, I have seen her send her children (we'll call them Mikayla, Jane, and Evelyn), into a different room because they accidentally spilled juice on/dirtied their clothes (not to change, but to be away from everyone else). When I say clothes, I really mean dresses, because I don't think she lets my cousins wear anything but plain pastel or white dresses, even though they're young (3-6) and will probably get them dirty quickly.I told my brother (15M) about how I felt bad for our cousins, and he told me to shrug it off because our aunt was \"probably just grieving in her own way\", and that I should \"let her be\", because I'd probably do more harm than good. I understand that grieving can be hard, but it's been almost a year and I don't think our cousins really have anyone to speak to.This weekend, we were over at my grandma's house for a barbeque to celebrate Mikayla's 6th birthday, and I thought that maybe my aunt wouldn't be as distant today, since we were celebrating her daughter. I thought everything was fine, until we went outside for the barbeque.Since Mikayla was the birthday girl, she got to choose what piece she wanted before everyone else. She chose a piece and my aunt immediately cut in and told her no, because she'd ruin the dress she was wearing. I told my aunt that the purpose of the barbeque was to have fun for my cousin's birthday, and that she was being too strict.She told me it wasn't my problem, and I told her Mikayla was my cousin and she clearly wasn't happy, so it really was. This turned into a full on argument and she said that \"just because you live in the dirt, doesn't mean my kids should\".

My step dad would continually tell me things like \"you're not a part of this family anymore\" and insults like \"you're the fat kid\".My breaking point was when they took all my stuff and packed it up into boxes while I was away at my dad's house, and changed my bedroom into a storage room/office space for them, and told me I had to either sleep on the floor or the couch. They also told me that once they do clean that room out, it would be for a foster kid. One weekend they cleared off the bed in that room and told me I could sleep in there, but the next morning my step dad goes in the room while I'm trying to sleep and turns all the lights on and calls his friends while playing video games. When I asked him to leave he told me that if I don't like it I can get out. My mom was away from the house at the time and I messaged her telling her what happened, hoping she would stick up for me, but she told me that I needed to stop being ungrateful. So I called my dad to come pick me up and I left, and I haven't been back since.I'm now 18 and I'm going to be graduating high school in a couple of months. My mom still tries to contact me and apologize for everything that had happen, but I dont reply. My step-mom told me that I should try to fix my relationship with my mother, so I don't regret it when she's not there for my graduation, but I have no desire to talk to her.So AITA for not inviting my mom to my graduation and not trying to fix our broken relationship?",

	"body" : "(For context, we live in a college town where parking generally is pretty difficult and most places have either visitor parking, or metered parking).EDIT: (FURTHER CONTEXT, my apartment has designated yellow visitor parking spots. Most of my friends know this since they have been here before, although he's been here a lot more.)My friend and I were getting together to play a card game, and we decided to do it at my place (an apartment) rather than his (a house that he rents). There wasn't really any reason; I just didn't want to drive and asked him to come over instead and he said sure. He's been to my place multiple times before but not for extended periods of time or when I pick him up.After we decide to call it a night, he asks me \"Your apartment doesn't tow, right?\" to which I respond \"Yes, they do. I saw someone being towed recently.\" He goes outside and he doesn't have a car. He comes back in and instead of asking what we should do about this, he flat up tells me multiple times that I will be paying the whole amount.I understood he was upset so I didn't argue or respond really, I just dropped him off at the towing place as he wanted to get it tonight (there is a $100 after-hours fee, but since we have a snowstorm he'd prefer it now). He tells me that I need to Venmo him $275 (the cost of the towing) and he would cover the after-hours fee.He later texts me that I owe him 275, to which I respond that I don't agree, and after I had some conversations with my roommates, they suggested maybe splitting the cost with him (me paying $150). I texted him that  I would pay 150 if he wanted, and he responded with things like \"Don't speak to me till you send my money,\" \"Pay me my money to don't fucking talk to me,\" and \"That 150 can count towards the 275 you owed me.\" I told him to sleep it over and think about me offering $150 and he told me that he decided to unadd him on everything and not to contact him till I \"paid him his money.\"(For added context, although this might not be fair to him, he dropped me off at my place yesterday and I mentioned that I saw someone getting towed here and made a joke to which he responded.)I understand that I might be partly liable and should have checked again when he showed up, but if he's going to keep being an asshole about it am I in my right to refuse to pay him anything? My patience is already pretty thin.Thanks!",

	"body" : "I (25F) knew my ex-best friend (26F) since we were in the fourth grade together. We absolutely were best friends, basically sisters, but it has been 3 years since ending our friendship on difficult terms. I realized that she relied heavily on me for everything, and I would bend over backwards with whatever she wanted or needed. This not mutual as when I went through my own significantly difficult time in my life, she was not there for me and instead was condescending and treated me like it didn’t matter that I was going through difficulties, and that I just had to “get over it”. I was not in a place in my life to bend over backwards for her anymore and she did not attempt to even be there for me, let alone help me when I needed her most. At this time I just stopped talking with her and we drifted apart with hurt feelings but no real blowup.She reached out about a year after we had drifted apart, and I agreed to attempt to reconnect, only to realize again how selfish she was when a crisis came up while we were re-connecting, and she blew me off after I asked for a simple request from her. At this time, I then also told her I would love to remain her friend, but I could not be best friends with her anymore. She blew up at this and said if I wouldn’t be best friends, she didn’t want me in her life at all, so we stopped being friends. I also found out from another friend that she was saying untrue and mean things about me, such as calling me manipulative and saying I could not keep secrets, so my friend should “watch out for me”. So I know she was talking badly behind my back and telling lies, as well as twisting the story to make her out to be the victim.Fast forward three years, I am getting married! My mom (68F) has been going through a hard time, so she has been acting out and causing problems toward me. She got it in her head that she had to reconnect with my ex-best friend. The problem began when I started discussing the invitations to the wedding and my mom announced that as a matter of fact that, “ex-best friend is coming to the wedding” and in fact that she had already invited her. I told my mom absolutely not, and that she couldn’t give unofficial invites because I still had not finalized my guest list, which my mom did not take well. My mom said that I “actually want [my ex-best friend] there, [I] just don’t know it”. My mom also claimed because she is helping pay for the wedding, it’s actually my mom’s wedding and I need to just accept it. I am in charge of sending invitations and I am refusing to make one out for my ex-best friend, no matter what my mom says. My mom demands I just “need to forgive and forget”, but I do not want to have another attempt at being friends with her and I really do not want to invite her to my wedding.So, AITA for not allowing my mom to invite my ex-best friend to my wedding?",

She has never watched my daughter for even a few hours on her own. She has always been flaky and will make big promises and not follow through, or cancel last minute. She loves her carefree life without kids, she doesn't pay for her house or her car, doesn't have medical aid, she spends most of her income on personal care, grooming, shopping, etc. She gets really angry when I cancel plans with her, and I have had to cancel plans in the past, but only because my daughter got sick which often happens because she's in school.Last weekend, we spent the day with family and my daughter played with her cousins. My sister spent most of the day smoking and drinking with the adults, and never looked after the children. When it came time to go home, my daughter didn't want the party to end and my sister made all sorts of promises to her, saying that she could go home with her and stay with her for the night, etc. She didn't talk to me about this before, so I originally took it as empty promises to keep a preschooler from crying.But when I confronted my sister and told her that she can't just promise my daughter things and make arrangements for her without checking with me first, she became very angry, disrespectful and belligerent with me. I had to tell her that she has no right to make decisions for my daughter without checking with me first, and she didn't agree with me, until I said that they could of course do a sleepover, we just had to make the proper arrangements. You can't just change the plans willy nilly, or make promises to a child that you don't intend on keeping.I feel deeply disrespected by my sister and feel like she is undermining my authority with my daughter. My husband and I are going through a divorce, and my sister is really judgmental and not supportive at all. Her response to my initial announcement was to change the subject to her relationship status with her on-off long-term boyfriend. I am afraid that if she spends time with my daughter, she will talk badly behind my back or do things that I wouldn't be okay with. She also smokes and I don't want my daughter around that.My sister just texted me to ask if my daughter, who has never spent a night away from me, can spend the weekend with her. So AITA for not wanting that to happen right now? And should I explain myself or just make an excuse and say why now isn't a good time? My sister can be very combative and I don't feel up to fighting her as well, I'm already dealing with a lot and trying to hold my head above water.",

I visited his flat that he shares with his girlfriend Amy. The problems started when I was helping his girlfriend cook dinner. I tried to make some small talk, but she wasn't really interested. I assumed she was just an introvert and left it at that. Whilst we were eating dinner me and mack were are talking about how shadow and bone were cancelled, I asked his girlfriend if she had ever seen it. She said that it seemed like a dumb show. This shocked me a little, and I think my friend was shocked to I change the subject, but every time I tried to include Amy, she would always give one word answers or be rude. The same happened when Mack tried to include her, too.Eventually, I left and went back to my hotel. The next day, I woke up to a Facebook text from Amy saying that I was a bich and was trying to steal her man. I was very confused and asked her if I said something to imply that. She responded by saying that the way I was acting was very flirty to her boyfriend, and I was being dismissive of her. I reminded her of what she said during the dinner and how she was dismissive to me and Mack, but she just started insulting me.I blocked her, but later on in the day, one of her friends was messaging me saying the same thing. I was really confused about why she was going through the trouble of doing all of this. I ended up taking screenshots of everything and sending it to my friend. He apologised and said that he would talk to her.Later on, I got a message saying that I was a jerk and that they were now in a massive fight over it. I looked at the profile, and it was another one of her friends. I blocked her and then set my account to private. After thinking about it for a while, I brought it up to one of my other friends (Cara), and she said I should have just ignored them from the start instead of telling Mack about it.I feel bad because I know Mac really likes this girl, and I don't want to be the reason that they argue. But at the same time, I don't want to be harassed when I feel like I did nothing wrong. But also, maybe I did, and I just don't realize it.Update 1:So I spoke to Cara again to see what was happening with Mack and Amy, and she told me something surprising. I didn't mention this before, but Cara is also friends with Mack and some other people who I know. It turns out last month they were all hanging out a bar, and I happened to come up in conversation. Mack was apparently really drunk and said that I was his first crush back in primary school for over a year. This made his girlfriend upset because I was going to fit it soon. It turned into a big argument in front of everyone and him promising that we were just friends.I was really surpriand felt a bit bad for Amy so I called up Mack to see if it was true. He was really mad that someone told me so I think that it was true. He kept on asking, who told me and refused to answer any of my questions. I told him I wasn't going to tell him who told me what happened because I didn't want him to blame them. We got into an argument about it, so I just handed up on him.I don't know what to do now. Part of me wants to apologize to Amy, but at the same time, I feel like I don't have anything to apologise for. I really don't know what to do, so if any of you have any advice, please put a comment.",

I asked to stay at his place for a bit since Im not supposed to be driving and wanted observation. He was ok with it. We had a tiff that evening when I said I had a headache & he told me that’s not possible since I don’t have nerves in my brain & that my stroke was so small I’m probably imagining it. I explained it is possible and very common, and asked him to not minimize my experience. He started to raise his voice in defense and I calmly said that I will not deal with being yelled at right after a stroke. He apologized & said he was trying to make me feel better & then left.When he got home he was visibly annoyed. I told him I wasn’t mad and asked what’s wrong, he broke down and said he was stressed about his work. I told him it was ok to take a break to eat and take a nap, to tell his work that I had a stroke & it would be ok, that there was no need to stress so badly. I said I’d have my mom fly out and stay with me to give him space so he can work.He woke me up in the morning with all kinds of food (not sure if I thanked him since I was so out of it but I was clearly happy and praised his choices) then tried to stay out of his way and do some puzzles (to help my brain) while he worked. Later, I asked him to take me to pick up my meds. Again, he was annoyed and asked why I picked a CVS that was 6 mins away instead of a closer one, and if it would be a regular thing. I assured him it was a one time pickup and thanked him for taking me. Once home he was still visibly annoyed so again, I asked what’s wrong.

I need to be focused on my cognitive therapy to make sure I have the best recovery possible. I told him I’d be getting an Uber home and I hope he got his work done.

I also think I am justified in asking considering they don't pay for anything else (such as groceries, utilities or gas).

However, lately, I've been feeling uncomfortable attending because of my sister-in-law (30F).The issue lies in her constant comments about what I'm wearing. I consider myself to have a unique style, and while I understand that everyone is entitled to their opinions, her remarks have been consistently negative. It's not just a passing comment; she often makes snide remarks or gives disapproving looks that make me feel self-conscious.Last Sunday was the breaking point for me. I put effort into choosing an outfit I felt confident in, but as soon as I arrived, my sister-in-law didn't hold back. She made comments about how my outfit was \"too bold\" and questioned my fashion choices in front of everyone. I tried to brush it off, but it ruined my mood for the entire gathering.This week, I decided to skip Sunday lunch to avoid the negativity. I explained to my family that I needed a break and some space. Now, my sister-in-law is upset, saying I'm overreacting and being overly sensitive. My parents are trying to mediate, but I can't help but wonder if I'm in the wrong here.",

	"body" : "I work at a convenience store and this lady came in a couple of times wanting to buy vape refill cartridges. The deal posted was originally $5 off each pack if you buy two, and it lasted for a couple months. Then, the next month rolls around, and the lady comes in to buy her four packs, so it should come up as $10 total off; but the deal changed. The system now takes off only $4 off per pack, so $8 off total. She says something is not right, so I contact my manager, and we find out the $5 off sign is still up. The manager corrects the system, and they fix it.A week or so later, she comes back in, and buys the same four packs, and the system still has the deal as $4 off.  She states there is still something wrong, and I get my manager again. We go through the process, she leaves, then my manager and I look at the sign. It's been changed, but the layout of the shelves and prices is a bit off. Everything is misaligned on one side, so I can see how she is confused. The price for the product next to the ones she wanted to buy overlaps with the ones she wanted, as there are many flavor options. The real price of the items she wanted, however, is clearly marked as being for those types of refills. It's obvious, but we both shrug it off and it's whatever.She comes back in today, and complains of the same issue. Today I told her that the deal has been changed, and I show her the prices and which items they are for, hopefully clearing any confusion. Then she argues a bit with me, to which I apologize. I understand that people get confused, but she has done this before, and I just wanted to make it clear to her that the deal had been changed. She tells me it's not my fault, but my manager's. I told her, however, it is the tobacco-stocking-people's fault since the company I work for outsources it. It is not stocked, priced, shelved, or even counted by the store's management. She then continues and says that the law says it's illegal to be falsely advertising it.AITA for not giving her the deal? Sorry for the formatting, it's my first post here.",

There’s no one on this earth that I’d rather be married to. But she has a tendency to communicate in a  passive aggressive manner and we’ve had multiple conversations about it and she says she will try to be better. However, it continues on and on.For example… this morning I woke up, took the baby and played for an hour to let her sleep in, and then she came downstairs like usual. Then I went to clean something in the kitchen and left to go into the other room and she said “no coffee for me huh?”. (When I make coffee I always make us both coffees but I hadn’t made mine yet..) I explained that to her and a few minutes later made both coffees. Then I was tidying in the other room and she had the baby for maybe 5 minutes and I heard him fussing and she said loudly “oh I guess I’m the only one that takes care of you huh” to the baby. ??? I went over and grabbed him immediately but I told her “hey, you can just ask me to get the baby. I don’t need the passive aggressive stuff”. She was very displeased by this and said I’m being so evil and negative. Also said some other not nice things.Am I being gaslit here or AITA? If you need more info I’m happy to provide. But now I feel I can’t even tell her when she’s doing something wrong, I just have to take it.",

	"body" : "I'm currently in my first year of university (US), and the school I go to is both very prestigious and diverse - especially in regard to the Asian and international student population. One of the people I met in the first week of school is an international East Asian girl - this will be important later - we can call Amy. We get along really well and are in the same friend group, but ever since the start of the year, Amy has made various comments that have made me extremely uncomfortable, and, quite frankly, seem racist.The first instance came on a hot, sunny day early in the school year when my friend group went to a local park. All was well as we walked there, but half-way there Amy asked the entire group if anyone had an umbrella, to which we all said no. When I asked her why, she said that she \"didn't want to get any darker\" than she already had gotten. For reference, Amy was about as pale as it gets when this happened. The rest of my friends - white or asian and all from the US - seemed shocked and uncomfortable, but I chalked it up to just being wary of sunburn because I didn't know her well yet.Just a few weeks after that, though, Amy and I were watching videos of K POP stars when she exclaimed how great their skin looks. I told her that when you have a makeup artist as professional as they do, anyone can look amazing, but, without breaking eye contact with the phone, she told me she was talking about how white their skin looked. This time I could feel a rising anger in me, so I asked her why it mattered, to which she said \"in my culture it's the beauty standard\".If you were wondering, I am black and have had to brush off all levels of racism because I am from an all white city. Part of me had hoped that by going to a university of my school's caliber and diversity, I might not have to deal with it as much, but is seems I was naive, and have heard various other comments from her regarding this same topic. I genuinely can't tell if she is oblivious to the fact she is saying white skin is the \"beauty standard\" to a black person or if she knows and doesn't care. The next time she makes a similar comment, I really want to tell her she's being offensive and that her culture's standards don't justify whatever she says. WIBTA in this situation?Edit: After some very helpful comments - thank you so much - I have definitely pivoted my stance of her comments being racist. My main qualm now lies more in the inconsideration her deeming what is beautiful directly to someone that is most definitely not that, and furthermore can’t change that aspect of them.",

I don't get payed enough to work harder.The bonus isn't even that much and to be fair I didn't care since I wasn't working full year and had no way of getting it anyways.In my opinion my colleague could have requested to swap shifts with someone else and I would fully understand.

Also my coworker is in the factory for 25 years now and earns better then me. I get 13€/hour he gets 17. If I'd get the same amount I'd be willing to work more effiecient.",

She spent a lot of time with her great grandma as a child and they grew apart for a while but became close again when my daughter reached adulthood, its a beautiful relationship.My daughter hasn't been able to visit for a while because shes away for school, so last week while I visited my grandma I mentioned to her that my daughter changed her name. When she realised it was about her name she just lit up and seemed so happy! It was a great moment, especially as there have been points where she cant even remember my daughters existence - not to mention shes always been a very serious and less-emotional person, so these moments feel extra precious. I know my daughter spent a long while planning how she would incorporate grandma's name into her own and so I was really happy to see that my grandma liked it and felt honoured by it. I thought my daughter would be thrilled to find that out. Recently she has been declining a lot and we're all worried about her and trying to arrange a visit, including my daughter, but I just wanted to make sure someone told grandma about the name change before things got bad and she forgot.Later, I told my daughter about this but she got quiet and upset without telling me why. I only told my grandma about the name change because my daughter has been out of state for a few months and didn't have enough money to come back and visit but my daughter seems really upset over this. AITA?EDIT to clarify: In a text she told me I 'crossed a line' but wont say anything more when I ask.

Asked him to clean the TV unit - he took a bottle of liquid dishsoap and a dry cloth and ‘cleaned’ the raw wood.  He’s a 42 year old educated man.  He knows how to do this shit.  So now I don’t bother asking because it will end in an argument.Anyway, I went to fold the four baskets of laundry on the kitchen table.  Jim gets up to plug in his phone and sits at the table.  He watches me fold clothes.  I pushed the basket of towels towards him and asked him to fold them.Jim got a bitchy attitude and said “Oh, are you happy you get me to do something? I could see from your face that you were annoyed I wasn’t doing anything.” He was ANGRY at me for being annoyed he didn’t do anything.I asked him that if he could see I was annoyed, why didn’t he help out or talk to me.  He just repeated “oh, you’re so happy you’re getting me to do something.”Jim then folded the eight towels and went back to the couch with his phone.He left the folded towels on the table. AITHA for making Jim fold towels and therefore making him mad?I don’t know what the solution would be - for me NOT to be annoyed that he does nothing and I do everything?And because I know what some responses will bewe both work full time.I have the more physically demanding job.

There’s a lot of history with these people, but in the interest of brevity, let’s just say that our relationship is superficial. We really aren’t capable of heart-to-hearts and have issues with communication.So here’s the thing: We live in the mountains of Colorado where wildlife is a daily part of our life. I’m talking deer, elk, bear, fox, mountain lion, etc. It’s my favorite thing about being here. But the deer are just different than they are in other parts of the country (at least from what I’ve observed). They are very comfortable with people and can easily be “trained” if locals aren’t careful.The grandmother has taken to feeding the deer, to the point that they literally line up at her front door, waiting for a treat. This is a problem for several reasons:The deer are becoming aggressive. My husband tried to get out of his car with groceries and they surrounded him. Thankfully they didn’t escalate but it was eerily disconcerting.The more she feeds them, the more show up. We have literal herds of deer in our backyard. They poop everywhere, and I’ve actually started picking up the deer poop to keep our dogs from eating it. Deer poop carries all kinds of disease- you don’t want it all over your backyard.It’s illegal and highly frowned upon in our community. To save some space on this post, check out this website if you want to know more:https://cpw.state.co.us/learn/Pages/do-not-feed-wildlife.aspx#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20%22human%20food%22,in%20Colorado%2C%20even%20through%20winter.We’ve talked to her about it directly. We asked her daughter (my husband’s mom) to talk to her about it. She always says she’ll stop, and then a few weeks later, I see her throwing apples out of the front door again. I’ve tried printing out literature explaining why it’s a bad idea to feed the deer but she won’t listen.I’ve got just one potential course of action left: To report her to Parks & Wildlife. They’ll come to the cottage, educate her, and charge her a $100 fine. If she won’t listen to me, maybe she’ll listen to the authorities (especially if money is involved).But a little part of me says that it’s a real AH move to report an elderly lady to the authorities who just can’t help but feed cute wilderness animals….WIBTA?",

My uncle would often said that we should be taking care of them since we are living in their house rent free. I am obligue to give, but not my sister.I a paying our  utility bills and groceries. When my sis asked to live with us, she told us they will be sharing with the utilities and will be cooking separately (using my gas stove). But none of this happen. They never shared anything and their children often asked for food from us since their parents dont leave them money for food.  No one is contributing. They are reluctant to share since they knew i am earning several folds their salary.Every day my sis and my uncle have daily deliveries. This bothers me, they said they do not have money to share in the household expences and yet, their online purchases are coming nonstop. i even sometimes paid for these purchases as the package came “unexpectedly early” and they do not have the money to pay for it yet. they never pay me back.

I think 70% was fair since the remaining 30% will be divided to 3 families. Came June bill, I asked my mom for their share, she told me to pay for it first and and they will pay me later.

Dad left us 16 years ago, and Patricia was the second adult providing for the family.When I was born I was suffocated or something, and was labeled as developmentally disabled. No one in the family ever looked past that label. Felicia and Arianna always treated me like a joke and excluded me from everything.Whenever I was alone with either Felicia or Arianna, she'd basically bully me. Past 2009, whenever I told Mom what those two did to me, she would do the same thing to me.Mom only saw me as disabled and incapable of anything, and wouldn't even bother to raise me. I never had a chance to grow.My school closed down and Mom put me in an ABA institution afterwards. The staff there made me completely regress, but Mom assumed the disorder was why. I suffered a mental health crisis when I was 10, which got me in a hospital. Mom only blames the disorder, so the staff who abused me were allowed to continue. Mom also grounded me for making her miss a day of work because of my \"little attitude\".The big rule at the institution was to  Just Follow Directions™. If no one told me to do a thing, I should never do it until I'm told. If someone makes me uncomfortable, I still needed to just follow their directions. At home, I stopped asking Mom for basic necessities like soap and underwear. I quit showering and doing laundry as that was being a good kid, being out of the way. I eventually smelled horrible, which was blamed on the disorder. Also, when I finally had the courage to ask for new necessities again, Felicia and Arianna would find it so funny that some R Word scum would want something so mature that even they would use. Mom and Patricia found it funny as well, asking why I suddenly want to be so \"fancy\". I finally got back on track with hygiene when I was allowed to shop alone, as I was able to buy anything without judgment, and hide it after I bought it.From late 2018 to mid 2020, Mom treated me much worse than the usual. Much much worse. To this day it's really hard to talk about.In 2021, Mom crossed yet another line, one that I also refuse to write about. I was so offended by how the family treated me that I impulsively changed my whole name without publishing, but a slip-up revealed my name to Felicia and Arianna. They of course found it funny and were belittling towards me. They've treated me this way about my name basically forever.Now, Patricia has terminal cancer and is dying. If a new house is bought, it will be in Felicia's name. Felicia is extremely petty and will force me to comply with her as she owns the house. That's just how she is.

He has a good voice, but he is very self conscious about it. Apparently, in high school he was singing during youth group one day and a girl leaned over to him and said, \"If you aren't going to try to sing then don't sing at all.\" He says since then he doesn't like letting most people hear him sing as he feels he doesn't have a good voice.I've tried convincing him to come with us for months now and that his singing voice is good and that what that girl said was cruel but he has to try to move on. I promised he didn't have to sing and he could instead just watch and enjoy our company. Saturday he agreed to come.We were all taking turns and singing and having fun. Friends would ask him what he was going to sing and he kept saying that \"Karaoke isn't his thing.\" As the night went on and drinks were flowing I guess people kept asking him to try and he was starting to consider it. He gave me a look like he wanted my opinion on it and I said, \"I won't make you sing but it may good for you to try.\" The whole group agreed so he went and selected his song.I don't know if it was the nerves, song, or the alcohol but he admittedly wasn't very good. Was off key even for Karaoke and he wasn't great with the timing. He's usually better. However, when it ended I still gave him a big cheer and my friends cheered too. The rest of the place was pretty silent minus a few claps here and there. He sits down and is friendly with everyone for a minute then he tells me he wants to go home. I asked if we could stay just a bit longer. He said that I could and went and ordered an Uber for himself. He left telling everyone he was feeling tired.When I got home he went ballistic on me saying that I pressured him to sing and that it was extremely embarrassing for him seeing my friends pity clap him and the rest of the place just silent and awkward. I don't believe I pressured him but he said that not shutting down my friends requesting him to sing was endorsing it, which I understand but feel my friends weren't that insistent and that he was good. We cheered him afterwards and we gave a bunch of compliments. I can't control how he is feeling about others and while they maybe shouldn't have kept asking, he is fully capable of refusing their requests. He slept on the couch that night and the past few days hasn't wanted to hang out or really talk.I feel he's overreacting and making a bigger deal than it needs to be. My friends agree that he shouldn't be acting like this. They feel if he is this self conscious about this then he should take singing lessons instead of taking his insecurities out on me who was only trying to help and share a hobby of mine.

While we were there, my dad decided to take us to one of these spa-pool-relaxation places that are typically near ski-hotels (sorry if I'm not explaining this correctly).We get to this spa and we check in, and after 3 or so hours we decide to leave. We get to the check out reception and my dad is paying. My brother, my dad and I are being charged as adults (anyone over 12 is), but my dad is under the assumption that I will get a student discount.In Germany there is a \"Student\" discount— but my dad thought it meant like anyone who's in high school, but it actually means university student. So clearly there was a language barrier somewhere. My dad starts picking a fight with the woman at the cash register.The woman at the cash register (Laura, as her name tag said), keeps explaining to my dad that in Germany student refers to University student, and \"schüler\" is high school student. My dad keeps disagreeing with her and saying that the discount doesn't explicitly state that it is only a university student discount, and keeps trying to haggle her for a discount.We're standing at the front of the cue, in front of a bunch of other families who are waiting to check out. My brother is typically very aloof and stays out of it, but I was honestly dying of embarrassment at this point and tried to jump in.I told him that Laura was right, and I explained to him (somewhat condescendingly) that Laura was right and he was wrong. My dad is very prideful, so essentially I embarrassed him in front of the woman and the other families. I told him he should just pay the full price because I'm not eligible for any discount. My dad gives me the dirtiest look. He begrudgingly pays the full price and mumbles some colorful words under his breath.After we leave the spa and head to the car, he stops me and points his finger in my face telling me:\"When we are in public, you either agree with me or you keep your mouth shut.\"He was obviously very angry with me for embarrassing him in front of everyone, and it honestly spoiled the rest of the day and vacation because he kept being short with me or huffing and puffing during dinner.My brother thinks I should've kept my mouth shut, but I think I was in the right in trying to humble my dad's attitude.AITA?",

	"body" : "Long time lurker, first time poster. I don't have many friends so I genuinely don't have anyone else to askMy (42F) best friend (Jane, 42F) got engaged on New Year's Day; this is her first engagement, and she's never been married. She and her fiancée, Joe (40something M), have been living together for about 5 years. Info-he does not like me. I didn't do anything deliberate to cause this, but I met him during the pandemic and we disagreed about masks. I've tried to let bygones be bygones, but his dislike for me remains. I'm sure there must be more to it but I genuinely don't know.I found out about the engagement in a convoluted way. We've been friends for 20+ years & both have adult children. One of Jane's daughters posted about the engagement on SnapChat, where one of my daughters saw it. My daughter sent me a text asking, \"Is Aunt Jane engaged??\" I was extremely surprised, but before I could respond, my daughter told me how she learned about it. I ran over to Facebook and there it was; Jane had posted about Joe asking her to marry him on January 1. By the time I learned about her engagement, it was January 4. She texted me on January 5, with save the date info. I responded, \"Yeah, I saw your fb post; congrats\" & she responded, \"Wow thanks\".This is where I think I'm the asshole. I was absolutely crushed that Jane didn't tell me personally, and I told her so. I told her that l'm happy for her if she is happy but that it really hurt my feelings to find out at the same time as 1000 other people. I told her that I was sorry for being selfish and making this about my hurt feelings when this is her time to shine. That was January 6; she still hasn't spoken to me.I'm devastated by all of this. I keep thinking, if I would have just had the right reaction then I wouldn't be here right now. My immediate family doesn't think I was wrong for my response, and l've asked one coworker & another casual friend who also think my response was valid; however, I think they're pretty obviously biased.I'm pretty sure this is the end of our friendship; I don't think Jane will ever speak to me again. So was I wrong for telling her about my hurt feelings instead of just being excited for her and showering her with blessings?Please go easy on me-my heart is already hurting, but be honest too.(Cross-posted on r/TwoHotTakes bc I need answers)ETA Info: A lot of you are asking about the reasons why the fiancée doesn’t like me and are (fairly) calling me out on not liking him. I met the fiancée for the first time in August 2020 and we had a disagreement over masks. Jane & I live in different states, about 4 hours apart but I also have family in the area where she lives. I rented a house for myself & my immediate family (spouse +4 kids) so that we could visit with my family as well as Jane & her family. Jane’s house is a little small, and she said it would be more comfortable for us to visit at the VRBO. We mostly stayed outside, social distancing, but we had made a big meal that was being served inside. The idea was for everyone to put on their masks to go inside & make their plates, then we would all go back outside to eat. That time and using the bathroom were the only times I asked anyone to wear a mask.I have reasons for disliking him & I’m sure he has his (valid) reasons for disliking but I don’t want this post to get derailed. BUT I’ve never been anything but open, genuine, & welcoming with him—nor has he ever been rude or even unpleasant towards me. Despite that, there has always been tension between us.Regarding our friendship—we’ve known each other since we were 17. In that time, we’ve had many disagreements, arguments, even ugly fallouts. We were best friends, both with strong personalities & loud opinions; we definitely have fought many times over the years. There have been times when I was selfish & not there for her when I should have been. I’ve not always been a good friend or even a good person, but we’ve always made up & come back together. This time feels different.",

I'm about to have a baby and want to un-invite them from the hospital and \"meeting the baby\" visits but not sure if I'm just hormonal.When our first son was born in 2018 (first grandchild), my in-laws finally drove the 1 hour to meet him when he was almost 2 months old. We were drowning, but they definitely didn't come to offer any help, just held him for a minute, asked when we were having another one (lol) and left. I don't think they even brought a gift.During the first years of his life they barely saw him. Even when we visited their city, which was pretty frequently, they couldn't be bothered to meet up or let us come over. 2 years ago they moved to our community so my husband can take care of them in their old age (something we did not agree to). They see our two kids every week now and do treat them well.At first I thought they just weren't into being grandparents. But my husband's oldest sister just had her first baby, and the in-laws flew across the US to stay with them for a month to \"help.\" (Unsure whether they are helping as they have always parentified their kids, especially with housework.) They even had to get FIL's dialysis treatments transferred over there so this was no small thing.It's possible that in the past they were just going through a rough time and didn't have space to think about their grandkids. But I've always been treated as less than in their family (most famously, was uninvited by MIL from SIL's wedding because I was pregnant and me being there would \"ruin the day for SIL\"). It's even harder for me to tolerate seeing my husband feeling unloved. It's been so sad for him to feel like they don't care as much about him or his family.I'm about to have our third and last baby and we are going to need so much more help than we ever did with the others. I'm sure the in-laws will not offer any. But would it be too petty of me to 1) not allow them to visit us in the hospital, and 2) tell them they can visit only if they're planning to do some housework and not just hold the baby? (I have not discussed this with husband yet.) I want to because I'm mad and vengeful. But hormones are raging so I'm not sure whether to trust my feelings.EDIT: Comments have shown that I was unclear: I am not asking for help because we can't handle a baby on our own, but because they offered it to SIL and have never offered it to us. My husband also feels slighted. Also, I find hosting stressful and don't really like people coming over just to hold the baby and expect me to entertain them.",

While there my SIL was acting strange towards us. She was being very short and walking away when we tried speaking to her. SIL is one of my closest and oldest friends. We talk to her on a regular basis and she was completely normal up until she arrived today. After an hour, my husband checked in to make sure she was ok. SIL proceeded to tell my husband that we should not be there, because we did not go to her childs birthday party. She lashed out at him for a minute and then we left.I sent her a text to remind her why we were not at said party. It was because a family member I was EXTREMELY close to passed away 2 days before the party. We were grieving and preparing a funeral service. Also reminded her that we did get our niece a gift and gave it to her at a later date. She then told me we \"didn't show up to the first party either\" and not to argue. We didn't go to that one because we already had a prior commitment. I told her as soon as I received the invitation, and asked if we could come over a different day. We did end up going to their house the night before the party. We brought our niece her b-day gift and had a great evening spending time with her. It's not like we are blowing off our niece. We made sure to still make her feel special and not just skip her birthday.Now I'll be honest, I was not nice in my last text to SIL. I told her we will not apologize for going to a birthday party. Why would we skip just because we couldnt make it to her childs party? And she can be hurt all she wants but this is ridiculous.I then learned that after our conversation SIL spent the remainder of the party today trash talking my husband and I to our other friends. Bringing up the fact that we don't/can't have children of our own and that must be our problem. Which has absolutely nothing to do with this situation, and quite frankly is very hurtful given our well known history of infertility and miscarriage.I am over this friendship.

We have a set time everyday to call so we avoid scheduling anything during that time as much as possible.I'm flying out on Friday for a competition in which my team and I will be representing our university. During this time, I won't be able to talk to him at all for the next several days (phone policies + being busy with the competition). Thursday at our usual time is the last time we would be able to call before I leave.This is where the problem started... After I told him how I wouldn't be able to talk to him for several days and how Thursday would be the last time, he asked to call earlier in the day on Thursday (mind you, I have classes/office hours earlier so this makes things very hard, at least to talk our usual amount of time). I was confused so I asked him why. He said that a video game was coming out during the time we usually start calling and that he'd like to play it then.I started arguing with him saying he can wait an hour and a half until I have to leave to begin playing. I didn't see why he had to start playing it the literal second it came out. He argued back saying that he'd been waiting for this game for years and that he wanted to play as much as possible before he went back to work (he goes back the day I come back. In other words, he has nothing to do all day except game while I'm gone). I explained that he can play as much as he wants while I'm gone and he'll have extra time especially because we won't be talking like usual. But he's completely refusing to budge on this. He says that he offered to call earlier that day and if that doesn't work for me then we simply won't call at all.Honestly, I was very angry. He knows how much time and energy I put into this. He knows that I am extremely nervous considering it's the first time I've ever flown out for a school competition. He knows that I've never been a captain before and that this is a really huge deal to me.I accused him of prioritizing the video game over me and he just agreed to it and didn't really see the problem. He says whenever I miss a call, that I've prioritize something else over him but I don't really see how that makes sense? If he ever told me he needed me or was not okay with me not calling, I would 100% cancel to talk to him (unless it was something I literally can't get out of).He said he was done talking about this and that his decision was final and I'd have to deal with it and then he hung up on me. I messaged him back asking what the fuck his problem was and now he's mad at me for swearing.AITA?EDIT: Not sure why I'm being spam downvoted for random replies I make.

All I know is that he is playing on his own. We had no conversation about this game beforeEDIT 3: This is not a vacation, this is a competition. We have a schedule that we have to adhere to, there are rules we have to adhere to. I didn't make these rules, I'm just forced to follow them. Not doing so can result in disqualifications. For those saying it's ridiculous that I can't spare an hour a day to call during it: I am able to call once I got back to the hotel!

Due to this, we have went our separate ways the past year, but last week I get a text asking if I would be in her wedding. I was honored that she thought of me, so I hesitantly said yes. Immediately after agreeing, Lauren let me know that I would have to contribute to some of the expenses. Assuming that meant covering my bridesmaid dress/accessories, I completely understood. However, I was put into a “bridesmaid group chat” by another bridesmaid, letting us know we are required to get our hair done (estimated $100-175 per person), required to take a trip (two hours away from home estimated at $100 per person not including food and activities), and also required to pay for decorations, let alone our outfits for the wedding itself, and who knows what else because they are not done planning! I feel like it’s a bit much, and a lot is being expected out of us. Knowing Lauren, I am anticipating to be “put in my place” if I disagree with any of these plans. AITA for finding a problem with this and wanting to decline upon learning of the extra endeavors and investments?",

	"body" : "There’s this girl, Jane (F18), who’s in a few of my (M18) classes at uni, and my friends and I sometimes hang out with her. Jane is really nice, but unfortunately, she has a lot of confidence issues when it comes to her looks. Don’t get me wrong; I think she looks fine. Most people think she’s pretty. However, for whatever reason, Jane is convinced she’s horribly ugly.Jane says a lot of self-deprecating humour about her looks, and for a good while, I thought she was just messing around. However, her friend, Kate (F18), told me that she was serious, and honestly, after paying closer attention, this became clear to me as well.So last night, I was hanging out with Jane, Kate, their other friends Maggie (F18) and Sophie (F19), and my friends Eric (M18) and Zak (M18). I don't know what was different about last night, but Jane didn’t seem too happy and was making several comments about how she looked, like she normally does.Whenever she does this in the past, Eric, Zak, and her friends will say things like “No, you’re pretty” or something similar. You get the idea. Whenever they look at me to say something, I always say something neutral, like “You look normal” or “You don’t look bad,” or I’ll shrug. Eric and Zak have told me privately in the past that I should probably say something nicer. Kate and Maggie even told me that I should, since they think I’m hard to please, and Jane would really appreciate hearing it from me because of that. I honestly don’t see the point, as whatever caused Jane to be like this can’t be solved with positive affirmation, imo.So last night, after everyone was calling her pretty and such, she kept looking over at me, and I was just like “You look tired and should probably moisturize your skin.” It was a perfectly honest observation at the time because she did look tired and her skin looked dry (its been cold the last few days so that’s probably why).Jane didn’t look happy with my response, and someone sort of changed the topic. When I was going back to my dorm with Eric, he told me that Jane was probably really upset that I didn’t say she was good-looking or something. When I told him that words weren’t really going to do anything for Jane and that she needed to change her mindset about overvaluing looks, he said that I was being a bit of a dick.AITA?Edit - I showed this post to my roommate \"Eric\" and he said I should also add in the point I had made to him in the past which was: One day I (OP) will say something nice about Jane's looks and since I've been dismissive about them so far, she'll probably fall head-over-heels for me.I forgot about saying that, but I largely said it as a joke. I don't really see what it adds though...Edit - For those wondering, she looks perfectly fine, there isn't anything wrong with how she looks. It really is just that she thinks she isn't pretty.",

He liked the idea, and I had a custom wedding gown tailored. We also agreed that it would be a black-tie event.My bride's maids are able to pick from styles and stores I have approved of; my fiance has paid for the ones already purchased as well as custom-tailored suits for his groomsmen as he wants the wedding party to have luxe brands for their outfits, which was one of his only requests.I have four bride's maids. My Future SIL, my childhood best friend, my sister and my cousin. My SIL, best friend and cousin have selected dresses from the list and they look amazing! They all look so beautiful.My sister found this dress of Shien. I'll be frank, it's ugly, it's not elegant, not formal, and not from a luxe brand. I told my sister we could go shopping for a better dress together and I showed her the list of 15 brands and about 50 styles that my fiance and I had approved.

We intended on having a small wedding with just close friends and family, however my family is very large. In total our guest count will be just under 60 people.During John’s family’s dinner we were discussing the guest list, when Martha (FMIL) brought up Jane (FSIL&MOH) and her plus one. I pulled John aside to discuss how I am uncomfortable with an open plus one for the following reasons:-Jane is not currently interested in anyone. If she did start dating someone we would have no problem inviting them, it’s just the idea of bringing someone we haven’t met just to bring someone-I am socially anxious and being around strangers in general is hard for me let alone showing PDA in front of them.-Jane will be busy all day and sitting with us at the reception. I don’t want a stranger sitting at the head table with us and our families and being in every picture, and I don’t see a point in having someone there just for them to be alone the whole time-We are trying to keep the wedding as small as possible and there won’t be a whole dance or anything she’d need a partner for-No one else is getting an open plus oneJohn agreed with me and we decided to talk to her one on one later. However, when FFIL (Henry)  brought up her plus one again I was visibly anxious, he saw something was up and kept pushing me to say something. I told him I’m not comfortable with an open plus one. He then argued with me about it in front of Jane. Jane left, obviously hurt. We talked with her later and she understood, but my in laws were still furious.Henry said I should give her a plus one because what if she meets someone she wants them to meet? Martha said I was being selfish and asked why I brought up the guest list in front of Jane if I didn’t want her to have a plus one. I tried explaining that I was not expecting that at all, and it was pried out of me. Henry said I was being too sensitive.I tried to clarify that I’m only uncomfortable with an open plus one, and if there’s someone she meets we would be happy to invite them. They were still angry when the conversation ended.Martha now wants to meet me for lunch, and idk if I can handle my own and defend my position again. I’m not sure it’s even worth the tension if it will just make me uncomfortable for one day, even if it should be just about John and me.So, AITA for not giving Jane an open plus one?",

The tour stopped at a casino close to us so we decided to go to the casino for a few days and see the show.On the way to the show I said to my gf “I’m calling it now, after the show we’re going to run into one of them at the casino.” My gf says no, and even if we did she wouldn’t say anything to them bc she doesn’t want to ruin her image of them, and she doesn’t want to meet them.After the show (which was amazing) my gf and I went to do some gambling. After a bit we separated and did our own thing, so we could play the games we wanted to.

That was it, then I walk away and call my gf to tell her how cool he was.She was definitely a bit jealous but she didn’t sound angry, then after we got off the phone I turn the corner and run into the other half of the comedy duo. Again I call my gf and tell her who I saw and ask if she wants to come down, she says no again.  This time I didn’t go up to him bc he was talking to a bunch people, but I did say great show man and he said thanks man.I go back to the room and tell my gf what happened thinking she’d be excited although a little jealous. She’s not excited at all, she’s furious with me. It’s a slap in her face, I only said hi to then to spite her, i’m selfish, I don’t even care about them so I shouldn’t have said anything to them at all.

Instead of going out.Tomorrow, I will help him working on his interviews.I was very frustrated, I really wanted to go out and enjoy 1hour of sun outside.

Every time, Cam said he’d replace them, but never did. I did. Peter peed on countless toys, indoor decor, outdoor decor, and expensive suede boots. I work hard for my kids and I to have some nice things. Peter pees on them. Cam says he’ll replace them. He doesn’t. I do. Peter goes outside often, pees on our front porch and main walkway, then marks everything he can. He’s been to the vet. No UTI. Behavioral. My other dogs don’t do this.After marriage, Cam stopped being affectionate with Peter and stopped having him groomed. After empty promises, that’s fallen on me.Now a few years later, Peter is 14. Marking daily. I don’t think it’s entirely incontinence. At night he stays shut in our room so he can’t go mark, but that makes the room too warm for Cam, so he sleeps downstairs or on the couch. Peter’s nightly habits are affecting my sleep and health, triggering chronic migraines.I begged on working toward a solution. Cam said he’d try diapers. After weeks went by, he finally got some and I said he needed bathed after having any accidents in them. He only put them on him a few days. Peter still tried marking while wearing the diaper and the diaper worked absorbing, but the kids would forget he was wearing one, being a new routine, and let him outside in it. Cam stopped putting them on him, blaming the kids.I’ve been sick. I couldn’t take Peter’s noises last night, needing sleep, so I shut him in the bathroom. Four hours later, he barked and I let him outside. He’d peed and pooped in the bathroom, tracking through it. I asked Cam to clean it and bathe him because I’m sick. He cleaned up the poop and left the pee, saying he didn’t see it. I couldn’t fall back asleep.I asked Cam if we could talk. He says I’m blaming him, but it’s Peter’s fault. I said I don’t think a dog’s behavior falls solely on the dog- he needed training years ago. He kept saying he doesn’t like getting blamed. I said it’s not about fault, but I’m frustrated with both of them and it isn’t fair he won’t replace the things he ruined. Cam said he can’t afford to replace any of it, so we just shouldn’t have those things. This seems entirely unfair to me. He earns a good salary, double what I make. He got loud, over-reactive in front of my kids and said he’ll “go take care of Peter right now,” scooping him up, giving the impression he’d put him down. I told him that’s not how those decisions are made, he needs a diaper, better sleeping arrangements, and a vet visit. Cam says I’d have to pay for it.

My in-laws own the apartment that we rent so my in-laws would be over every week doing projects on the apartment without asking us first.My husband and I hardly had alone time or date nights because of this. They decided to renovate the kitchen, which we said we didn't want because I was pregnant and I'm allergic to the dust that comes up from these projects. We were left without a kitchen and fridge for two weeks, and the apartment was covered in renovation junk so I couldn't leave my room for two weeks. They also didn't offer to bring us any food knowing that we didn't have a kitchen and that I was pregnant.Then I had the baby and my husband and I decided to move in with my parents as we needed to save money for our own home and we needed the bigger space for all the baby stuff (my parents live in a big home with many bedrooms).

She has somehow turned out an amazing human however her parents lack some emotional maturity.Without going over the many ups and downs over the course of their life, ill focus on our wedding where this started.- He said he  'didn't feel welcome' at the wedding despite us hand delivering a wedding invitation over a homemade meal. We didn't speak for 2 months over this. Finally he booked his flights to come- He decided to fly into our wedding 6pm the night before. Being too busy doing final wedding organization, we asked him to take a 30minute taxi from the airport but later we could catch up for a beer - he never replied to my calls/text for that beer- The next morning I see my wife-to-be crying before our pre-wedding breakfast because the father-in-law was complaining about not being collected from the airport. I intervened and settled the situation down, but warned him to behave at his daughters wedding.- After the wedding I expected a sign from him that we could talk about these disagreements, however after 6 months passed with no sign of him reaching out, I decide to call him and express my disappointment with his behavior.

I reached out 2 more times, each time the conversations had the same outcome- He has not tried to contact me once in year, and the few times he has contacted my wife it was a similar disagreement ending in a fight.- Hurtful comments he stated were \"you're not welcome in the family', 'its my (husbands) problem that I'm upset', 'i close the book on the relationship with you (husband)'.We are now expecting our first kid in under a month and we want our son to have a grandpa.

Now that I am about to graduate, she and the rest of her relatives are insistent that she HAS to attend, because \"she's supported me through it\". WIBTA if I simply not attend graduation party and not invite anyone?I was raised by my mother. My father was that one-visit-every-two-years type of figure, and is not a part of my life.My mother agreed to support me as I moved away. She is wealthy, so it was not a heavy burden on her budget.. I had a full scholarship for university, and she had to pay only for food and housing. We never had a good relationship, and when I moved away it became harder and harder for her to abuse me (physically and psychologically). So, of course, she started holding financial support over my head as a weapon, as well as character assassination.I was a good, hardworking kid, and had good grades. But my family to this day believes I am a drug addict, a party girl and a financial burden on \"my poor parents\". My attempts at correcting this never went well, so I stopped trying, and let people believe whatever they want to believe.Throughout the years mother would call me, threaten to cut me off (leaving me unable to buy food and pay for rent), unless XYZ conditions were met (like calling her every day, or making social media posts glorifying her, or losing weight, or installing a tracking app on my phone so she would know my location at all times). She would also call me during my classes, bombarding me with 10 to 30 calls, and when I would step out of class to pick up, she would accuse me of being out somewhere doing drugs, and say that she \"KNEW\" I had dropped out (which I had not).These insane interactions always left me feeling hopeless, and trapped. So I started working to support myself, doing whatever I could. At some point I was pulling 50 hour shifts at odd jobs just to make ends meet, so at age 23 I was burned out, had awful grades, lost my scholarship and decided to drop out until I could sort out my finances. My mother would send money every once in a while, but I no longer relied on her to pay my bills and heavily denied any offers of help from her.Now, at 27 I am finally graduating and getting my bachelors. I managed to go back, and to build my grades back up through my own means. Now she's hearing of it, she wants to attend graduation, and \"be a part of what she's helped me build\". I don't want her there. She will try and make it all about her, and meet my teachers, and meet my friends... And I just do not want to have a special moment in my life ruined by her antics.Family members have been messaging me calling me selfish. They say graduation is about family, and I am being a bad person for not allowing my family to be there \"for me\".",

For the past two years we've been going to his mom's house if we don't leave town for the holidays since my parents and his father both live far away. Every time we go to his mom's house she and his two siblings mostly spend time in their own rooms as a way to avoid and ignore the terrible conditions of the house. I spend my time sitting in a dark room on a dirty couch alone because no one at the house seems interested in spending time together. I've made dishes to contribute and twice now the food I prepare is ignored and brought home with us. I've tried helping with the cleaning up just to hear that his mom is in her room calling me crazy for trying to clean anything at all. The\"Christmas dinner\" we go over for is usually half a bowl of soup I eat in the hallway alone by the front door because everyone eats in their bedroom and the young children get the spots at the kitchen table. I grew up with Christmas gatherings being special. Seeing how my boyfriend's family goes about it was a bit of a shock to my system. There's zero preparation, zero execution, and as a guest I'm largely ignored. I'm considering telling my boyfriend I'm not interested in going to her house anymore if my Christmas day is spent like that year after year. I understand it's his mother and it's important we all get along. And despite my personal standards in cleanliness I'm not so stuck up to refuse to go into someone's home just because it's a little dirty. I get that money can be different for everybody and not every home can provide an articulate meal for special occasions. I feel uncomfortable there though like I'm in the way and unwanted. I'm neither welcomed nor bid farewell without initiating it myself. It's like it's not even a holiday, but rather we randomly showed up in the middle of the week and demanded hospitality that they aren't willing to give. At what point am I sacrificing too much of my wants and needs to make my boyfriend happy? Would it be completely out of line to bring up that I'd prefer to stay home for holidays if the environment at his mother's house doesn't change?",

	"body" : "Brief background on the housemates (using fake names), Jack (24m) and Carrie (22f) are a couple who I live with in this house. I (21f) met them through a friend (26f) who I lived with last year and this year until she moved back home permanently.Some background on their behaviour towards me, they have been very cold towards me, avoiding me, excluding me, and making fun of my behaviour behind my back to others (this behaviour was mainly just me self-isolating due to my struggle with my mental health and going through therapy again which was bringing up a lot of traumas I hadn't delt with enough). They have been comfortable \"borrowing\" my things and had been polite so I thought I was overthinking until someone made me aware of this. I brought up a conversation with all of them asking if I had done anything wrong, but they had no issues to bring up and made up excuses/ lies for their behaviour, which I didn't call out to avoid conflict.Without going into more detail about their behaviour towards me I'll just get to the beginning of what happened, While I was back home Carrie messaged me to ask when I was thinking of returning home to which I told her \"around the 2nd\". I ended up travelling back up on the 1st and when I had arrived back they saw me and panicked, Jack going up into my room to take their pet guinea pigs out of my room, leaving a lot of hay over my floor.I cleaned up the hay they had left on the floor and opened the window for the smell (the smell lingered for a week or two). I didn't immediately ask why they did that as I had a 4 hour drive up on little sleep and slightly hungover so I really just wanted to relax before going to bed.The next day there was a leak in the extension of the living room roof which I cleaned up and then went upstairs to take pictures of the roof from my room to send to the landlord. Jack and Carrie found the leak and immediately started blaming me to which I went downstairs to inform them I found that leak 2 minutes ago and that if they just looked in the pitcher they surely could tell how little water was in it.Now this is where maybe I'm an A-hole because it was poorly timed, I said \"I've been meaning to ask you, why you didn't ask to put the guinea pigs in my room?\" to which Carrie immediately said that now was not the time but I ignored her and continued on saying that if she had just asked I would've been fine with it. To which Jack responded with something like they took \"liberties\" which I snapped back at how disrespectful they have been towards me and that I've tried to communicate with them but they lack the ability to do the same. This angered both Carrie who made a dig at me for poor communication on the 2 minutes of me not telling them of the leak I cleaned up, and Jack as he was visibly frustrated and started yelling at me, \"I don't know you, I don't like you\" and referring to this question and the conversation I previously mentioned as me having \"another episode\".",

It's been mostly civil, we're still good friends and decent co-parents.When we got married, I gave him my Grandfather's ring, and he gave me his Grandmother's. When we split, I asked for the ring back right away as I adored my Pop and it has incredible sentimental value to me. I tried to return his Grandmother's ring at the time, and he refused, saying he didn't want it back in hopes we'd rekindle. I would offer it again whenever I remembered it, and R insisted he didn't want it back. Early on, I even left it on his desk, only for him to put it back on mine.Now, I have ADHD and my organization skills and memory are both not fantastic. When I first took the ring off, I kept it on my very cluttered desk, and would promptly forget it existed. When I saw it and remembered it was there, I'd offer it to R who would reject it. Just after New Year I saw it again, was turned down again, and decided I really need to put this somewhere properly before I lose it. So I put it in a little box with my engagement ring, and put it somewhere for safe keeping.I'll also note that while I've said rekindling the relationship isn't totally off the table, it's not something I'm banking on and neither should he.Yesterday, after a comment was made about me wanting to hold onto my Pop's ring even if we got back together, he got angry and demanded his Grandmother's ring back. I told him I'd put it away somewhere safe, but couldn't remember exactly where as it wasn't where I thought it was. He told me to find it immediately.I told him that isn't reasonable, as I don't have time immediately for a thorough search, and he called me TA for losing it. I told him I'd put it away so that it didn't properly go missing, and that I would find it as soon as I could but it wasn't my top priority above kids and work, and that he had plenty of chances to keep it safe and know exactly where it was every time I offered. He told me I had to return it by end of today (which I've been working for most of) and I got some nasty messages this morning.

When she did this, she was in decent health and of sound mind.  Signing it over was her idea, not mine.For context,  there's me 48/f then I have 2 brothers 53/m (we'll call him Kyle) and 52/m (we'll call him Dex).  Our dad died years ago and after he died I'm who helped and took care of our mom.   I stayed living with her to help her financially and then with medical issues she had over the years.   I never lived there for free and wasn't a freeloader  I helped her with the mortgage, taxes, upkeep/maintenance.  Plus all the other typical expenses of a home.  I could afford my own house but I couldn't help her and do that too.   I gave up a lot so my mom didn't lose her home and I don't regret it.  Getting married wasn't a priority to me but my living situation was often a deal breaker to men and I also gave up having/adopting kids to help her.  If I had kids I was planning to be a single parent from the start by way of adoption or IVF.Houses age and things need replaced/repaired before my mom died I was already making improvements because well ... it needed to be done.  Since she has died...  I renovated a lot.   I updated the electrical system, the kitchen, 2 bathrooms, put in all knew light fixtures, new doors throughout the house.  Then I redid a lot of the yard too.  All of which I paid for myself.  Essentially, I made it my own home and the way I wanted it.  Some of these things were changes my mom wanted that we had planned to do together.\"Dex\" had no issues with our mom giving me the house.   The house wasn't exactly free, when she died she still had a small mortgage left and I assumed that debt plus well, the house needed a lot of work.   Kyle threw a fit though.   Both of them had their own homes.  Kyle would always talk down about the house because it wasn't in great shape, my mom couldn't afford the repairs and couldn't do them herself.  I did what I could over the years when she was still alive.  He only became interested in house when he found out it was worth more than he thought and he didn't want the house, he wanted the money.  He tried to sue me in court to buy out his \"interest\" in the house but his case was dismissed because the house wasn't an asset of our mom's  when she died.I have since sold this house.  It was valued at $75,000 when she died.   It sold for $235,000 recently so I gave my brother each a third of what the value was ... when she died.  I gave them both a check for $25,000.  Most of the rest I used as a down payment on the house I bought.  Dex was happy with that $25,000.  Kyle is throwing a fit that he says I owe both of them $78,000 each for it to be fair/equal.

Being part of a large family I had 9 siblings involved in the wedding. Her two sisters as the remaining bridesmaids.  I planned her bachelorette party and paid over 2k for it. We went on the trip and I paid for anything she wanted. Once we were back E began ignoring me. I confronted E on three different occasions asking what I had done to upset her and to apologize.  E said if I didn’t know what I had done to upset her then I wasn’t sorry for it and wouldn’t accept my apology. I approached E’s sister and asked her what I had done to upset E.  Her sister said she didn’t know what it was and that she was probably stressed. The treatment continued and I finally told E that I wanted to withdrawal from the wedding and work on our friendship and that if she was willing I wanted to be a bridesmaid but until then I didn’t feel right being a bridesmaid with the current issues. E agreed and told me she would work on our relationship. After that conversation things were better. After that my sister and I were getting our bridesmaid dresses altered. They needed major alterations and extra material was needed. I told E to order an extra bridesmaid dress and that I would pay for it so we could use it as material. E said the dresses were discontinued and that we would use the hem scraps to alter them. My dress was being altered at a shop and my sisters by a family friend. My sister ended up needing a lot of material for her alterations and didn’t have any scraps. I asked E if she could get scraps from the alteration shop for us to use. My brother picked up my dress and was supposed to get the scrap material. He came home and my dress had been unaltered and no scraps had been brought home for my sister. When asked why my dress was unaltered he said there were no leftover hem scraps and that E said to cut up my dress to use the material for my sister and to use the remaining material for a new bridesmaid. I asked E why I was no longer in the wedding since we had an agreement that I would be since our relationship was better. E said she didn’t think I wanted to be in the wedding and told the shop to not alter my dress. My dad told E that if I wasn’t in the wedding our family wouldn’t attend. Once E realized we were serious she asked me to be in the wedding. We scrambled to get my dress altered and to find material for my sisters dress.

My ex-spouse took care of him for a while, then my ex-SIL and her wife - who I was on good terms with - took him in. I still couldn't take him because the place I live didn't allow pets. Ex-SIL and wife adore cats and I knew that Dash would be taken care of.I am grateful that ex-SIL and wife made Dash's final years comfortable. I would be sent photos and general updates about how he was going. I visited when I could, which wasn't as often as I liked because they live very far away. Dash was deeply loved and cared for. He brought joy to all of our lives.I had been hosting D&D games for years, before and after I left my ex. Our last session was this past November. By the end, it was clear that wife was upset. I thought it had been something I had done that upset her. The game ended early and we took a break for the rest of the year. I gave them space I thought they needed.In the new year, ex-SIL and wife contact me again to schedule our next session for tonight. I was worried, but I agreed. I saw wanted to make up for last time.I was talking to my kids (7m and 9m) earlier this week. Out of nowhere, they tell me that Dash is dead. I kept a straight face for their sake and tried to move on. When I asked my ex how the kids were handling it, I got more information than expected. They had seen Dash over Christmas. His kidneys were failing. Dash passed away two weeks ago.Dash was old, and the fact he has passed and how isn't what upsets me. I had no idea how sick he had been recently. Ex-SIL and wife didn't tell me anything. Dash's passing isn't their fault and this is probably a very difficult time for them. It's that I didn't get to say goodbye to Dash, and the news had to come from my kids.I was devastated and furious. They had so much time to tell me what was happening. I still don't understand why they couldn't just say that he didn't have much time left and that I should come to see him. Now Dash is dead and will never get the chance to thank him for being there all those years.I decided that if they were going to deny me the courtesy of telling me and being there in his final moments, I had no reason to DM for them. I deleted our discord server and my notes, and went silent.Tonight, I get a message from ex-SIL asking about the session. I briefly respond, explaining that I know about Dash, that I am having a lot of mixed feelings, and that I'm not ready now. This is followed by a message from wife. Apparently, she was planning on telling me tonight. I can't help but wonder if she was going to tell me before or after the session.Ex-SIL and wife are understandably upset. They cared very deeply for Dash. Still, I'm very hurt. If they had only told me sooner, I could have had one more chance to see him again. I cannot talk to them right now, and that means not DMing for them for a long time.",

If you know anything about Philadelphia and Kensington, she was on the streets of Kensington for 20 years or more and had nothing to do with us during her struggles. We tried to get her off the streets and help her. But if you know a herion addict you know our struggles. So after 18 years on the streets and several stays in prison she finally got herself on treatment meds. We welcomed her back in to our lives because she is family and we would do anything for her, as long as she is clean. So about 6 months in to having her back in our lives our daughter decided to have a relationship with her. But now she is telling my daughter that \"we are not her parents\" and does not have to listen to us (she lives very peacefully in our home) but since we are not her birth parents \"we are basically strangers\" to her and she is her real mother. My daughter told me all this and if very uncomfortable with the whole situation and with every right, now wants nothing to do with her. So i talked with X and told her that my daughter wants nothing to do with and that we will continue a relationship with her but she needs to stay away from  MY daughter.X is trying to force a relationship that does not want to be reciprocated. I think im justified here, thoughts?",

	"body" : "My mom’s house sold at auction at the end of April ‘23. On Jan 2nd ‘24 she was removed from the house. She texted me yesterday asking if she could stay with me. I had to tell her no, again. Despite all she has put me through, I still love her. My dad passed in June 2019. It’s been very hard on our family. Since his death the relationship with my mom has become strained. My brother hasn’t had a thing to do with her since Jan 2021. My mom would pit us against one another. It was a habitual cycle of distrust and manipulation by her that we have since worked through. My brother, SIL, and I have a great relationship since my mom is no longer in the picture. She blames us for her not paying her mortgage that we never knew she wasn’t paying. After the auction, she then had 10 days to vacate. Within those 10 days, she talked to the new owner and gave him her sad story. He felt bad for her and made a deal for her stay there 3 months and get her the surplus money from the sale of the house. She was supposed to use that time to find a place, pack, and move. She didn’t do that. After she got the almost 40k from him and the 3 months were up she told him to talk to her lawyer. It then went to court- she lost. She had until the end of Nov to leave. In total she had 8 months to find a place and move as well as almost 40k but still did nothing. During this time she has withheld belongings that was supposed to go to my brother and I after my dad’s passing. She refused to give us anything and would constantly make comments like “You don’t know what it’s like. You only lost a father, I lost a husband. My lose is greater than yours”. Those hurt. Jan 2nd she called me to come get whatever I wanted because they were kicking her out. She went next door and talked to my brother through the doorcam and told him the same thing. So him and I both left work to finally get our families stuff. I was then told by her that anything I took was still hers and I was just holding it for her. I told her no. Her and I argued and I walked out of the house in tears because I was so hurt and mad. She tried to have us arrested for getting stuff even though she is the one who told us to. After my SIL told her that we had her recorded on the doorcam telling us to come get what we wanted, she relented. Even after all that, I still helped her move some stuff to a storage. She ended up at a shelter that would help her find a place to stay and work with her. She has known since April that she’s not allowed at my house because my husband won’t allow her there after everything she has put me through. He has held me while I’ve bawled one too many times and can’t stand the manipulation and emotional turmoil she has put me through. She choose to bury her head in the sand and now wants to stay with me because she can’t find a place for her and 2 dobermans She is now threatening to come get the dogs even though she has nowhere to go yet, simply because she’s mad at me.",

About a year or so into their marriage, our mom started to hint at a new sibling.So you could imagine our surprise when our 40 year old mother who never wanted to marry or have a third child,tells us she’s indeed pregnant.My first thought was “isn’t this a bit soon?”We were happy for her but we didn’t want a new Sibling. Fast forward to when the baby was born, there were getting divorced.he had took the money they both saved for my mom’s maternity leave.So my mother couldn’t even enjoy her pregnancy & had to go back to work earlier than planned. This is where the problem comes in. David is basically nonexistent now. My mother is a nurse, working 8-12 hour night shifts,picking up whenever she can. While I’m a full time student & PT Operations Specialist.I started to work less hours to help her out with the baby. Since my brother had little experience w/ newborns.Left me to care for him when she wasn’t home with him.This continued for a year BUT now I feel guilty & have this growing resentment toward my mom for it.She depends on me to help her with everything.It got to a point where she would tell me not to pick up shifts so I could watch the baby more while she worked or if she wanted to go to work early for extra money. Mind you, my brother is capable to help at this point but doesn’t unless I’m not available. I never minded helping her & I’m the only person she can rely on for help.she praises me for being so helpful,but as soon as I complain about how I think it’s unfair that my life had to completely change & revolve around a baby that’s not mine.while my brother got to just lock his door ,make messes,video games all night and sleep in til 5pm, suddenly it’s “why is everything an argument with you, Why can’t you just say okay mom”.It’s like a slap in the face & makes me not want to help her.when it’s kept me from working,no sleep ,less studying, or things that make me happy.I have also  been diagnosed with Severe General Anxiety&MDD,so taking care of the baby is very difficult of me, paired with the stress of trying to get a masters in psychology&pressure to move out. My boyfriend has been more involved after noticing increased my stress level.Recently She started  talking badly about him saying“he’s a guy with nothing going for himself,I don’t know why you waste your time”.Yet He goes out of his way doing things like buying food for the house,gas in my moms car for her,groceries,Fixing things around the house ,fixing her car.All without being asked or paid for his services. So her saying that about him INFURIATED ME.Now I have been purposely pointing out her hypocrisy, putting my needs first & refusing to do anything that will not benefit me.

The old geezer (80-ish M) from next door noticed and came over to ask if she could mow the lawns once while they were on holiday. He had a very particular set of instructions of exactly how his lawns should be mowed and did not offer any money. She asked if there was anything else she could do for them, he said no.Sure enough, she mows the lawns following the instructions. For the past couple days, however, she has spent hours and hours tidying and pruning the rest of their garden. It’s summer where we are, so currently around 29 degree days (84 Fahrenheit). She has been exhausting herself working in their garden. They didn’t ask for it, they aren’t paying and she has only met them a briefly a couple of times in passing. I even saw her planting a new plant in there garden.She is an absolutely lovely woman, so kind and selfless she would give you her last dollar if you asked for it. That is kind of how they got themselves in the position they are in now living with us. I am worried this time she is overstepping. My concern is that the neighbors will be offended. I know old people can be sensitive and proud about their gardens. Or possibly they will expect her to keep doing the gardening for free. Best case scenario, they are grateful and that’s the end of it.My partner told her yesterday to stop as she’s overstepping a little bit. We would rather not be super involved with our neighbors. Maybe her time would be better spent doing volunteer gardening in places that actually requested it.Today, while my partner is out, she is back in their garden. I can guarantee she will be over there at every opportunity until they come back from their holiday.I am planning to ask her to stop again. Does this make me an asshole? Is what she is doing just incredibly kind?Edit: MIL has already done our gardens, veggie gardens, flower beds to trimming the hedges she has done everything possible at our place already - this we are very grateful for.

In general we get along pretty well, we have very different backgrounds and I sometimes find her a little out of touch but I tend to hold my tongue about these things. Likewise I'm sure she walks carefully on some issues around me.A few months ago she met this guy, Anthony, who had a girlfriend who lived in the states. They instantly connected and have been very flirty with each other. Anthony has not cheated on his girlfriend with Hannah but I do think there has been an emotional affair. He did tell Hannah he was going to break up with his girlfriend a couple of months back. This did not happen.Hannah has recently started saying she is going to make a move because she owes the girlfriend nothing and its not like it even counts as a relationship because it's long distance. I've skirted around the issue as it literally has nothing to do with me but does make me a little uncomfortable when she talks about his girlfriend. I don't like cheating. When Hannah has asked me directly what she should do I've always said I think you should look after yourself and take a step away because you are quite likely to get hurt.A few days ago when she was ranting about Anthony/ the girlfriend I said eventually \"can we stop talking about this. You know my thoughts, I don't want to help you plan on how this guy is going to cheat on his girlfriend\".She got very annoyed by the whole thing and told me I was being a bad friend and she should be able to discuss her feeling in her home.We've never had an argument before so I just kind of acknowledged what she said and left the room.

We decided to only tell our parents about it because its still early in the first trimester. My FIL was happy for us but my MIL was over the moon. She has been texting us everyday wanting updates which can be exhausting  but my husband has taken the responsibility of most updates that way im not overwhelmed and stressed out. We had our conformation appointment a few days ago and my OB did prenatal labs and scheduled us in for an ultrasound. After the appointment, my husband texted my MIL and told her everything that happened in our group chat. She followed up by asking when the ultrasound is. I told my husband that she is going to ask if she can come. I have been up front about my boundaries and told him that I'm not comfortable with anyone other than him being in the room for appointments, ultrasounds, testing, and the birth. He has been accepting of this so I didnt think it was an issue. He texted my MIL back and told her when it was. She then asked if she could be there (like I said she would) and instead of giving her a firm no, he just told her about an office policy that only allows one person to come in with the patient. She then wanted him to record it or FaceTime her during. I know that technically isn't here physically being there but I would rather my husband be more present and not be on his phone or worrying about his mom at a time like that. She then sent a text that I read as passive aggressive about her just wanting to hear the heartbeat This is where I may be the asshole. I told him that I wouldn't be giving her anymore updates regarding me or the baby. She is getting too pushy and it is making me very uncomfortable because she is acting like its her baby. It upsets me to have to be that way with my MIL and my husband also thinks we can't stop telling her anything about the baby.. So AITA?Edit to add: My MIL also told someone that I didnt know before we even decided on having kids that when we do, she will be in the delivery room to cut the umbilical cord which is why I'm worried that if I don't stop her now, the situation will only escalate.Edit #2: I've been reading comments and I realized I didn't make this extremely clear. I have voiced boundaries to MIL before but she simply ignores me with small things like not going to dinner with her at FIL unless it comes from my husband. She doesn't respect boundaries with larger issues for anyone. I have 2 examples of this. 2 years ago she wanted to visit us for Christmas while we lived in another state but my husband and I had blackout dates with our jobs and we were both working 40+ hours a week for the entire month of December so we told her that we wouldn't be able to spend time with her because of our jobs so it wouldn't be good for her to come. She got upset (naturally) and told FIL about us \"not wanting to see her\" and he immediately booked them flights and a hotel for the entire month. She then got mad at us for not spending enough time with her. The second example was when we were planning our wedding and she took completely control of the guest list, seating chart, food, etc. (I wish that was an exaggeration) but the one thing that I did without her knowing or approval was buying my wedding dress. I booked a last minute appointment with out local bridal salon. I didnt plan it out. They just happened to have an opening the week before I left town for a business trip. She called me the day before i left to make an appointment to look at wedding dresses. When i told her i already bought my dress, she was very upset because i didnt include her. I just told her it was a spur of the moment situation and no one was there with me. She still thought she should have been told and i just told her that i just wanted to get the dress so i didnt have to worry about it later.. The week im out of town I found out she got her MOtG dress and it was nothing like we had discussed and I asked her why she didn't tell me she was getting her dress and she said it was a spur of the moment thing and she just wanted to go ahead and get it so she wouldn't have to do it later. This made me cry and feel very hurt because it seemed like she did that out of spite. When I told my husband about it, he immediately called his mom and said she would need to find a dress that was more like what we had discussed and she wouldn't be wearing that one because it really upset me that she went behind my back. The next morning, my FIL called my husband and told him that since the dress was paid for she would be wearing it and he didn't know why I was upset because it was \"just a dress\".

When the mutual friend noticed my rating, she came out the gate super aggressive asking why I would rate the book so low, and then sent several angry texts to the other co-host saying how much of an AH move it is to give a rating that low and that \"no one likes book club anymore\" (funny enough that month's meeting was the best attended meeting in a couple of months) and a whole slew of other complaints. She claimed it wasn't appropriate to give the book a rating so low. For clarity, she's the only one who's ever been offended when anyone hasn't liked a book she (or her family member) nominated.

We have made the decision to spend the rest of our lives together and we spend hours talking about how our lives are going to look like in the future. We usually talk about our finances, housing situation and things that go along after marriage. We have started investing together as well in some SIPs.He is doing well for himself and loves to buy things for himself and those around him. He goes on shopping sprees and spend a good chunk of money, which sometimes I find too much. I have pointed this out to him, and he says it’s okay for me to tell him to stop when he is spending too much on things he doesn’t need.However, one thing that I particularly don’t like is when he spends on other people without thinking. A little background on his family: He has 2 sisters, one of them is married and her husband is well off who does better than my husband. The other sister is unmarried but she has a good job and does well for herself as well.My partner spends on expensive gifts like designer bags, clothes, latest tech gadgets and gives them to his sisters on multiple occasions every 3rd month. Every time they go out (my partner, his sisters and the brother in law) it’s my partner who picks up the tab every time. (I am not sure how adamant they are to pay the bill, but I know that my partner thinks it’s his responsibility to pay). He has even given the unmarried sister his credit card so she can order whatever she can, whenever she wants. The married sister gets these gifts on every occasion. Recently he bought her a very expensive phone on her birthday.In our culture, it’s important for the brother to give gifts and money to the married sister on festivals, birthdays etc but I believe he tends to overboard. I don’t mind the gifts, but I believe that it sets out back financially every time he goes overboard.A little background on me: I have a great job that I enjoy and to get married to him I would have to leave my job and move to a small city with no job prospects, whatsoever. He is doing well for himself and he works really hard but I believe that we need to seriously start saving up for ourselves and our future and spending all that money elsewhere will only set us back in our financial goals.I have tried talking to him but he says  that it’s his responsibility to take care of his sisters and everyone in the family to the best of his abilities. He thinks it is not a big deal but to me it is. I have stopped bringing this up because I don’t want him to think I have an issue with him spending on his sisters but it still bothers me every time.Am I wrong in any way?",

She looked at me and told me they were on the bookshelf in her bedroom, so I ran upstairs to look for mine. I found my older sisters, my mothers, my fathers, and my younger brothers. I wasn’t able to find mine though, so I went down the hall and asked her where mine was. She looked at me, scoffed, and said she never made one for me. I was confused for a second but thought that maybe there were some loose-leaf photos of me somewhere, so I asked if we had any. She told me “There might be some under the Christmas decorations in the attic.”I went up to the attic to try to find some and in total I found two. One of me with a group of people with my face blurry when I was around six, and one of me playing with my uncle when I was five. In this photo my back is turned to the camera, so you can’t even see my face.My parents have always told me that this isn’t a big deal but it really hurt me. I remember going to look at my siblings baby books and wonder what mine might have looked like. I’m torn between the resentment I feel about this still and how many people have told me to let it go.

	"body" : "Hi everyone, here's some context:I live with three other roommates in a house where we have hard water. It strips my hair, skin and I've had conversations with my other roommates about how bad it is for us, causing dandruff, breakouts, etc.When I bought this shower filter, none of the others contributed to it. It would have been $9 per person, but I fronted the full $36, which can be a lot of money to a college student. I initially was pretty pissed, because they all had expressed to me that they would like one, so when I bought it I was expecting them to contribute. But I let it go, and moved on, since there was no formal agreement.Fast forward to six months later, it's time to get a replacement. It's $4 per person, or $15 for one person. But, one of my roommates, Ashley (fake name) says \"i don't really notice a difference in my hair with or without it so i'm fine without it\" as an excuse not to pay. The other two seem fine with paying it.I'm annoyed because it's not as though I can just take the filter off and on at will, and I have done all the labor for it in terms of buying and installing. So essentially, Ashley is just going to be using my shower filter that she refused to pay for, AGAIN.It's $4, which leads me to believe that my roommate doesn't want to pay it on principle (her financial situation is not dire by any means). I understand that she wouldn't have bought it for herself, so why do I feel like she's being an AH for no reason? AITA???",

Recently I’ve discovered my mom magically knows about whether my room is clean where all my dirty clothes are and what was on my desk. This had me a bit confused at first but after around a month it realized she’s been going through my room. She does this when I go to school and on weekends. She not only goes through my room but she also takes my homework or worksheets that are in my desks and corrects them, keep in mind she is not a teacher I’ve told her multiple times I appreciate the fact she’s trying to be active in my education but she should back off a bit. I’ve also told her that she shouldn’t correct my work since the point of the homework is so my teachers can see what I understand and can improve on not what she knows. She always responds with “But you should be grateful that you know the answers now that I corrected your work”. Now this pisses me off a bit because she knows that I am a rather quiet person when it comes to academics I usually don’t talk about them and I don’t really need or ask for help it kind of makes me a bit uncomfortable. Recently I asked her for some privacy and told her “You don’t need to go through my room every day.” She replied with “but your my child and I need to check what your doing.” Now this made me a bit confused and mad so I said “How do you see what I’m doing in my room when im not even in my room?” Now she snapped she started going crazy and started shouting at me and at this point my dad came into this argument. My dad often comes into arguments where he has no context but always blindly defends my mother I tried to explain to him I want my privacy and there is no need for her to be in my room all the time.

So a few days ago I built I my own makeshift lock I tried it out and went to school as soon as I got back home from school the first thing my mom said was my door didn’t open and I told her that I locked it for privacy.

During those 3 years, I worked really hard and was promoted a couple of times and eventually left for a manager position at new company.Shortly after that, my best friend got fired from his job for submitting some personal expenses for reimbursement, and he asked if I could hire him on my team as I had openings that matched his skill set and experience. However, my friend, who is very intelligent is also somewhat eccentric. He often would say and do things that are inappropriate at work. His work was generally fine, not outstanding, just ok, but he was enjoyed being the contrarian and the center of attention, often times in a cringy way. Also, given that we were best friend since childhood we tended to joke around a lot and he would generally bring out an immature side of me that I did not like, especially at work.So when he asked if I could hire him, I was very anxious about the idea of him reporting to me and weather he would take me seriously as a manager or continue acting unprofessionally and being provocative for the sake of attention. But initially, I went along with it and asked him to send me his resume, which he did. However it was a very half assed resume, filled with spelling errors, poor grammar and it was obvious he did not put a lot of effort into it.  I marked up all the errors and sent it back to him to correct, and I think he was kind of annoyed by this, and sent it back to me with only half the corrections done.At this point, I called him and told him that I could not hire him, because I did not think it would be good for me to be his direct manager given our friendship and the fact that had been fired from his previous role and that he refused to acknowledge that he made a mistake on the expense reimbursement (he unsuccessfully tried to sue his past employer for wrongful termination and refused to acknowledge that he violated a pretty black and white policy). This is what I told him, but in reality I was worried that his eccentricity would make me look bad, and if he did not take me seriously as a manager, it would set the wrong example for the rest of my team. Also I was annoyed that he would not put in the effort to make a good and professional resume.Needless to say, he was very hurt by this, and basically our friendship ended as a result of this. I ran into him on a couple of occasions over the years, and have reached out multiple times, but even 10 years later he is still angry about it, because he helped me get a job and I did not do the same for him.I miss my friend very much and think about him often. I had hoped we would stay friends for life, and that our kids could grow up together, but we just were never able to reconcile. Was I wrong?",

They got engaged last year and are getting married late spring. My financial situation is extremely precarious right now, and I will be needing to find a place to live before the wedding. As the planning for the bachelorette party started up in secret, my only request was to stay local so I could participate, and the bride had insisted on that as well as she wanted everyone to participate. The plan then changed to a four day trip 10 hours away. I had to decline because I can't afford to be off work for that long (I don't have paid vacation, small business). My friend (soon to be SIL) came to me and explained that she was hurt that I wouldn't be coming, and explained that she felt that I was using my job and general dislike of big parties as an excuse to back out and not go. I attempted to explain the reason without giving away the surprise. I was told the maid of honor would pay for my share if it meant I could go. And I explained that was incredibly kind and thoughtful, but I also cannot afford to be off work 4 days without pay in my current situation. SIL and MoH both still think I'm refusing to go because I don't like parties or being far from home with people I don't know. I've explained to both of them several times and they still think I'm being hurtful by refusing. Am I the jerk here?As an update I did get my living situation figured out, and both of them have texted me to ask if I now can go to the party since I have somewhere to live. I had to re explain that I still can't afford to be off work.

I didnt know how to respond to that, so I said \"oh yes, I like to compliment people too\" and he said \"but you never compliment me\". I replied with \"there should be something that is compliment worthy\". He got offended and said I was rude. I told him, that I compliment when I find something, that stands out(something out of ordinary, like a unique color or accessory). He said, but it is still rude. I tried to explain it was only regarding his dressing sense, but we came back home, and he rushed to his room.Today, I met him in the living room and saw he was upset and asked him, \"what happened\",  And he said \"nothing, im not talking because I'm not worthy to talk to you\". I didnt understand, and asked \"what, why do u think so\" and remembered he was implying to yesterday's conversation. I just told him, i never said unworthy to talk, but just remarked about compliments. He said \"you act well\", and before I said anything, just asked me to not say anything further. I said okay, and came back to my room.I saw he also unfollowed me on Instagram.I can't see his perspective, on why he thinks he should get compliments if I dont find his dressing sense compliment worthy. I might've been too blunt, but I didnt know how to respond to, \"you never give me compliments\".Note: I did compliment him a few times on his cooking skills, his guitar skills and his voice(he sings), but never on his clothes.Please tell me, AITA, or is he overreacting.Note: He also said \"you can say anything to me, I never get hurt, exactly 15 mins before I made that comment\"",

Maddie and I are cousins and have been incredibly close since childhood, making her one of my absolute best friends. We met Jessica in high school. James is Maddie’s husband.My boyfriend and I have decided to move in together which means I’d be moving 2 hours away. We all met at Maddie and James’s, and I broke the news. They all took it fairly well and we had a small party.Maddie and James had an argument because James wanted to take his truck somewhere, and Maddie said no because he’d been drinking. This particular argument escalated, James got really mad and said something I don’t really recall to Maddie, and Maddie responded with “Who the fuck are you talking to?”, and James looks between myself and Maddie, and goes “I’m fucking talking to both of y’all!”.I was not shocked. They argue in front of me and Jessica, and drag one or both of us into it a lot. I would like it to be known that we don’t ever intervene, insert ourselves into these arguments, or even speak when they’re had, and we always ignore it.I told James that I hadn’t said a single word since they started arguing, and he had no reason to speak to me like that. I did not yell, I did not say anything more. He got up and went to their bedroom, and Maddie defended him. Maddie tells me that it’s not that serious and that’s just how he is, but I wouldn’t know that because you’re never around anymore. She said that I’m just uncomfortable with it now because I’m not here as much as I used to be. I’ve always been uncomfortable with it.Jessica and I used to be at Maddie and James’s place at least 4 days a week because Maddie’s a SAH wife and she doesn’t like to be alone. James would come home, they would argue about something, they’d drag Jessica and/or myself into it, or they’d blame us for the argument, and we’d both just sit there and shut the fuck up.I didn’t just stop coming around because I got a boyfriend. I stopped coming around because it just became a hostile environment, and now I constantly catch shit from Maddie because I stay with bf.I told Maddie that I’m leaving soon and I wanted to have a good night with everyone, and that’s difficult when I’m being dragged into their arguments. She got mad and told me that because he’s her husband, she has to have his back no matter what, that’s just the way he is, and she isn’t going to make him change the way he acts because we’re all in their house.Maddie seems firm in where she stands.

They have a good relationship, he says he sees her as a sister and I believe him but because of my husband previous relationship they never went out together with the 12 year old. Important to notate that I also speak with the 12 year old. We get along well.Lately since they 12 year old has been having bits of mood changes and  his relationship with his parents has been rocky specially with my husband so I thought that seeing my husband do something nice for the 12 year mom would lighten up the 12 year old mood. Well to my surprise the mom casually mentioned at the table how my husband tells her “love you ” sometimes time when they speak. I had no idea this was going on because it has never been done in front of me. My husband immediately said oh I said that to my best friend, my boss bla bla trying to brush it away. I got very uncomfortable to say the least. Also the mom starts talking at the table how she found porn at her 78 year old grandmas computer my husband started digging more as in like what it was, how did they look like, instead of changing the subject again I felt incredibly uncomfortable. Many sexual jokes were said after that. Mind you she is single and has been single for the last year.Here is the dilema. My husband was served yesterday with a child support and custody battle for the 8 year old. He was feeling anxious about it because he is afraid that he is going to get to see his son less. He loves his kids. That happened in the morning. We prayed, we call a lawyer, I did research online I feel like I did everything I could about that.Last night we spoke I told him how uncomfortable that made me feel. How I feel like is unacceptable for Him to tell her “love you” , that I had no idea this was going on he said that he understood and that he was not going to continue to say it but he never said in any romantic way. . I said ok but that I still was upset about it. I woke up still feeling upset about it and told him I needed some time and space.Now he is upset at me because I brought it up last night and this morning. That I didn’t take his feelings into consideration since he was already anxious last night because of the child support lawsuit. That I should know what’s more important. I said I understand it was bad timing but last night was still wrong but now I’m second guessing myself.AITA bringing this up why I knew he was going through it because of the lawsuit?",

My mom has a history of allowing her homeless friends stay at our house for what starts out as “a month” that quickly turns into 1 year+ (happened 3 times already). The last one she had over, was here because she lost her job and needed a place to stay while she looked. During her time here, she made ZERO effort to look for a job. She basically just lived here rent free until my dad and I got fed up with my mom and we had a big argument and she ended up leaving.I asked my mom why she allows these people to live here for so long, and she says it’s fine because “they help around in the house”.

She was obviously stressed about all that, so when she was especially sensitive to any perceived criticism, and would react with remarkable anger, and would be a long time cooling off, I figured it was a product of al that stress, and went out of my way to smooth things over.We had many arguments, during which she'd take any cheap shot she could think of to hurt my feelings.It all came to a head when I went on vacation. I'd helped her out with her lease, but despite giving her more and more money she had to move out. She house-sat for me while I was away, and put her stuff in storage, which I paid for. She took her essentials to my place while I was away.She picked fights over imaginary stuff almost every day I was away and did a terrible job looking after my place. When I got home, after a couple of days having anxiety attacks whenever I walked in the house, I told her she needed to move out and find her own place. She'd already registered herself to vote at my address, and registered her daughter for school in my neighborhood, and I felt really guilty because she still wasn't working. I offered to help her find a decent but affordable apartment in the school district, which she refused. I told her I'd pay her storage through the end of the year, but not after that.What followed was a nightmare where she maligned me to anyone she had contact info for, threatened to sue and had a lawyer send an \"illegal eviction\" notice. She went to the police to get a TRO when she came to pick up some of her stuff, and I was there, working from home. She claimed I was \"trying to coerce her into the house against her will\" and in her mind, that was DV. Anyone who knows me knows what a ridiculous claim that is, and I've never had a physical altercation with an SO in my life, certainly not with her. She was angling to get a legal order to let her back in the house, with a restraining order so that I couldn't be there at the same time, effectively stealing my home from me. It didn't work, because none of these claims were remotely true, and as far as I know, she never even got as far as officially filing anything.This was all late last summer. It is now 4 months later. I've paid for her storage since then, but when I got the bill for January's storage fees, I removed my credit card from the account, and told her the same day that she'd need to arrange to pay it herself. Today she insists that I owe her still, and should continue to pay for her storage …by sending her cash via Venmo, no less, not directly to the storage company.  AITA for not continuing to pay?

A few years back we stopped giving presents to the cousins and their kids (who are now in college) because it was too much and everyone agreed as such.

Both of my kids ages 12 and 6, got nothing from anyone. Now, here's what irks me. My wife and I always made it a point to give presents to my cousins and their kids until their kids were in high school. Every year my sister and her son get a gift from us. She gave us nothing. My younger son, 6, is very aware of his surroundings. He said to me \"Dad, I thought this was my family, how come they didn't give me anything?\" Im a grown man, but when he said that it felt like a Tommy Morrison left hook. I thought we were closer to the family so as not to be completely overlooked. He picked up on this on his own without my wife and me saying anything.

They just announced they are expecting their third, and my first reaction was an exasperated sigh, which understandably angered them. I explained myself as best as I could but they are still insisting I’m an AH who “hates their kids.”Here’s the thing. I love my nephew and niece, and I am going to love the third. But Lucas and Lily require so much help already that having a PLANNED third right now seems… unwise.Since my niece was born (the 3-year-old) Lucas has lost three jobs. He left the first job willingly for another one that me, my fiancée, and our parents all tried to tell him was a scam, and it was. His first job wouldn’t hire him back. He recently lost his third job because he got into a shouting match with coworkers over something minor.He’s now trying to launch his own business. Our dad gave him a hefty loan, but Lucas has spent it poorly and his business is not going to take off anytime soon. Additionally, they moved from their 2-bedroom apartment into a 3-bedroom, which I get, but they can’t afford it. Every couple of months me or our mother will put money out for their rent.Lily works very part time. Lucas is trying to do DoorDash as much as he can. I watch the kids in some capacity 3 days a week, and they stay the night with me once per week. I do this because I love them and their home environment isn’t the best because Lucas and Lily are always stressed and arguing. On top of working myself, this is tiring.Now that the third is on the way, I know they will need more money and more help, and I get more tired thinking about it. I apologized for my initial reaction but they’re saying I’m an AH and don’t like them or their kids.I also noticed they didn’t cancel me watching them this week so I’m not sure if they actually feel that way.AITA?ETA Lily REALLY struggled with her second pregnancy and needed more frequent help with my niece so I’m also anticipating that.",

When I checked the pantry on Tuesday the box of ramen was half empty. I asked my mom and she hadn’t eaten any but said my cousin had asked for one the day before. This annoyed me, 3 packs in 2 days? I took the ramen and put it on the top shelf of the pantry semi hidden behind the paper towels. The next day I got home and she was eating another pack. That’s when I took the whole thing and put it in my room. The next day she looked and when she couldn’t find them she called my mom to let her know “we” needed her to get more because “we” were out.

The primary reason for our trip is to attend my older brothers (bart) baby shower. My younger brother (Tim) in his twenties also lives out of state and specifically traveled back to spend time with me. He was staying with my parents, while my wife and I prefer to stay with her family since staying with mine can be chaotic and stressful. My wife and I had a packed schedule to see both sides of the family as well as friends.Planned in advance, Bart, his wife Lola, Simone and I were to play DND. A prior invitation to Tim to play DnD online suggested to me that DnD did not interest him since he scoffed at the idea. The night prior to playing DnD, I was exhausted and went to bed early.Wednesday morning, I looked at my phone and there was a message from Tim asking what my plan was tomorrow. I misread the sent date/time, and this is where I feel awful. I interpreted his message as having been sent that morning. If I had read correctly, I would have realized it was sent the night prior asking what I was doing on Wednesday. I responded to the message as I interpreted it thinking he referenced Thursday.Wednesday evening was a blast playing DnD. It was a great gathering that made fun connections and memories. Unfortunately the most memorable facet was the aftermath. All of our phones had missed calls from my mom. She left a few messages trying to figure out why Tim was not invited to the game night. This was followed up by my Dad texting Bart and I that we were raised better than this and that all four of us should be ashamed of ourselves.Simone and I leave, but it got way worse when Bart gets on the phone with our parents, and it develops into an explosive screaming match in which past drama was dug up. Hurtful words were exchanged. Lola heard the conversation and let Simone and I know. After the hurtful conversation Bart uninvites my parents to the baby shower. It honestly put a dark shadow on an otherwise lovely trip home. It may have even altered the dynamic between Bart, Lola and my parents.Tim felt that I had intentionally deceived him about the plan to play DnD when I would never want to make him feel excluded. I did apologize to Tim. He, Bart and I are on decent terms now.Tim has not always had positive interactions with the sisters in law. Bart and I have done our best to keep everyone happy, but Tim can antagonize and make the situation uncomfortable.  Although the perceived exclusion was based on a misunderstanding, I did not specifically give him an invite both because of his lack of interest coupled with his dynamic with Bart, Lola, and Simone.I felt that my actions caused this rift in my family.

She is disabled and cannot work. so I have always had sympathy for her.When I started dating her son she wanted to spend a lot of time with me which I didn't see issue with as I already knew her. This was a mistake.No amount of time spent with her was enough. She felt entitled to every ounce of free time I had. She needed me to do everything with her and would guilt trip me even if I had work or plans with friends. She would manipulate me by planning a dinner without me knowing or set up the patio with drinks and snacks so if I dropped by, I would feel bad if I couldn't stay long.  Anytime I was over there with my bf she would try to be apart of all our time together and would linger where we were and stare at us until we invited her into the convo.Boundaries needed to be set with her. She did not take it well. My bf let her know that she was asking for way too much.She started acting out in some dramatic ways. She would stomp around the house when I was over, started saying I couldn't spend the night because me and my bf aren't married, told us she felt excluded, like we were avoiding her by spending time in his room. We tried facilitating this by watching movies in the living room, that of which she interrupted constantly by talking or making as much noise in the kitchen as possible- slamming cupboards, turning on the garbage disposal for minutes at a time, rustling through plastic bags, and other attention seeking behaviors. What made me lose all respect was when she started protesting against my boyfriend taking me on dates by telling him not to spend his money or waste gas.Her behavior after having simple boundaries set made me really dislike her and see how manipulative she is. I've been told to attribute this selfish mindset to her disease so it makes me feel ableist to dislike her for that reason. She suffocated all chances of me wanting to have any kind of relationship with her which she protested by saying that it would be very hard on her son, which might be true considering the living situation.

At first it would start out as me being told my bithday or christmas present hadn't arrived in the mail, just for me to discover they bought it weeks later. Then they began to give presents that had clearly been opened or used prior to me getting them.At first I kind of ignored it, because I didn't want to make a fuss about getting a disapointing present. However, last christmas really takes the cake. I wasn't celebrating christmas with my brother and Camilla, so I assumed we would hand out presents for each other next time we would see each other.That seemed to be the case for the rest of my family, but then my brother gave a strict order to both me AND my mom, that I would need to open his and Camilla's present on christmas day. I didn't really question it, so it went in the pile with the rest of the presents.When I opened it it consisted of a piece of paper wrapped around an empty toiletpaper roll. On the paper was written, that my brother and Camilla had decided to give me 150$ for a trip I am going on this summer. No money was included in the package, and I know that for sure because three people inspected it just to make sure.I then decided to ask him the following day if it was on Paypal or when I would get the money, because I thought maybe they would wait until payday. They have done that before, so I didn't think much of it first.My whole family was there when I asked him when the money would be given to me, and Camillas face immediately turned stiff and pale. My brother said that the money should have been in the packaging, but I said it was nowhere there. He then couldn't pinpoint where he had put the money - if it was in the wrapping paper, inside the folded piece of paper or inside the toiletpaper roll. All this time Camilla said nothing and just starred in the opposite direction. He said I must have thrown it away by accident, when I insisted on not having seen it.I was pissed afterwards that the brother I always loved had tried to gaslight me on christmas day by trying to convince me I had thrown away 150$ dollars. I suspect that Camilla had a huge part to play, as she seems to dislike me a lot and has been progressively colder towards me in the past couple of years. But I can't help to dislike my brother because of it too, as I just can't see why one could do such a thing to their own little sister - even when pressured into it.I've always bought nice present for them and their daughter, but I don't think I will be buying anything for my brother and Camilla from now on.

It didn't make sense to me that she thought I couldn't handle being a bridesmaid, but wanted to pencil me in as an assistant, which is about the same amount of work.I said I was okay with it and ruminated on it for a day before realizing it actually hurt a lot that she would even suggest that.When I told her it hurt me that she didn’t talk to me about not being in the wedding before sending me an invite with next to zero communication, she claimed it’s because we barely talked and never hung out anymore.We live about 1.5 hours away from each other and I can’t drive, but my boyfriend of 3 years has always been more than willing to drive me to her so we could spend time together, and she always had some excuse why we couldn’t and the conversation dropped. I’ve never even met her fiancé because of this, and the last time I saw her (like 2mos pre-engagement) he was sick, and I couldn’t risk seeing him.We’re both adults with lives and it’s normal for us not to talk like we did all the time when we were younger. She told me she picked her college roommate (who she’s complained about more than once to me) to be a bridesmaid instead of me.I’m not as hurt that she didn’t choose me as I am that she didn’t even talk to me about it or ask if I’d be able to do it. I’ve always had such open and honest communication with everyone around, and I thought she’d at least say “hey do you think you’ll be able to be in my wedding” or something to that effect.I guess I wanna know if I’m the AH for being upset that she didn’t even think of me in her plans or talk to me about my involvement after years of us talking about being in each others weddings.Edit: Many are thinking I’ve barely talked to her in six months, never see her, etc. but it’s not the truth. It’s simply the excuse she used. Obviously when we were closer in distance, we saw each other more often because duh. But she never gave any indication the last several times we’ve talked, or seen each other, that she was pulling away. We’re both adults, and it is extremely unrealistic for her to expect us to talk and hang out all the time. When I went to my last appointment in her city, she dropped everything to come see me and give me a hug after it was over. She texts me when she needs someone to talk to and she’s bored at work, etc. I could not have known she was pulling away because the last several times we’ve connected, everything was fine until a couple days ago.",

There's five of us, and we met in elementary school and have been extremely close ever since.One of these friends is a girl we'll call Melanie. Melanie is the only girl in the group, however that's never really been a big deal. None of us have ever seen her as different, and so we grew up with her going to sleepovers with us and basically doing all the same stuff we did with each other. Well, recently our friend, who we'll call Dan, got a girlfriend. I didn't originally have a problem with her her, until last week. My friends and I had made plans to go over to one of our houses to hang out, but when we got there, I and the other two noticed very quickly Melanie wasn't there. I ended up mentioning this to Dan, and he said he told her she shouldn't come. I was confused, since Dan and Melanie were just as close as the rest of us.He explained that his girlfriend didn't like Melanie because she only had male friends, and apparently that was a sign of a hoe. (Melanie is the farthest thing from a \"hoe\") He said that since his girlfriend didn't like her and didn't want them to be friends, he had stopped talking to Melanie. I was obviously upset by this, and told him that it was kind of messed up to just ditch one of his best friends of 17 years because of someone he met 3 months ago. He got defensive and said his girlfriend was just jealous that Melanie and him were close, but I told him that there was nothing different about our friendship with Melanie then our friendship with each other.We argued like this for a little until I gave up at trying to make him realize that he was being a jerk, and just left. The next day I woke up to a ton of texts and calls from him, and even some from his girlfriend. The texts we're sort of rude, with his girlfriends being much nastier. Just them telling me I'm jealous of their relationship, and that I'm trying to break them up.I just don't understand what made him go from not caring Melanie was a girl, to suddenly only seeing her as a girl and not one of his best friends.

My girlfriend is a math teacher and we talked about her potentially hosting a review class for extra money in one of the meeting spaces.She asked me about certain dates that happened to coincide with a major town wide  event right next to the hotel - the World Cup of cricket. She knows that this is going to be the highest revenue generating event of the year for the hotel and that I have been strategizing about the best way to approach it and have been turning down many groups as to hopefully be the last closest option and be able to charge a premium. We have 3 meeting spaces and with all the guest rooms also comes meeting spaces whether for team meals, team meetings, etc. Even if we got some sort of media staff we can’t have 100 people go over load our breakfast restaurant at once so we push big groups into a meeting space with a breakfast buffet as Courtyards do not have a buffet. I have deliberately turned away any meeting room only business over those dates as to save my space for the right group.When she asked me about the dates I tried explaining the situation that teams or staff or media potentially need the space and she said why does cricket need meeting space? I explained what I just wrote above about how if we need to give all these people breakfast we can’t do it in our restaurant, team meeting etc. and that my bosses are expecting banquet revenue out of this somehow as well. She kept pressing me that she just needs a yes or no and I kept trying to explain the situation in hopes that she may let me off the hook.Eventually after a tense conversation I said no not right now I can’t risk losing 2 weeks worth of something extremely profitable because I have 2 days of your event and she wasn’t mad but there was tension. She said the way I handled it she just would have preferred a direct answer but it’s very hard to say no to your girlfriend of 7 years.

Then we got a puppy..... My MIL has literally had 1 older dog in a short amount of time so has absolutely no clue about dogs let alone the breed we have. She's been bit multiple times by him and let's him get in the trash and leaves it for me to clean up, over the summer would take him on walks when it was over 88 degrees and would leave him on our back porch in direct sun. I had gotten to the point I would put him in his kennel in the AC downstairs before I would leave and asked her to just leave him in there til I got home 2 hours later. She refused. The first time she let him out and didn't put him back in his cage. When I got home he got into 2 unopened bags of dog treats bag and all plus a bag of muffins bag and all. He was sick for 3 days after and she thought it was funny. The last round she sent me rude texts telling me she was letting him out, that she was going to do whatever she wanted, that I'm controlling and dramatic and that my dog was suffering. I missed work because I had enough and went home. I got home and the dog was on the porch again in the direct sun, mind you it was 94 out this day.

I started posting more often on my stories, mostly funny memes. Occasionally, I would post a selfie of me trying a new hairstyle or makeup look that I really enjoyed. After I posted a story of my gym access card saying it's time to do something for myself, Josh messaged me privately saying \"ok you don't have to post everything on your story\". He went on to say that I should only post good moments on my page, and that \"when I achieve an amazing body then that'll be something worth posting, people will actually commend you for it\".I was taken aback because 1) it's my page and I can post whatever I want, and 2) although he said I can post whatever makes me happy he kept going on about how it's better to follow his method of posting and jokingly offered to be my social media manager. He went through my entire instagram page and even asked why I still have my post about my UMAT preparation. To give more context, Josh has also commented on my body on how I haven't reached my full potential multiple times, at its worst he would mention it at least once a day. I have set boundaries with him, explaining that I understand where he's coming from and that I agree that I'm not in the best shape that I can be. However, I don't appreciate him constantly mentioning it in every conversation. He had apologized and backed off from it mostly until this happened.Ever since that conversation, we went from talking almost everyday to almost no contact.

He texted me a couple times asking when I'm free, but I just brushed it off and have been in no contact since.I understand to an extent on where he's coming from as my ex is still following me on socials. I get that he might be trying to tell me things from a different perspective, and how my increased postings could seem desperate to my ex. However, I no longer feel comfortable with my friend telling me what he thinks about what I post, it feels like it's either his way or the high way. It would be reasonable to start this conversation if I was consistently posting about the breakup or sad things, but this was not the case.

Since we connected, we have been building a relationship, with mutual visits and occasional phone calls. (We live on opposite sides of the country.)He got divorced a few years ago and since then has been dating “Liz”. Liz is significantly younger than he is, and is an extrovert with a big personality. She was widowed a few years ago and she and my dad (who had known each other for years) started dating shortly thereafter.My dad recently retired and bought a condo in Florida. He suggested coming to my house for Christmas and then the two of us roadtripping across the country to his condo as a fun father-child bonding experience. I agreed that it sounded fun, and so we spent late December and early January adventuring together.In the course of our discussions, he told me that Liz had done a number of things which make me concerned for him. For instance, she decided she wanted him to move in with her, so she sent him to see one of his other children for a week and while he was gone she went to his house, gave away most of his possesssions, and moved some of her friends into his house. He was very upset, but she told him he was being irrational and needed to move on. When he decided to buy his condo in Florida, she told him that she would be in charge of decorating it, then proceeded to insist on choices of furniture and dishes which are deeply impractical for day-to-day use — for instance, insisting that the only dishes be his grandmother’s china set, none of which is dishwashable, and which contains so many place settings it completely filled the kitchen cupboards leaving almost no room for food. Whenever he tries to assert his preferences or tastes or the need for practicality, she gets upset and gives him ultimatums.Over the course of the time we spent together, he talked through all of this with me and was clearly upset by it.I finally told him that it seemed like many of the dynamics in their relationship aren’t very healthy, and that he needed to be willing to set boundaries that gave him some control over his own life and choices. We subsequently purchased a few needed practical things for the condo without Liz’s blessing, about which she is now irate.In my subsequent conversations with my father, it seems increasingly likely their relationship is going to end.Liz told him I’m being TA because she’s known him longer than me (true) and she spends more time with him (also true) and that I’m just stirring up trouble I don’t have to face the consequences for.AITA?",

Since then I have put A LOT of effort into styling and decorating the house (like 99% of the effort). He is a stereotypical straight man in his 20s in the sense that the house would probably have little to no decor if he lived alone simply because decor is not an interest of his or a priority.

With that being said, his dad has put the antlers on a plaque for him as a sort of trophy.My fiancé is wanting to put this plaque on top of the fireplace in our living room.

I’m not opposed to having them hung in the house, just not as the center of the home.My compromise was to put it in the basement, or the dining room, or the spare bedroom which is entirely his.

One thing is that I prefer to cook a meal, eat it and then wash up after. He prefers to wash up as he goes along and thinks it’s ‘silly’ to do what I do. In the same vein, he always unpacks his clothes into hotel wardrobes, whereas I don’t. I find it a bit pointless unless it’s a long stay, and I worry I’ll lose stuff if I go putting it in unfamiliar places. Instead I just use my suitcase as a base and keep everything within that refined space. Depending on what the item is, I might fold it and I might not.

He has an armchair in his bedroom which I use as my ‘clothes chair’. I lay items onto it, one over the back and both arms. He calls this ‘messy’ in jokey tone. He also then comments on my use of the bathroom. Conversely, I like to lay my products out of my washbag on a shelf, because I reach for them regularly. He also audibly comments that this is messy.It starts to grate on me because I’m not a messy person, but instead just have fundamentally different habits to him. It frustrates me because he can’t see that jsut because it’s different to him, doesn’t make his way ‘right’ and mine ‘wrong’.We didn’t argue, but we do have a bit of a heated debate. He says why didn’t I just use the chest of drawers - I say there’s no point because we’re here for 48 hours, also he never offered me the drawers, I assumed they’d be full of his things.Ultimately, getting called ‘messy’ several times makes me feel judged, and it also reminds me of my ex who was abusive and very criticalAITA the asshole for putting up a fight about such a small thing, should I just have conceded and done what he asked me to do?",

Like all teachers she gives me rows and has an answer to everything, which is fine. This year I’ve started my AS qualifications and she teaches me for 2 out of 4 of my subjects which is great as previously stated we get on amazing.Most of my friends are in the younger years, year 10-11 which isn’t so bad as there’s a year, 2 most between us. I absolutely love my friends as they’ve been there for me through everything even though they are a bit younger than me.I bumped into my teacher in the corridor while she was on duty and we got to talking. We started talking about the people I hang out with, which I told her that I like my friends in the younger years as they get me more than my “friends” in my year do. The people in my year group I absolutely hate, they’re all fake with nothing better to do than talk about another and then be fake friends with them as soon as they walk into the room. I explained all this to her and she told me: “You’re in year 12 now, you shouldn’t be hanging around those people, while they’re trying to get out of lesson you are in yours. They will pull you down with them and you will fail. You need to cut them out of your life before they ruin it.” She said some other things that I don’t really remember much but they were along the same lines. This really ticked me off as those girls are my life so I just started screaming at her, I have never in my life yelled at her before so this came as a shock to anyone that was in the same corridor as us. I just carried on yelling like it was nothing.As I was yelling, my head of year and assistant head walked by and just stood and stared at me while I was still yelling. She had made me really mad and upset and that had set me off. As soon as I stopped yelling I realised who was there and how many people were staring and I immediately felt bad. I apologised immediately and ran off hoping it wouldn’t come up again.I had her later that day and she kept me behind to talk about what had happened and I explained that I was sorry but she was out of line.Looking back at it now she was just looking out for me and she didn’t deserve to be spoken to like that in front of her students and peers. I still stand by my points and do not regret yelling at her, we are still as close as we’ve ever been. But people are telling me that I was the asshole for reacting like that.So AITA for yelling at my teacher?EDIT: Just to add, I apologised immensely and done so for a few days after. We had a sit down and a talk about what happened and why I had lashed out. We talked it through and we’re completely fine. She said she understood why I lashed out but if I feel that way about something she says again to go see her privately, which I have done. I understand what I done was out of line but I made amends. She is my favourite teacher and I would never do anything to ruin our relationship on purpose. Anyone who bottles things up and takes it out on the wrong people should understand. I am also neurodivergent which I now understand may have had a role in my outburst.I am so thankful to have a teacher that understands me and instead of yelling back, just talks to me.Yes I am still friends with the girls in the younger years and no I will not be dropping them.",

I told her that she didn't have to make me anything special, and that I would only eat sides as don't like making people accommodate me. She then asked me if I was okay removing the meat from her dish, give the meat to someone else and eat it. I told her that I could do that and we had an agreement. She was fine with me doing it and I was fine with it too as I don't mind eating food that had meat cooked with them (for simplicity).Well, when we had dinner, I started to remove the meat from the dish as we had agreed but then one of my other aunts started berating me.

And the food I put in my plate was hers.I apologized,  told her I had asked my other aunt and she said it was okay, that I didn't know it was her dish otherwise I would have asked.

Anna had a few gap years before starting a Bachelor of Science majoring in Physics. She has just finished her second year.Whilst we were drinking at her boyfriend (Marks) NYE party, she mentioned how lucky I am to be studying a DVM because I get to hang out with kittens and puppies. I told her I'm very grateful to be studying this but it is a lot of work and the academic workload is a lot on top of placement as well.She jokingly said, \"well at least its not quantum physics!\" I laughed and told her I'd like to see her elbow deep in a cow's ass.She almost immediately changed tone and said \"I wish my studies were that easy, I've got books upon books of equations to complete.\" She then went on to say how she'd wanted to be a vet when she was a child and how she should have chosen it since its a lot easier than her current degree. She raved for a bit about how hard she studies and how easy it must be for me to slack off and spend time prancing around on a farm for credits.I told her I was just joking around and that vet school is actually quite intense, in fact its very difficult to get into. I explained its why I completed an undergrad degree first, and that I think a lot of people really underestimate how difficult it is, despite being a medical doctorate.Anna snapped back and said \"well I got into physics school, so it shouldn't be that difficult.\"I told her to get f*cked and got up and left. Spent new years with my family instead. Vet school has been really hard for me and hearing her be so dismissive set me off, especially because I've never heard anyone say \"physics school\" before. She just seemed really intent on saying how much worse she has it. I ended up forgetting about it but 3 or 4 days later, Mark (Anna's bf, party host) sent me a message asking me to apologize to Anna.

I will tell my kids “no” and mom will say “its fine, let them do it.”My mom knows that we will not allow Arya to have a cell phone until she is at least 12 yo for various reasons. About a year ago, my mom gave Arya an old cell phone of hers to play with. I didn’t like it, but I conceded and said “no internet.” I found out my mom had given Arya internet. I said I didn't like it. I told Arya she wasn’t allowed to have internet at home but she could still play on the phone. Arya connected the phone to the internet using the WiFi password I have in a frame in the guest bedroom - my mistake. Arya spent her time on the phone watching YouTube (not allowed activity). I explained it was warning one and she wasn’t allowed on it and to get off. I caught her a third time and I took away the phone indefinitely. My mom knew I wasn’t happy that she started this whole thing, but I let it go because Arya was the one who made the series of bad choices.

She got defensive. She explained what she told my daughter to do with the situation and said they had a talk with her about how it was wrong. Never once telling her to talk to me. I told her I understand why she didn’t give me a heads up but that I expected her to at least tell her to come to us and accept responsibility, not hide it and continue to lie about it.

I was grabbing drinks with a friend, she is curious about autism (suspects that she may be as well), I realised I never really talked to my ex about it. I was open about my mental and physical health (I spent a good chunk of my childhood in Hospital due to this I do have quite a bit of trauma, and I am hesitant to have biological kids but not against donation or adoption). I will admit I never brought it up specifically due to the stigma around it, but it also was never an issue afaik during the relationship.

(i dont remember what exactly it was) i said sure, and she started going on about how she didnt have to make me something i liked, that she could be “one of those” parents and make me something she knew i hated. i didnt really know what to say to this and was in a worse mood at this point, so i decided to say nothing. she took great offence to this, because then she started yelling at me. she said;“you know, im sick and tired of the silent treatment. you’ve been treating me like shit lately and i dont have to take it. the silent treatment is actually a form of abuse, so you need to stop this now.”i was obviously appalled because i couldnt imagine that she was going to imply that i try to abuse her, and after a couple seconds of stunned silence, she yelled again. i came up with a half assed response about how i literally just said the word “sure.” but she retaliated by saying the word was rude. like i didnt care about the hard work she put into making me and my siblings a meal. i was genuinely so confused at this point and couldn’t get more than a few stutters out. the car ride was silent the rest of the way home, and once there i just went to my room and cried.i understand that she was probably feeling hurt by my attitude, but i am currently in the process of healing and am working on that. i dont mean to hurt her feelings or be outwardly hateful with her, its just hard on the bad days. most of the time i dont even recognize im doing it, but maybe thats more of a me problem. i dont think im abusive to my mother. can anyone tell me if im in the wrong here?",

	"body" : "For some context, I’m (22F) currently living with a friend (23F) and her family b/c of some complicated stuff that happened in the past.That being said, I live in a dominican/hispanic household where my friend and her brother (24M) were raised kind of traditionally (women cook and clean/men provide financially).The thing is, I never feel comfortable cooking for my friends brother because /he/ never cooks or cleans. I grew up in a household where it didn’t matter if you were a man or woman, cooking and cleaning were basic life skills and you had to learn them. To add onto this, I’m not particularly close with her brother either.The last time I tried to cook for my friend (and my friend only) he kept hovering around the kitchen, opening and closing cupboards absentmindedly, trying to bring quiet attention to himself, and I started to feel a little guilty for not cooking any for him.I told my friend (privately) that I don’t want to cook for him because he never helps out with household chores, and she said: “that doesn’t mean he doesn’t deserve to eat!” as if someone cooking for him is his only lifeline and only way of getting food…She also made the excuse that he financially contributes to the home, but so do I. I pay rent to their mother every month, so I don’t see how he can’t cook/clean too.I get the feeling that he doesn’t appreciate that I don’t cook for him, but if I’m financially contributing to the home, cooking AND cleaning while he plays video games all day, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth I guess.Edit: Since people were getting confused, there’s only 4 people in the household. My friend, her brother, their mother and myself. My friend and her mother both cook and clean and my friends brother doesn’t help with any household chores.My friend and her mother cook, but they’re both so busy with work that sometimes my friends brother won’t get anything to eat until their mother comes home to cook for him. Their mother doesn’t get back until late at night, meaning I don’t really get the chance to cook for her (b/c I sleep early). I cook for my friend on occasion but most of the time I’m just cooking for myself.",

Every weekend I was shipped off to my grandmothers house in another town when I was younger - this only ended when she passed when I was 10.I have always been a bit shy and completely against confrontation, I am a people pleaser, and in trying to make everyone else around me happy I always seem to make myself miserable especially trying to keep my mum and husband, 38m, happy.My mother has 5 sisters and 6 brothers, and in recent years has seemed to burn bridges with pretty much all of them.My mother works Monday to Friday, then on Saturdays and Sundays, I feel like she just assumes she can just come to my house to \"see her grandchildren\" 5f and 4m.Except, she just sits at my kitchen table, drinks coffee and eats whatever she wants. She butters toast without a plate on top of the counter, doesn't wipe it down and doesn't put anything away, and generally leaves a trail of destruction in her path.When she gets fed up of that, she gets the kids riled up and wants to take them out to do whatever she wants, or for me to drive her places as she doesn't drive. It's my weekend too and I want to do things with my Children too.As a notorious people pleaser, recently diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression, my Dr has told me I need to start saying no and putting myself first. My husband agrees, he works some of the weekend and says she puts me in a bad mood when she visits.Cut to last weekend, she called I said no she couldn't come down as we were about to get something to eat and then have a family day. She became short, her tone completely changes and said \"OK, that's alright then\" in a way I could only describe as a 'well F you then\"It's been over a week now, I've tried to call her several times, she has not answered. The anxiety is bubbling in the pit of my stomach and I just don't know what to do. I don't think I am in the wrong, I just feel bad as she has completely alienated herself from everyone, she doesn't have any real social circles, has lunch with 1 friend from school a few times a year and is single.

This would take place in the city since we all live pretty far. The older girls (27 & 25) want the underage ones to be able to drink. The plan would be either the legal girls order drinks for them or they sneak vodka into the restaurant. The legal age for drinking where am from is 18.I feel uncomfortable about this. There's no point in pretending that people underage don't drink however the two girls who are underage have never drank. The 17 year-old is my best friend and she's been wanting to drink for a while now however her birthdays quite a while away. The 16 year-old is autistic and has problems with anxiety. The plan isn't to just \"drink\" I don't have a problem with that, they want to get drunk (not my words, the words of the the girls aged 16,17,25,28). Then afterwords we would all take the train back alone to our places since we live far. I personally don't plan on drinking much, I don't want to get drunk and probably won't stay out long but both the underage girls want to. I can't help but feel like it's unsafe, the 16 year-old has never taken a train herself and is vulnerable due to her being autistic. I don't believe her mother is aware of what's happening. My best friend has anxiety and I honestly don't know if she's ever taken the train alone before (not something we've really discussed I've only known her since last year). The city we are going to isn't the nicest, I'm originally from the city and even I don't think it's safe, the crime rate is up dramatically lately and even people from the city are avoiding going out as much as possible. I didn't think my friend (27) would do something like this, I honestly think a lot less of her because of it. It's well known in the group that the 16 year-old is very naive and vulnerable and that my best friend has anxiety so them taking the train home drunk just seems like a recipe for disaster. The only thing I can think of doing is to maybe report it to the college or their  parents but I just know my relationship with my friends would be over but I want them to be safe.So WIBTA and am I just being dramatic?Also just for reference the train is 50 minutes for me, 45 for the 16 year-old and 1 hour for my best friend.

Of course our 2 year old is going to want to sit next to the bubbles. We got there just as the dinner rush was beginning so the tables quickly began to fill up.I told my husband to sit down so we could get a good spot and I’ll get the food. As soon as I sat down with the food a SUV with LED headlights pulls into the parking lot facing directly into the restaurant right where we were seated and the direction in which our 2 year old is facing.My kid squinted their eyes. And I raised my hand to block my child’s eyes so he could continue to eat in peace. I didn’t think anything much of the lights at first, yes the restaurant was light up like mid-day but I figured the person was getting out of their car and the lights would be off in a minute or so. I kept eating and moved my hand to protect my child’s eyes.My husband was getting visibly annoyed though because no one had gotten out of the car after it had parked several minutes ago. Finally in walked a man around our age, but the lights were still on. My husband politely said “Sir could you please turn off your lights?” To which the man just grumbled something. At this point it had easily been 10 minutes with his lights facing us. Yes we tried moving our kid, but he began to cry because he wanted to sit by dad/ the bubbles and we didn’t want to disturb the other patrons. Me moving to a different spot would not have helped because I’m woefully short and my child refuses to eat unless he is standing so my shadow wouldn’t have protected his eyes. And again this was peak dinner hour so there was no where else to sit.My husband again asked the man “sir could you please turn off the lights?” This time the man replied “no, my family is in there.” My husband said “we aren’t asking for you to turn off your car, just the lights”.He grumbled and walked away to see the menu but came back on the phone walked right next to and spoke loudly while making faces to us to show his displeasurement. He tried to walk away when I told him he was the one willfully blinding people and using the excuse that your family is in the car when again we just asked that you turn the LEDs off, not the car.He began to berate us and further words were exchanged between us. Which then caused the man to become further angry. He sarcasticly said “you guys are being great examples to your kid right now” and I told him “yes we are teaching him to stand up for himself against the likes of people who think that it’s ok to blind a 2 year old with LED lights”So Reddit am I, we the asshole for asking a man to turn off their lights?",

	"body" : "I (21F) am apart of a large family with our fair share of  issues. My cousin (27F) is one of those golden children of the family. I used to idolize this cousin, because she was the cool babysitter who made life interesting and made me feel cool by proxy. She even made my first prom experience an amazing one by paying for a set of nails. It all came to an abrupt halt when she started treating me differently and my immediate family after she dropped out of college and moved back home permanently after years of closeness. She stopped visiting and talking with us at family events. She even skipped birthdays and my graduation without a word unless my mother called, which made it hard for me to adjust with this sudden low contact relationship.Fast forward she now has a step-son and a bio son (2) with her husband, with the two year old being babysat while both parents work during the week (one an electrician and the other a retail store worker as well as a cheer coach for her old cheer team) by our grandmother (71F). Grandma's husband was diagnosed with cancer. It has been difficult to really face the truth but the real problem lies with the babysitting, where my cousin's son has still been going to our grandmother's home to be watched. My mother and I were unaware of this until we found out that my step-grandpa was officially put on hospice and grandma confessed that she was still watching the two year old. My mother and I had serious concerns for my grandmother not being able to spend the final moments with her husband. I am unemployed, and as such volunteered for my grandma to watch him instead, getting back to my aunt (40+) and cousin. I am capable and willing to take care of him at my newly leased apartment with my partner (24M) for two days and seeing how things go. My cousin never got in contact with me during this stage, not until the day of and texted to see what was happening but not much else. My cousin lives only a minute or so away from my new place, but it was actually my aunt who had to drop him off at 5:50 AM for Thursday and Friday. This put a strain on my partner who has varied shifts (opening to close), who revealed that we shouldn't babysit unless there is payment. I disagreed at first. I felt uncomfortable about requesting payment because of the family situation and I really wanted to help my grandmother (I still can remember how thankful she had been when I agreed, I'd hate if they sent her back to babysitting instead of me). My partner couldn't believe they weren't paying or offering payment like others before me.I ended up talking to my cousin and informed her that I don't know if I can keep babysitting as I should be hearing back about a job soon and that the early drop off time was affecting my partner.

	"body" : "Me and my husband have been fostering older kids for a while and recently, he’s been made aware of a 12 year old autistic boy (let’s call him Ted) in need of a foster family. I’m not sure of the politically correct term since autism is a spectrum and all that, but this kid is very autistic. He would likely need a caregiver into adulthood.I have ADHD and am extremely sensitive to sound. Certain sounds can make me irrationally upset or angry but I can deal with it most of the time, especially when it comes to kids we foster. However, when I met Ted I quickly realised how often he has vocal stims which included short shrieks,muttering to himself and humming. He was a very sweet kid but it was very uncomfortable for me to be in the same room when he was stimming.My husband fell in love with him and wanted to start fostering him as soon as possible and he thought I was on the same page. He seemed shocked when I said I didn’t think it was the right fit. I explained that I couldn’t deal with the constant vocal stims. I can get very irritated when noises are bothering me and snap at whoever is causing them which would also be unfair on Ted. I don’t want him to feel like he has mask.My husband has hardly spoken to me since and I got a very angry phone call from his sister calling me an ableist. She told me autistic kids find it harder to find good reliable foster families and since we have all the resources needed, we should help him.AITA?",

My parents are separated and she's trying to move out.We have a computer that is shared amongst me and my brother that's in my dad's bedroom and we take turns throughout the week.Recently, I have been doing tutoring after school on my days on the computer, and it hasn't bothered me because I don't care. When I got home the other day, my brother was on the computer. I didn't care that he was using it, but I tell him nicely to get off. However, he told me that he made an agreement with our grandparent that we switched days on the computer. This angered me because the day before was his turn on the computer and that meant that I was losing one of my days. So, I told him how I felt about that and our argument escalated into a shouting match.After calming down a bit, I called up our grandparent to talk. They tell me that they did switch our days. They explained they did this to help me because then I would get more time on the computer. I said, \"I appreciate that,\" and I was going to explain what my problem was, when they suddenly interrupt me to say something before telling me to give my phone to my brother to talk. I handed it over. They told my brother in a condescending tone, \"Hop off the computer and give it to your brother, since he doesn't appreciate us trying to help him.\"This pissed me off. And this kind of thing was common for them and my father to do. The grandparent and my father have in the past, sent me over the edge because they constantly interrupt me during arguments while I am in the midst of explaining my pov. They did it during this phonecall and the fact that they do it all the time made me mad. I go over to where my phone was and began talking to them. We got into an argument where I shouted at them. By the end of the phone call, I had yelled at them, calling them a \"condescending asshole.\"Immediately afterwards, as I was upset, my father texts me to say that he was not pleased with how I spoke to them. So I called him so that I could explain myself. As I began talking, he interrupted me too, while I was in the middle of talking. He kept interrupting me. So I just hung up and went into my room.Fast forward a few hours, and I was in the car with my mother, driving around and doing errands. After a bit, I decide to text my grandparent to apologize but to also explain why I was so upset and that what they did was not appropriate. Maybe I will send screenshots, maybe not. However, the important part is what my grandparent replied with: \"Sorry. Won't happen again. You know what they say no good deed goes unpunished.\" essentially This pissed me off and my mom told me that she didn't like them because of how passive aggressive and nosy they were. So, in the moment, I decided to reply to their text with: \"I take back what I said, I'm not sorry.\"I'm just curious, AITA?",

I’ve consistently been having issues with my flatmates whether it’s about unannounced parties, loud noises and also mess. I’ve had to clean 3 times because of this. Today was where everything by all came crumbling.We have a cleaner that cleans once a week, and this cleaner only cleans if the kitchen is in an acceptable condition. Today, the cleaner refused to clean because people refused to wash up after themselves and I was extremely frustrated so decided to text the group chat stating that I will clean this one time but the next time this happens I will throw stuff out. The reason as to why I reacted like this is because we have received a third warning about getting a fine due to uncleanliness and due to the fact I live with people that are majorly better off than I am, they did not care as much as I did.I’d say I washed the majority of the plates but the things I saw out for a prolonged period I placed in a separate white plastic bag, also took pictures of how the kitchen looked before and after. I did not actually dispose of any of the dishes as I put in the chat that if this behaviour continues I will actually throw stuff out after a week so I was making a warning in a sense.My flatmates then went ahead and accused me of being out of the line and disrespectful and crossing boundaries- they also went on to say that I was causing issues in the flat (justifiably so because we were on the brink of being fined and it felt like no one cared except from me)Fast forward to a few hours later and I hear a lot of noise in the kitchen, lo and behold it’s my flatmates + additional friends talking crap about me. I walk in, sit down and say “well let’s talk then” and we talk, and of course it stirs into an argument, I get called a bitch and crazy simply because I was expressing my frustration for the fact people don’t clean. I stated that not everyone has the privilege of being able to be so careless  about receiving a fine and the main culprit that leaves their dishes out for extremely upset about me saying that and stated that she is not privileged (she’s an international student that comes from a well off family that pays for everything for her) and as she shouted at me I simply tried my best to not respond with cuss words. Ultimately I was made out to be an asshole in this entire exchange, everyone in the room treating me like I’m a horrible person for cleaning the kitchen, saying that I have no authority over them and that they can do whatever they want. (They are in breech of contract)A boy that was not living in my accommodation went a step further and started recording me with the aim of mocking me and giggling.

Bee and I have gotten pretty close since then, traveling together once a year. This included Elle up until two years ago.In 2022, Bee and I flew over to visit Elle (and her younger sister Mimi 28f + other friends in the area), who we were staying with. I'm also pretty close to Mimi but she isn't close to Bee. One night, we were all at Mimi and her girlfriend's place and decided to play pictionary while high. However, Elle was really tired and decided to dip out early. I thought Bee would be going back with her but she stayed despite not knowing Mimi and the gf long. This made me and our hosts pretty uncomfortable because she stuck to me all night and cracked jokes about how ugly our drawings were turning out. I don't think they were meant to be malicious but Mimi mentioned afterwards she definitely felt like Bee overstepped her boundaries bc they barely know each other. Before I go further let me say that Bee is a good person - like a REALLY good person. She's very empathetic, morally upstanding and always available to help when someone is in need.I usually love sarcastic shit eating humor but Bee started jokingly to give Elle's now husband crap for not knowing facts about his favorite movie right and also (jokingly) judged him for his taste in rock music bc she loves Kiss and he didn't. That was her brand of humor the entire trip. This can get a bit irritating at times even for me as she's critiqued me for my sleep schedule (I'm a freelancer) or my dedication if I don't want to catch up to a book/manga as fast as her.The next day we all went for dinner with Mimi and her gf, where Bee once again openly criticized the food for not being as good as where she's from. She said several times she was joking but Mimi ended up faking sick and leaving the restaurant because she was done. Since then, Elle has been speaking less to Bee, to which she has expressed her frustration to me. But Elle specifically asked me to keep quiet as she told me she wanted to have a heart to heart with Bee herself. Well...she got married and it hasn't happened yet.They're both adults so I figured I was a third party and I'd let them figure it out amongst themselves but after coming back from the wedding I feel complicit in some mean girls-esque you can't sit with us shit. Apparently, other friends have slowly disappeared like this from Bee's in the past so she has a huge affliction to it and gets completely defensive even when a friend wants to disconnect for themselves for a bit. At this point, I don't know if Elle will ever actually speak to Bee again. NGL I'm feeling pretty damn stupid for going to that wedding now.AITA?",

I have paid for, taken, and passed all the legally required hunter safety and firearm classes to be able to purchase my hunting license. I not only purchased my license but all the permits and tags I needed for my hunt. When my mom found out I had bought all my stuff she forbade me from hunting.Around Christmas I told my stepdad I was sad I couldn't go hunting and he said I should go because I worked hard to do it right and I was an adult. On Dec 30th I told my mom I was going to stay the with my bio dad's family with my dog for new years and she let me go. I spent the 30th with my bio dad's family, and then went hunting for 3 days. My stepdad and everyone on my bio dad's side knew where I was during my hunt.The problem is, someone on my bio dad's side posted a picture online saying \"good luck OP on your and [dog]'s first hunt!\" and my mom saw it.

On the positives I got an awesome new job with a significant pay bump, and completed a masters degree that I have been working on part time for the past few years. The low notes were that I hit a somewhat scary milestone birthday, and both of my parents were diagnosed with health conditions that will significantly impact their mobility and independence in the coming years. This has been a bit of a wake up call for me, and I've developed some anxiety about enjoying my health while I have it.It so happened that my birthday and completion of studies hit at about the same time, so I wanted to do something big-ish to celebrate. I love hiking so I wanted to finally do a multi-day hiking trip that I'd been considering for a while. When I decided on this trip, hubs was initially very annoyed about it, as it's not his type of thing. In general my husband is a bit of a work-a-holic, and most of our 'vacations' have been tacked onto his work trips (generally to nearby and uninteresting cities). He gets anxious if he is away from work for a while, and limited cell service is a no from him. I did offer to go alone (and pay for the trip from my personal savings), but eventually husband said he'd like to come, and we'd tack a bit of sight seeing on afterwards.After all was said and done, the trip was paid for partly from our joint account (which I contribute 50% to), and flights were paid from my personal savings.The trip ended up being mostly a success, however husband (as normal) took no interest in helping to plan, and left most of the booking and organisation to me. On my actual birthday he didn't organise anything (which I wasn't surprised about), but he also had scheduled two work meetings for that evening, meaning I spent my birthday in the hotel room with him on teams calls. When we got back he complained about the cost of the trip and demanded I send him more money from my savings account, which I did.The issue is, it is now husband's birthday and he's dropping lots of hints for big gifts that he wants. I spent about double what he did on me for Christmas presents, and have already bought him concert tickets, a cake and a picnic pack for his birthday party. When he drops these hints I remind him that he really put no effort into my birthday, but his position is that overall my birthday cost more and his effort was going on a trip he wasn't keen on.WIBTAH to stick to my guns and not buy the PS5 he's after?",

I just put up with it without comment.Then my sister Ruth moved back in with my parents. She uses marijuana medically for a chronic pain condition. She has been helping my parents to renovate their house and is doing a lot of improvements, as the house was falling into disrepair. Meanwhile the smell was growing. There were holidays and they gave us gifts. The wrapping had the smell. Then the gifts. I had another baby and moved into a new house. The clothes and toys they gave the baby reeked. Gifts left on the porch were so pungent that we always knew who they were from. I've visited a few times. It's looking nice, but I can smell the house from the street. When I return, I have to wash before my family will come near me.On Christmas Ruth made cookies. My brother Ron (m 38) immediately asked me if they were \"special\" cookies. No one wanted to eat them. Ruth then spent countless hours making macarons for my dad's retirement party. Ron and his wife both tasted the macarons and didn't want any more because of the herbal aftertaste.

I admitted that her cookies tasted like the house smells and she became infuriated, insulted me, and gave me a chance to take it back and admit I was lying. I told her that I can't stand to see all the hard work she's doing go to waste because of the smoke damage. She works so hard, is so thoughtful, and spends so much money on baking, gifts, and home renovations. Endless smoking indoors every single day for years on end is taking its toll on the house, and no matter how well she seems to clean it, the smell never leaves.She has stopped talking to me.

My friend came over to my place yesterday and \"confronted\" me asking why I unblocked him and i didn't pay her much attention as I was preparing for a meeting I had to host at my work, she was going on about it and at some point mentions that he doesn't even think I'm pretty and that I'm too short in height for anyone's liking and called me AH for unblocking him because I broke the \"friend code\" whatever.So, am I the AH for unblocking my friend's crush?PS : Been following this guy for a couple of months now, never spoke to him. I'm in no way interested in this guy. He left to a different country for pursuing his studies and probably in a relationship currently.My friend is talking to another guy now( who happens to be my friend and doesn't actually seem to like her back).",

I wish I didn’t, but I notice it all the time.All. The. Time.  I can’t seem to get past it.  At times it’s hard not to stare.

I always try not to show or control them, but this situation is hard for me. On the other hand, I cannot understand if my boyfriend doesn’t understand me or if he doesn’t want to understand. When I’m having a panic attack and it’s quite bad, he tells me something like “stop crying” or “Can you be normal?” and I tell him that’s not helping me. When I’m analysing him, it looks like he’s manipulating someone. Yesterday I came back from work and he asked me if I'd make him dinner, and I told him, “Please make yourself; I’m tired.” Then he went to the kitchen, and I could hear him saying, \"She cannot make me dinner because she is tired. What kind of relationship is that?\" Or he always tells me about gym girls who're beautiful because they go to the gym. (I'm not going to the gym, but I love dance, and that’s my hobby.) Okay, moving forward, I’m afraid of planes and flying. Two weeks ago, my boyfriend texted me and told me, “We are going on vacation with my family. I already bought tickets if you didn’t want to go with us. My sister didn’t want that you go, but if you don’t go, then we should break up.\" I don’t like the fact that I cannot choose if I want to go or not because he already bought tickets and his family does not want me there. Well, a few days ago, I started getting panic attacks. I cannot sleep or eat. I've been crying all those days, and I’m crying now. I talk to him a lot, but it looks like he has some limits because he listens to me and then his patience is over and he starts screaming at me. Today he came up to me and said, “Can you stop being so dramatic and childish?” After these words, I think something snapped in me. I cannot look at him the way I used to. I really do not want to go with them, and he’s threatening to break up with me. I told him that I'd pay my half, but I don’t want to go. So AITA for not wanting to go on the trip?",

He tells me early last week that his birthday is next wednesday (24th). I'm like ok awesome what do you have planned? He tells me a week long party. He then goes on to describe how as a kid his birthdays weren't special and no one celebrated him, so he makes up for it as an adult with lavish parties.Didnt have much of a problem with that and said we should plan a date as well. He wants to look at his schedule first to see when he has time.Friday, his friends pick him up and he goes to a bar, then an elegant steakhouse where he drunk texts me saying he's so wasted that he spilled wine all over himself (he said his friends were kinda embarrassed about it). Then heads to a comedy club/bar for a night cap.We talk when he gets home and he expresses that he's been thinking about getting sober, stopping drinking & smoking (weed). But then the next day we text and he's at a bar at around 1pm, ig he added that bc it wasn't on the schedule. And then he goes to another bar after with a different group of friends, comes home and says he's so tired of drinking and he's done and wants to be sober. But 30 min later, he claims his friends showed up and  told him he has no choice. So he goes to a lounge and drinks again. Then repeats his frustration and desire to be sober.He tells me the rest of his schedule: his parents had a dinner with him today. Monday he's going out to a bar and club I think. Tuesday & Wednesday he's heading out of state to a dispensary and then partying at a casino. He plans on gambling and go clubbing. Friday he's heading to a hookah lounge. Thursday he may go to another bar but says he's open if we want to go on a date.And that's when I just kinda get fed up. I confronted him about it last night, how he keeps saying he wants to get sober but keeps going to places where he uses and drinks. It wouldn't have bothered me so much if he hadn't said it 3x in the last few days, then immediately changed his mind. So I tell him that we should be friends because I can't do all the excessive partying and the back and forth about his sobriety. It confuses me, and it's more than I want to handle.He texts me and says I must be confused bc he doesn't party often, and this is an exception bc it's his \"birthday\" week. I'm not a party person, and as someone with a history of alcoholic partners and substance abuse, I don't want to be triggered.I dont want to party and club and stay out all night. It's not me anymore.AITAH for telling him this, and was I being inconsiderate saying his birthday week was excessive?*Tldr: new guy I'm dating has a week long birthday celebration filled with 2-3 bars a day, lounges, mushroom trips, out of town weed haul, gambling and clubbing, and comedy clubs. I confront him on the excessiveness of it and point out the back and forth frustration he expresses about wanting to be sober. I tell him we should just be friends.",

Very unfortunately, my mom noticed the sponge was missing during that time and got angry that I had spilled something. She went looking for what I had spilled, found the wet spot in my bedroom covers, and started getting extremely upset & frantic because it’s “going to mildew” and “you didn’t get all the soap out” and put every blanket and sheet in the washing machine bc of that. I told her I could just wash it out with more water and use a hairdryer to dry it, and asked her what she thought the washing machine does (rude ik) but she told me I didn’t get it. BTW we were both saying this very not calmly. So for the next hour she kept entering the rooms I was in to yell at me about it, saying I never learn from spills and act like I’m two years old, etc, and I just ignored her even though I was upset.A few hours later, I was sleeping and my mom woke me up wanting me to go to the other bedroom because she didn’t want me to leak on that bed and started yelling at me about that some more. So I went to the other bedroom and locked the door. 10 secs later she started banging on the door because she had laundry to dry and I decided not to open it because I was tired of her. I fully knew she would get very upset and that I was being petty.

So the day come, and I was up early waiting on ticket master website, and to my surprise, I got in, so I thought, I might as well just buy 2, and go with her, so I ended up buying 2 seat at the far end of the stadium, at the price of 180 each. And then I think, it was only 180 each, and her birthday is coming up in a few month, might as well just gift it to her as a birthday gift, so I told her such, she was very excited, and gave me the best BJ I ever had when she came back to Canada.Well, the issue comes when I started dating my current gf (lets call her PonPon) (who is also a fan of Taylor Swift), when I started seeing her, I decided that it would be weird to still go to Taylor's concert with my EX, so I just asked my EX if she know someone who want to go with her, and she said one of her friend really wanted to go but was not able to get a ticket, so I just told her she can have my ticket. I did not tell her about the ticket since I already gave it away and not have it anymore. Everything was fine until we meet up with our friend for New Year, and one of my friends just casually asked that \"now I am dating PonPon, what do I do with the Taylor Swift ticket?\" PonPon instantly asked me \"you have Taylor Swift ticket?\" I just said \"oh yeah, but it was for my ex and I, and when I started dating you, I just gave mine to her friend, because you know, it would be weird to still go when I am in a relationship with you.\" well, she did not take it well, and ask \"you could just aske her to give her ticket back, and we can go together\", I just said \" I am not taking back a birthday gift\". at this point, she was visibly annoyed and just said \"Then ask her to give your ticket back\", So I asked her \"do you want to sit next to my Ex?\" at this point she just blew up at me, saying I care more about my Ex, that she is my current gf so she should have the ticket, so I just told her \"I didn't even know you back when I gifted her ticket, so I am not asking for the ticket back, and that is final.\" Well, now she is telling me the relationship is not gonna work if I prioritize my ex over her, and want to break up, but I don't think I am prioritizing my ex over her since the whole thing was before I even met my gf, so AITA?",

I told her maybe it wasn't a good idea cause he might be with family since it was the holidays.She didn't care and texted him anyway.She would send him three paragraph long text messages and he would reply with one word. I tried telling her maybe she should text him at another time but she didn't listen.Few days pass and we're back at school.She had texted him again after he ignored her message.I couldn't just watch her embarrass herself anymore and I tried to find a way to nicely tell her to stop.I told Mary that Mike's probably being dry because he's with family and she should probably text him again another time.She just started saying how obviously into her Mike is and that he's playing hard to get.Then Mary tried telling me that I just didn't understand their relationship.Without even thinking I blurted out \"What relationship?\" Mary got absolutely furious and just walked out.I tried talking to her but she ignored me.I don't really regret saying it bc it was just the truth but I feel bad.I'm worried about her.But I'm also worried about Mike who can't set boundaries.I don't know what to do.",

A few months ago, he asked me to be his groomsman in his wedding in a few months, along with 5 other of his friends.For the first 10-15 years of our friendship, we were very close. Same school, studied the same things, same uni, almost identical career path, hung out a lot, went on trips, etc.For the last 2-3 years, our friendship has been the opposite. We hang out 3-4 times a year, usually when I initiate, and text every once in a while. This is in stark contrast to the other groomsman and other friends, who he sees a lot more regularly.I do admit our friendship has been up and down for a few years, but over the last few months I’ve tried to improve it. Asked him and his fiancée to go to an escape room, invited him to lunch, watch football games, etc. he has very rarely initiated and text me up to do something.I’m at the point where I don’t really feel close to him anymore. We’re certainly not at “groomsman” level , particularly in contrast with his other friends. AITAH if I tell him I’d like to attend as a guest?

Before anyone worried about covid we did not force anyone to come who was uncomfortable and restrictions were fairly lenient in my state by this time. We slightly rushed our wedding as my dad has several health issues and recently had a heart attack. I wanted to make sure he would be around to walk me down the aisle. Because of this, we didn't have much money for a wedding. It was less than $1500 counting my wedding dress and looked better than I could have imagined. We served homemade tacos for food and had water, juice, and soda to drink. We had our wedding in an art gallery so even hiring a bar and having people pay for the alcohol themselves was not an option as it was a small town gallery and had no built in bar. Most of the people in our families is Mormon so don't drink anyway. Therefore I didn't think no alcohol would be a problem. A few people brought their own and a friend even brought my husband and I some champagne to have which was appreciated. We didn't hear any complaints and assumed everything was fine. However, recently I have found out a ot of people were upset we didn't supply alcohol. A lot of people assumed I was pregnant and that was why. After learning I was not they were pretty upset and said I was an ass hole for making people bring their own. We never told anyone they had to bring their own and those who did chose to because they had asked if there would be any Alcohol. I do not believe I am an asshole for this but, after speaking with one relative who was very upset that I didn't have the audacity to say there wouldn't be any nor that they could bring their own I feel bad for not telling those who do enjoy drinking they could bring some.

My dad has lived with me before I ever even had kids and decided to move into our house when my fiancé and I moved 6 years ago. Now, preface to say, I know it’s not my dad’s responsibility to take care of my kids but this incident last night, I just feel like he could have done something to help out.I was in the living room with my 1 year old changing her diaper, my dad was in the kitchen standing next to my 5 year old. My son knocked over a whole cup of water all over the counter. I’m talking the entire counter was covered in water. Instead of doing literally anything, my dad’s just standing there. I ask him if he’s going to clean it up and he tells me he doesn’t know where any of the towels are and was going to have my son clean it up. Again, my dad has lived in the house as long as we have and the towels have never moved. They’ve always been in the same place. There’s also a brand new roll of paper towels sitting on the counter to the left of him. And my son is 5. I don’t trust him to clean up the entire thing.So I tell him to forget it and I’ll clean it up once I’m done changing hineys. I’m sooooo irritated at this point. Not just because of the water everywhere, but because we have a counter top ice maker and there’s literally water underneath it. My fiancé hears the commotion (he works from home) and comes to the kitchen with towels and we get it cleaned up. Meanwhile my dad just walks back to his room without even so much as attempting to help.AITA for being irritated over this? Again, I know it’s not my dad’s job to watch or take care of my kids.

This year we spent Christmas with my family at home so sent the gifts to my in-laws and again… no thanks.

Basically saying that she knows a guy who knows a guy who is an enforcer in a gang and can “make someone’s life really complicated”. Joy is a criminal lawyer so naturally she knows an amount of shady people.I talked to her about it because it seemed like she was bragging to intimidate a person she was talking to. I told her that I don’t want police officers coming into our house again. The whole arrest thing was very traumatizing because the police came to our house and took her away in handcuffs and performed a search.She instantly went defensive and said that she didn’t expect me to accuse her of something even the judge ruled out to be false and that it was an asshole move to listen on her conversation. I started apologizing, but she grabbed her keys and coat and left. She came back in the morning and apologized back saying that she overreacted. She is also being very affectionate with me now.

It was more sudden than expected.I just shared a few photos and a post with his name and birthday and death day. I honestly still do not have words to put behind how I really feel so I kept it simple. *** photos were of him as a college student, with the family, their 75 anniversary and him and me on my wedding day, not of him actively passing away****My aunt messaged me and said that “please do not post our private lives on social media it is very inappropriate and upsetting.”While I understand she is hurting, I don’t find anything wrong with sharing the post. I also had an uncle share a post about it and hour after it happened. So soon after that some of the grandchildren had not been informed. I waited 3 days.I told her “ This message is completely inappropriate.His death is not private. We don’t need to hide from it and it is not just a family matter. There is no shame in his life or death so why can’t it be talked about?Also. “”Uncle”” posted about it the day he passed away.This is part of how I am processing the immense loss I feel. You can process in your own way and I will in mine.”She then came up with “he wouldn’t want his picture posted, please understand this”.To which I replied “you are incorrect because I have shared photos of him before and showed him and showed him the comments and he did not care.”My grandfather also loved photography and shared photos often. While he did not understand social media, I think if he had understood it he would have just been sharing photos all the time. Not selfies, but everything else.So, hit me - AITA?I have considered taking the post down, but I also don’t want to, but I also did it too soon and kinda want it down because all the messages of condolences are too much too quickly.

I still don’t feel like I did anything inappropriate.its so bad right now that I went back to the original posts of the photos and took screenshots and a video of where my aunt interacted with the photos of my grandparents As proof that they had already been posted. If there was a privacy issue, why was I not asked to take them down then? oh wait, because it was a happy time. I guess we need to hide death now?I'm not a monster and I understand that seeing photos of him was triggering, but that does not mean I have done anything wrong and them both trying to hide behind a “privacy” issue when that’s not what this is about at all (because I have the proof) And trying to make me feel shame and bad is just not okay.",

However, 3 years ago he moved his gf (Y) n and it all went downhill. She is awful to me, always commenting on my face and weight, and caused me to get diagnosed with depression at the young age of 11. I went from the smiley, always talking kid to always being shut in my room because I’m scared to go downstairs because I know her or her kids will just dog on me until I’m in my room again.

He always treats the son like the child he always wanted, and treats me like I’m a burden. After we ate, Y went out with her friends so the rest of us went to the mall. I wanted to buy a shirt for an event I am going to, which is huge to me because I never leave my room. My dad kept pretending to not hear me ask, and even shoved me away from him so he could talk to B. I ended up taking my sister and us walking around by our selves. I bumped into my dad and he had bought many things from an expensive store for B. I asked him if I could get my shirt again, and he got so annoyed and walked past me. So you could imagine I wasn’t walking around with a smile on my face. He took my headphones away, but still wouldn’t talk to me, causing me to get even angrier. Now, when we got home, he finally l noticed how pissed I was. He asked what was wrong, but I said nothing. In the past anytime I tried to tell him that him or Y were hurting me, he would flip out and shut me out. He kept pushing and pushing but I still said nothing. He went into a huge speech about “I’m sorry that your unhappy with life” and “I wish I could make you feel better” and “you always seem angry” and I thought he was genuinely apologetic. But he ended it with “I hope you realize that what you’re doing isn’t ok”. So he asked once more what was wrong, and again I stayed silent. He got upset and started crying and sent me to my room.

A big thing about our new complex is that it is pet friendly. My roommate and I have discussed getting a dog, and now we finally had that opportunity.

Grizzly has spent the last few days acclimating to our apartment, and he's really fitting in.This is where the trouble starts. My roommate joined the apartment complex's Facebook group, and posted about adopting Grizzly. We then got a knock on our door about an hour after the post goes up, and it is a woman who is maybe in her late 30s. She tells us that Grizzly was actually her families dog, and they had surrendered him to the shelter because \"their daughter was misbehaving\", and now they wanted him back after they decided that she \"deserved him again\", and that they were \"so grateful that a nice girl kept him safe for her daughter\". My first reaction was to tell her no, and she got pretty pissed. About ten minutes after she left when I told her no, her husband and her both came to the door to yell my roommate for \"kidnapping their dog\". Eventually neighbors heard the commotion and things got awkward for everyone involved, but now they are relentlessly spamming the Facebook page about the \"dog thieves that live upstairs\".I don't feel bad at all for the parents. They seem like total assholes, but I do feel bad for their daughter. We haven't had Grizzly long, and I already feel attached, but I don't want for that little girl to see her dog loving someone else. Part of me wants to give him back for her sake, but the other worries for his safety with that family. My roommate is just as conflicted, and we aren't sure if we're the assholes for taking this girls dog away from her, even if her parents are trash bags. What do you guys think? AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA For not asking if my partner needed groceries?",
	"body" : "Small context: I (38M, autistic) live with my partner \"Ash\" (44NB) and my SIL \"Darcy\" (40F). My partner has joint custody of their daughter \"Kit\" (10F), and we have her 2 on, 2 off, and every other weekend.We're in the PNW so we've been snowed/iced in with the nasty winter storm, and we're all going a bit stir crazy- Ash and Darcy work from home, and school's been cancelled. With the schools closed and the roads iced over, Kit's been here all week, and unfortunately, her ADHD meds are at her dad's house. She's been bouncing off the walls, and driving us a bit nuts.There was a brief window where the roads were drivable, so I mentioned going out to grab a few groceries, but the snow behind our cars was frozen solid, and we couldn't break up the ice, so we dropped the subject.Now, every time I ever go to the store, I ask if they need anything, because I'm paranoid about being inconsiderate when it comes to getting groceries. Last time I did this, Ash said, almost annoyed: \"If I need something, I'll tell you.\"Not once during our talk did either of them mention that they NEEDED stuff- they weren't even going to go with me. So I ordered a bit of groceries from instacart using my money. It shows up, I put it away, and go to bed. (I have odd sleep hours due to health issues, so I grab sleep when I can.)A few hours into my sleep, Ash bursts into my room, all but yelling at me \"What the actual fuck. Why didn't you ask, you could have used my card, we're running low on milk and now we can't order anything now because it's an ice rink out there and no one will be driving, and what are we supposed to give Kit???\"I'm sleepy and confused as hell, but they just slam my door shut and storm off.Meanwhile, I'm freaked out by this, because it's VERY out of character for them. They don't yell, or slam doors normally.I didn't even REALIZE we were low on milk, because apparently, Darcy bought two half gallons of EGG NOG instead of milk, and now they're all \"We're low on milk\" even though we have plenty of Kit's favorite foods- fish sticks, stuff to make homemade pizza, ham/cheese sandwiches etc. She won't go hungry. Not only that, but Kit actually loves ice water more than any other beverage. She hasn't complained about food or drink, just that \"This snow sucks, I can't play in it.\"Meanwhile, I've actively been hiding in my room to avoid a confrontation because I honestly have no idea why Ash exploded at me. Part of me thinks they're just overwhelmed from everything going on, but I have no idea how to express that I didn't mean to be malicious, selfish or what have you.My autistic ass didn't hear \"We need this\" so I didn't bother, because the last time I asked, I was told not to ask......so AITA??(small edit to fix broken formatting)",

	"title" : "AITA for ruining my aunt’s birthday dinner?",
	"body" : "To be clear this happened over a year ago, but my aunt and my grandma are still not talking to me, which makes me think maybe I am the asshole here.My aunt was turning 60 and asked to have her birthday dinner at an expensive steakhouse. Nobody in my family is rich besides my dad and grandpa, neither of which were able to make it, but I still went, as well as my grandma, my cousin, my brother, and our significant others. My grandma was the only person who brought a present as joining my aunt for this expensive dinner was all we budgeted for her birthday.Throughout the meal, my grandma was checking out all the prices and ordered the cheapest options, meanwhile my aunt ordered the most expensive steak, asked for an added lobster tail ($50 itself) and ordered a dessert and a second meal to go. Essentially, she was set to eat for the week when it came to box up leftovers. She also ordered an alcoholic beverage even though she can’t medically drink alcohol, but took a few sips.When the check came, my grandma was in the bathroom. The server asked how to divide it and my aunt said to put her food on my grandma’s tab. She snickered and I guess the rest of us thought she was just playing a prank. But when my grandma got back and got her bill, she just about had a heart attack before she realized what happened, and told my aunt that she couldn’t afford it (for context, my grandma recently had to sell her house and get a job out of retirement because she is literally broke). My aunt argued, saying things like “Well don’t you have a credit card”, “If I was one of your dogs you would”, and “Well Dad would pay for it if he was here” (again, my grandpa is rich and definitely could afford it). My grandma just kept insisting she couldn’t afford it, getting more and more sad and ashamed.Finally I just put my credit card on the table and said “I’ll pay for it. Just shut up.” She then argued that I am her nephew and shouldn’t have to pay for her meal, but that her mom should because it’s her birthday. This also got my grandma to offer to put all the cash she had ($100) for the bill and my aunt payed the rest (over $150). My aunt further made comments that “She paid for her own birthday dinner” and how sad that was. My grandma’s food was $30 max. So she still paid for a significant portion.After that, my husband and I got the heck out of there. We hugged everyone except my aunt, and just left. I let my cousin know that we were no longer talking to her mom for now and didn’t invite her to either of our birthday celebrations. When my grandma found out she was pissed, as was my aunt who found out from my grandma.Since it has been almost two years, I have texted my grandma and aunt on their birthdays and holidays to no response. Which has got me thinking maybe I overreacted on my aunts birthday.So… am I the asshole?",

I’m halfway through my junior year and am applying for colleges. I work at Chick Fil A and I am part of a scholarship program with them. I play airsoft as a major hobby. My job lets me pay for my hobby and my own phone, along with my being able to pay for groceries from time to time. I love my parents, but since I turned 16 last year, they have been overstepping somewhat when it comes to my personal life and my privacy. They have recently been voicing their opinions that airsoft is “silly” and that I need to “get real” with my life. I reminded them that I get good grades, I pay for my own phone and my own hobby, and I even pay for food occasionally. About a week ago, I went on a camping trip over the weekend with some friends. We had a lot of fun, and I got back Sunday night to find that my parents had taken all my gear out of my room and thrown it away. I had spent more than $1,000 (about 919£) on my stuff, and it was all my own money. My parents hadn’t spent a cent on airsoft stuff since I was 13. I was so mad that I took by bike and rode to my grandmothers house a couple neighborhoods over. I have been staying with her for about 3 days. She is really pissed off at a mom. My parents have been texting me and calling me a lot, but I don’t want to respond. My grandmother told the rest of my family, and my cousins around my age are with me, but most of my aunts and uncles are siding with my parents.

	"title" : "AITA for Asking FIL to Tell Us When He is Coming Over",
	"body" : "Alright Reddit, so I (32m) just had this argument with my wife (31f), the relevant backstory is that my FIL just got back from over 6 months out of town. Before he left he parked his van at our house, and now that he’s back he is wanting to come get it. He NEVER tells us when he’s coming over, always just pops by. It’s frustrating because he often interrupts our plans for the day and now that we have a baby (0m), its rare that we are just chilling at home with nothing to do, we are pretty much always doing something.So FIL calls my wife, she misses the call and goes “he’s probably calling to figure out when he can pick the van up” so we discuss and decide that we will walk the dog then go pick him up to get his van. Literally 5 minutes after calling (he lives 20 minutes away) he is knocking on the door. I was annoyed because we were trying to do other stuff. When he comes in I say hi, then go “man it’s a good thing we were here, you gotta give us more of a heads up when you’re coming over” he says “well I tried calling but she didn’t answer” and I said “yea you were already on your way though right? What about letting us know before you’re on your way” the whole exchange it was pretty clear he didn’t think he did anything wrong and he didn’t seem offended by my comment. We got the van sorted and (I thought) everything was fine.Now wife is PISSED at me because she says my “jab” was too direct. She says it was her first time seeing her dad in 6 months and I basically said “why tf are you here.” I just know my wife isn’t ever going to say anything, so even though I don’t think he will ever respect boundaries, I think someone still needs to communicate the boundaries with him. I told her that her lack of communication with her dad is going to blow up in our faces eventually, and I’m just trying to protect us from that. He loves just stopping by and my wife doesn’t wanna tell him that his ex wife (messy divorce) is our babysitter for the time being and says if he comes over while she’s here then oh well. But that’s still going to be my wife’s problem when it happens, and she isn’t going to be thinking “oh well” when it does. Shouldn’t she at least try to communicate with him before the shit show occurs? You gotta participate in your own rescue right? I realize my comment was direct, but anything less than a direct statement will be ignored, actually even my direct statement was ignored.I know parent relationships are complex, and generally I let her make the calls with her parents and I take lead with mine, but this is going to be a true issue going forward and I really think I’m just trying to nip it in the bud. FWIW, no other parent just comes by without telling us ahead of time.AITA?Edit: I’ll accept I’m TA here. For the record though, yea he’s been gone 6 months but for the other 4.5 years we’ve been living here it is a weekly occurrence. It bothers my wife but she doesn’t say anything, that’s why I thought I should. I’m not on some power trip lol",

	"body" : "Okay so I F(26) and my husband M(25) are having our first child this year in a few months and we're supper excited. I've expressed to him that with the rise in RSV cases I'm extremely uncomfortable with anyone outside of our home kissing our baby girl once we bring her home. We only live near my in-laws, who i genuinely love, so I didnt think it be hard to set boundaries. Now with that's said we've come to a disagreement with the new baby on the way.Well last night my MIL sends me a video about the new RSV shot that's being given to pregnant women to help combat RSV for infants. I said on top of getting the shot we had decided that we didn't want anyone kissing our daughter for the first couple months as just another precaution. Now I'll admit my husband had not officially sided with me on this topic yet and I know I was wrong for making it an us thing but at the time I felt it best to try to seem united on it. My MIL then messaged me saying that people are going to kiss her, especially family and there's no way she's going to not kiss her. If she had just said she doesn't understand why I would hold them to that or would like to talk about it and maybe ease my concerns I wouldn't have been so mad off the bat but she told me that I had no choice in how this was going down with my child and it's not the first time she's done this since I got pregnant.My MIL called my husband after I didn't respond to her texts and was then getting into us about how she's raised three boys and that my concerns as a first time mom are just overdramatic and I can't put her in a bubble for about 45 minutes. She said how I'm going to have to just learn to be more comfortable with things that make me uncomfortable and that she was put in her place many of times when she had my husband,her first child. I said this was not something I was willing to budge on and that right now were just going to disagree because I had given my family the same rules about their trip when they come to visit and they all agreed and understood. She did not care.Once off the phone my husband and I ended up in an argument because I was extremely hurt by how she had claimed what I was trying to do was hurtful to her and that if I tried to play games and keep the baby from them I was wrong. He was annoyed because he doesn't see why it's that big of a deal to let them kiss her since they both work from home. I told him if it was just them in the house I would honestly be fine with it but they have his brothers16 and 21 who are both in and out of the house for various reasons. He feels like I'm making an issue with hsi family for no reason. Later we both apologized for getting so mad at each other before I explained my feelings of being disrespected, and said that was where my main issue came in and he just kind of nodded it off. I just don't know how to feel at this point and I feel cornered.So am I the asshole?",

	"body" : "I (18f) am i guess refusing to work with my mom in her new store during my gap year.So a bit of background, my parents are divorced, I live with my mom and we've always struggled with money. A year ago she and my stepdad decided to open a store. This sadly left my mom unemployed and mostly helping and relying on my step dad for the entire year, before they actually opened.About 3 months before them opening I was helping out whenever I could and it went unpaid. My mom told me that after the store actually opened I would start getting paid. So after they opened, I worked for about 3 weeks before my mom told me that she simply couldn't afford to have me as an employee.Side note my parents have pretty much moved out of their own house because they're at the store so often and I'm essentially living on my own now.The following Monday after pretty much getting fired, I had an accident and broke my leg. Now I was already planning on finding a different job, me breaking my leg essentially ruined all of those plans. I have a small babysitting job which also went out the window because I can't take care of a kid like this. I'm also currently waiting to find out if I need surgery or not.Right after me breaking my leg my boyfriend came over and pretty much helped kind of take care of me. During this he took me to the grocery store and I quickly realized I was spending most the of money that I had. (I was broke from the holidays and my mom hadn't paid me my full paycheck from the last week) So I called my mom and asked if she could pay for the groceries since I wasn't going to be able to be making any money for a while and it's not like I moved out on purpose.At hearing this request my mom got pretty upset and called me selfish and just a whole bunch of other things, how when she was a teenager she had to go get a job and support her parents and I haven't done that, and now that I'm 18 I should be able to support myself and do things on my own.She also said that she initially expected me to be working at the store for free the first couple months up until the store got popular then I would start getting paid.I understand all of this, I just don't really have a way to make money right now, as an injured high school graduate with no real experience.The store in general has caused more fights between us. She's been unnecessary rude when I made mistake or when I was 10 minutes late on my first day. Honestly it's just really made me miss the way that she used to be with me. I feel like now I don't do anything but disappoint her and I just don't want to be a bad daughter but I don't really see what I'm doing wrong here.",

She is on drugs and had bpd that she refuses to undergo treatment for.Over the years there has been a repeating pattern of her being super nice to husband and I for a few months and then switching and being extremely hostile and nasty.The last 2 years she has really had it out for me. I work in the adult entertainment industry. My husband and I both discussed this career choice and he is comfortable with the work I do( for reference it’s stripping and online content). I don’t actually have sexual relations with anyone. Well SIL is not happy about this and has called me a slut and whore and had said I bring shame to the family numerous times. I don’t really care about that and still always made an effort to at least be civil. The real kicker is that on Christmas Day we announced we are expecting our first child after 6 years of infertility I got pregnant naturally. Obviously we are so happy and excited but when my husband told her the news she said I’m so sorry! He was like what no congratulations? and she was like I can’t say that all I can say is I’m sorry.She then proceeded to attack me saying I am the reason she doesn’t get to see her brother and that I stop him from talking to the family and that I’m the reason he struggles with his mental health( he recently had a severe mental health crisis but is doing better now) . Which isn’t true at all, if anything I encourage him to see his family more because he is pretty anti social and a house hermit that prefers to stay home. Then husband tells me that she told him he should get a paternity test since I’m such a slut and it’s mighty convenient that I finally got pregnant. He has called her out numerous times on her behaviour but it doesn’t stop her.Husband still tries to be friendly with her as that it’s what his dad wanted and his dad passed away 2 years ago so for the sake of respecting his dads wishes he still tries to have a good relationship with her. I however am done at this point and refuse to speak to her or even acknowledge her presence when we visit his mum. Now his mum is saying I should be more forgiving and let it go that she has said so much nasty things about me because lately( the last month) she has been really good and stable and it’s not her fault she treats people like this because she has a mental illness. I disagree because like I said she can be really nice for a period of time but it never lasts and in the next couple of weeks or months I know she will be back to her usual antics and I honestly just hate her at this point.Husband respects my views and understands why I feel the way I do but I get the impression he also thinks I should just let it go and forgive her.

Then at about 18 she tried coming back into my life and my cousins tried to guilt trip me into caring for her and giving her money (I had just started working and had like $200 and no car) and when I refused to speak to her (because I was trying to get my life together and also wtf) it ended up tearing my family apart so the aunts/uncles/cousins on “her side” hated me and stopped talking to me.Now I’m almost 30 and she’s sick in the hospital on a ventilator and my cousins are reaching out to me again.Literally as of about a year ago I finally started to build my life and go to school, “graduate” from therapy, get off anxiety medication, become a personal trainer to help others feel good about themselves intrinsically, have a stable and healthy relationship, set healthy boundaries, and feel confident and focused about what I want for myself and the ones who have helped and supported me to get to this point, and actually started to think of having a family of my own.AITA for being annoyed and not wanting to even be bothered????",

I was up at 5am this morning to do 5 hours of prep to make sure the food was fresh and ready to go. The whole house was themed racing, I organised everything on my own with nearly zero assistance from my husband - all he had to do was unfold the bouncy castle and plug it in.I had made it clear to both my husband and his family that the 10am-12pm party was alcohol free. After all the formalities were over at 12 I said I didn’t mind if they cracked a beer but I wanted the party to stay focused on the kids, and didn’t want the mums to get stuck looking after and entertaining the kids while the men drank in the garage.An hour into the party I realised half the men were gone. They’d snuck into the garage to drink. My father in law was leading the charge. I reiterated that I didn’t want drinking, he told me to leave him be since he was an adult, I told him “if drinking is that important to you take your beer and fu*k off out of my house, you don’t get to disrespect me in my own home, that’s not on” and walked away back to the party.I feel bad that I yelled at him but I feel like my request really wasn’t that hard a request to accept. My husband (who I’m still not certain wasn’t the one gathering more people to go into the garage) thinks ITA and need to apologise. So AITA?",

We live in Minnesota and ever since it’s gotten below freezing they have been idling their trucks off and on throughout the day.   Our living room is very close to their driveway.  When sitting in the corner on the couch I am probably 20 feet away from their trucks.   We have bought a soundbar to help with hearing the TV but the constant rumble seems to give me anxiety over time.I understand idling to warm up but as of right now, one of the trucks has been idling for a 1.5 hours.  I have no idea why someone would need to warm their truck up for that long.  There are times they do this and they don’t end up going anywhere.  They also sometimes use remote starts and restart their trucks every 15 mins or whenever the timer is up.   I would have no issue with them warming up for 10-15 mins and leaving.I want to say something but my husband doesn’t.  He also warms his car up in the morning (starts warming up at 6:50 and leaves at 7:10) and also warms up after his lunch break, but that’s nothing compared to how much the neighbors idle their trucks.   We haven’t met them yet (they moved in last month and we kinda keep to ourselves), and I’m worried about kicking off our neighbor relationship on a negative note.   I do have a landlord I could go to (we live in an area with 11 townhomes and he owns most of them) and I’m assuming he would keep the complaint anonymous but not sure if this is something to bother him over.",

Unclean conditions, not seeing a vet, unsocialized (even kept apart from each other) etc. Due to health issues the Uncle has moved into an apartment for his care and the animals remained in his house with neighbors/family friends checking in on them occasionally. This has not worked out.We live  an hour away and while  in the area she checked on the pets and was taken aback by the conditions. We're both huge animal lovers (4 cats and 3 dogs ourselves) and she didn't feel like she could leave them like that. Adding to this, the cold our area is experiencing caused the temp in the house to be far too low. I was at work when she called to get my thoughts on what she should do. I recommended she contact local rescue and humane society type organizations. She alluded to maybe bringing them to our place and I said I didn't think that was a good idea, as we barely have space for the animals we have, setting up 3 other spots for these to have their own space just isn't feasible. I could tell this wasn't the response she was hoping for, she got very snippy with me and hung up without even saying goodbye.About 4 hours later she is texting me about something else and slips in \"sorry in advance, but I went ahead and brought the 2 cats to our house, one is in the office, one is in the downstairs bathroom. FYI the office cat may scratch\" (paraphrased). I was pretty annoyed at this point, having 2 rooms of the house now mostly inaccessible and extra litter boxes around etc., but what I was most upset about was how she went about doing it. Hanging up on me when she didn't like my answer and doing it anyway, not telling me until after it was done.Now the part where I might be the AH. After being told there were +2  cats in the house (hopefully temporarily, she said she would try to find them new homes ASAP) I was annoyed  and my replies for the rest of the night were very terse. I finished my shift, came home and basically went straight to bed. She tried to talk to me about it, but I was tired, had a headache and didn't feel up to having an argument. This morning she left 3 hours before I did and as I was getting ready for work she texted me asking me if I would mind feeding the cat in the bathroom. In this same convo she was asking me to reach out to an acquaintance who trains working dogs (think police k9) to see if he wants her uncle's  pitt-bull. I told her I didnt think that would be a good fit and I wasn't comfortable asking him, considering I haven't spoken to him in 8 months. I replied that I would mind and did not want to feed the cat. She replied with a very sarcastic \"thanks for the help.\" I feel like she took on this responsibility against my advice and wishes and I am justified in not helping with their care. I replied \"thanks for the sarcasm\". This was 3 hours ago and we haven't spoken since. AITA?",

Then this week whilst me and one of them are out the others start looking at places to go and flight prices. Me and the friend I was with found it cool cause we were just talking bout it. Few days pass and I get pulled to the side by that friend saying ‘I’m gonna be upfront a groupchat was made with 8 of us called ‘gyals trip’ and you aren’t in it and we’ve been looking and planning on going away for a week over summer  I’m shocked like actually hurt by this and one of the reasons I was told I wasn’t invited got me confused. Context I’m a gay man and have been friends with them all for like 5/6 years now, the reason I wasn’t invited is bc they wanna wear bikinis in the pool and walk around in their pants without it being awkward. I’ve seen almost them all in the equivalent before and it’s never been an issue prior but I respect their opinions it and said ‘ok that’s chill I mean I’ve wanted to go away as a group for ages so if that’s the issue myself and maybe other men in the group who weren’t invited could get a place together nearby that way we’re still on holiday together’. My response was a maybe I’m unsure tho.  So in short my closet friends for 5/6 years basically are planning on going away without me despite me suggesting and saying we should do it for over a year.   AITA if I’m visibly mad or upset.

My sister enjoys GS and has made multiple friends after being an anti-social, shy kid.I am proud of my sister but have no personal interest in Girl Scouts. My mom on the other hand, for the past year my sister has been doing it, has been distinctly hinting towards me to join GS. I have expressed numerous times that I have zero interest in joining.Her hinting and asking went on for numerous months until (12/13/23) when I was at a Girl Scout event with my sister and my mother asked me. It was like the straw that broke the camels back because I got tired of her hinting and asking. I finally joined Girl Scouts.I found out since I joined GS at my sister's troop's event I got put into her troop. I'm in an elementary school troop with kids that are over 4 years younger than me when I'm about to be in high school. My mom was so excited and wouldn't stop talking about it and would brag to family members that I joined it.A month later I went to my first GS meeting and I wasn't having a very good day already so I was overwhelmed with my school day + finding out I'm in a troop with little kids. I ended up having a mental breakdown at the meeting and my mom told me to sit out and eventually come back into the meeting because it was \"too important to miss\". The entire meeting was the troop leader telling the parents how cookie season was going to go while the kids ran around the room playing for an hour.A couple days ago my mom was cutting out door hangers about cookie season. She kept asking me to make an account on a girl scout website and kept talking and talking about GS and how my sister and I would have to go put the door hangers on around our neighborhood (in winter? be so fr) and I didn't care.When I first joined GS I expressed interest but when she was consistently bugging me I finally told her that I have no interest in GS and only joined because she wouldn't stop bugging me even after I expressed how I felt about it. She began to say how we never bond and since she was doing it with my sister she thought we could bond that way.My sister and mom don't bond over much but GS and my mom and I have tons of shows we watch together. That made me feel like I was taking my sisters thing. So I expressed that to my mom and she got mad at me. Saying I never want to watch those shows anymore and never want anything to do with her and my \"angsty teen shit\" was getting old but anytime I bring up something other than GS we could bond on she says she tired or that's boring or she brushes it off and continues to talk about GS.She's making me stay in GS until the end of the school year and I have to go to meetings and sell cookies.

After a month with no payments, I asked them when they would start paying me back and they ignored my messages, despite still being active online and posting on social media.  When I told them that I felt like they were avoiding paying me back because it was clear that they were choosing to be on their phone, posting online, and reading my messages about the money but not replying to me, they accused me of being “overly entitled to their time, in violation of their boundaries, and demanding to access to them.”  I find this confusing logic, considering that he responded to messages that I’d sent that were NOT about the money. Since then, he has been super defensive towards me.  He’s also posted several passive aggressive articles and Instagram stories about boundaries and thanking those who “allowed him the courtesy of time and space and didn’t demand access to him.”  I was raised to believe that if someone loans you money, you should 1) never put them in a position where they have to chase you down for it or remind you to pay them back, and 2) be gracious and NEVER get defensive or get an attitude with them if the subject comes up.

	"title" : "AITA- Calling out friends ex for behaviour after separation",
	"body" : "My partner and I got caught in a difficult position when friends (Mike and Jessica) separated a few months ago. We were trying to be there for both of them, as she was particularly distraught, moving out and struggling with mental health not being in a stable family unit anymore (wasn't like that at all prior to the break up).My husband was routinely going to the gym with Mike and hanging out afterwards. Hubby was coming back from these meetings not wanting to talk to me which was creating tension in our relationship, then would eventually blurt out stories of his buddy's new multiple exploits from Tinder, including details of hook ups that were occurring while I was socialising with his ex Jessica who thought Mike was out with another mutual friend (Jake). Mike and Jessica were still working out childcare arrangements for their kids at this point and Jessica was looking after the kids while Mike was going out for these dates/hook ups.Jake the mutual friend was also calling up my husband and for lack of a better description was gossiping about the situation, glorying in Mike's exploits somewhat (which included one of his friends)  Jake was calling my husband occasionally in my presence not knowing I was there (while driving and phone was on speaker) and at the end of one call said not to tell me to my husband which made me feel pretty uncomfortable. I was feeling really anxious trying to be there for my friend but knowing that her ex was doing what they were doing, sometimes while we were catching up. I couldn't tell her for fear of her mental health, and it wasn't my place, but it was placing a burden on me I felt really uncomfortable with, and anxious that if Jessica found out that I knew it would make matters worse, for our friendship and her mental health.Anyway things came to a head about a month ago when Mike confronted my husband at our house while I was cooking dinner after I ignored him at the gym earlier that day (by this point I couldn't even stand looking at him). I told him I was finding it really difficult knowing about all his new partners while trying to be there for Jessica and it was a burden on my conscience. He didn't get it at all and was flummoxed by my concerns. I said I felt guilty about it, like I was lying to Jessica knowing about it and wished he would tell her. That I felt annoyed it was expected my husband keep secrets from me and that it was causing problems for our communication. He said it was none of her business, which I kind of understand, but my problem was that we were getting caught in the middle. I asked him if he felt any guilt, to which he took great offense and left.Moving forward a month they've both ghosted us. We both still feel sick about the whole thing, but honestly are glad to be out of the whole shit show. Am I the Asshole?EDIT/ADD- Couple of people asking for more details- there is a 3000 character limit on the initial post so was a lot I couldn't include.They had been going to counselling for a while but if there was any trigger for the separation it is that he is about to get a big lump sum from a relative. He'll be able to live mortgage free while she won't be able to afford a house with her leftover capital after financial separation.He had been badmouthing her to anyone that listened. A friend mentioned at a dinner party where neither were present that he'd been making comments that their kids were happier without her around (not true by the way and ignores the fact their youngest was routinely crying whenever they were doing child handover), that she was stalking him (while he had an app on his phone tracking her, she did not) and that she was entirely responsible for the break up.Her mental health has been bad enough for her to mention it to me and my husband (no S word allowed here...) He said she was playing the victim card.Happy to embrace the asshole tag, but it should be worth noting that he came over to my house to complain to my husband that I wasn't interested in having anything to do with him anymore. So I might be an asshole in this situation sure, but I think personally he's an asshole that I don't want around me or my teenage sons or daughter, and I'm glad he's spending less time with my husband while he's hooking up with free abandon and relaying his exploits with glee while his ex and co parent is in pieces trying to build their new life.",

My stepmom and I split the bills 50/50 but buy our own groceries.My stepmom has been in my life since I was 8 (my mom passed when I was 3). She is OK but rather old-fashioned. She is very strict on how boys and girls shouldn’t be too close (no, she is not religious; this is more of her personal values). Carrie is very sheltered and has never been to any sleepover when there was a boy involved or participated in any traditionally boy-dominated activity. All her life Carrie’s doctor has been one of her female distant cousins on my stepmom’s side as my stepmom feels uneasy with her daughter having a male doctor.Carrie’s a sweet kid and although we’re not close because of our age gap we do love each other. My stepmom, fortunately, has never tried to restrict what I do. My mom’s family is very liberal and are active in my life.I have a boyfriend Matt (25m) who’s in med school. Several days ago my stepmom asked me to watch Carrie while she visited a friend and I said OK. My boyfriend on his rare down time stopped by to hang out and we just chilled and had snacks in the living room.Carrie came to us and asked to talk about her period. I asked her if she would like to only talk to me but she said she didn’t mind. I then explained all I knew but when she asked the more medical info I kinda turned to Matt and he stepped in and helped. Carrie actually asked a lot of questions that required Matt’s med school knowledge like hormones, how they will affect her growth, what symptoms she should watch out for, those kinds of things. She even asked about birth controls and STDs and again Matt really helped with the explanation. We searched for videos on the internet to help explain a few issues as well. In all, Matt and I thought it was an excellent afternoon. Carrie was more informed and confident by the end of it.Later, my stepmom learned that Matt gave Carrie “the talk” and she blew up. She said she didn’t doubt Matt’s knowledge but it was wildly inappropriate for me to let Carrie talk about this topic with a man when I know how she felt. She said a man, no matter his credentials, doesn’t deserve to know her daughter’s most private info like that. She said she planned to have Carrie’s doctor give her the talk anyway. I said it was fine and I was also there but she simply said she’s Carrie’s mother and next time I plan to do something like this I need to inform her first and she will decide if Carrie can take part in it or not.I mean, she IS Carrie’s mother so I wonder if I overstepped and should have told Carrie to wait to ask her mom instead?

Parking in lots near my building so I have a short walk, but also not associated with my building would be the safest option, which is what I have been doing.I have lived in this condo complex for over 5 years.

I had to walked past his car to get to my building. When I walked past he was still screaming at me. I did not engage.

We ended up becoming close friends, and over the years we would have trips, bail each other out of difficult life/health situations, and ultimately become quite tight.Unfortunately, they moved to a different region in my country. I kept in touch with them over the years and continued to visit and stay with them when I needed a getaway, on their offer.A little over two months ago, I had an opportunity with funds, scheduling, and training to attend a footrace in their region. I reached out to Bill, letting him know I'd be around. Bill mentions he has important functions that weekend with others to host, and will be unable to host me. No issue, I already booked a hotel because I wasn't already invited like that.So. The big weekend comes, I fly, pick up my rental and get to the hotel. \"I've made it to [City] safely!\" Crickets. NBD, I knew they had other things on their agenda. Three days pass. \"What's with this weather here? Just finished that marathon!\" Bill responded, \"you brought the cold weather with you. Lol.\" That's our typical joke. I asked Bill, \"how was your weekend?\" Crickets.The following night, I went to a restaurant I'd enjoyed when I stayed with them prior. It was about 1km from their house. I shoot a message, \"Closer to your neck of the woods, I’m hoping to hit up [Restaurant] if they’re open tonight. waving hello\" Still, no response.Two nights after the restaurant message – I tell Bill I had fun in their city and while we couldn't meet up, I hope the weekend was good to them too [with their events and guest].Today Bill messages me, \"we’re kind of floored that you could be less than a mile from my house and you didn’t even make an effort to stop by for five minutes.\" ... ”If they are a friend they are a priority.\" - I take this to mean they would have made time for me, yet – \"we would’ve expected that you would’ve said hey I’m a mile from your house.\" Bill went on to say that Frank was upset too, yet I cannot say for certain that Frank knows anything other than what Bill told him. My last message to him today read, \"my message history shows no response to my text [from that night].”I was able to make connections with other friends when in this region during this trip. Neither Bill nor Frank reached out to me that weekend to ask how the race was or how I was, I figured they were rather tight in scheduling, hence the ghosting. Now I feel upset that I upset him, and I've been beating myself up for it. Should I have just stopped by unannounced like that? I feel that would've been rude.Reddit.

	"title" : "AITA for not wanting to pay my mother rent",
	"body" : "So basically, I (F18) have been debating moving out of my mothers (F58) house since the moment I started paying rent. It's not that I dont love my mom or think that I shouldnt pay her rent but I think its not justified if I do. What I mean by that is that my brother (M20) doesnt pay her rent at all. He used to pay rent after he got out of highschool but got paid a little more than I did. He got paid $16 while I get paid $14. Each pay check my mom took $150 out of his paycheck for rent since he got paid weekly, but since I get paid Biweekly it always seems to be a bigger amount for me since I have to give $300 (Edit: I pay $600 to $900 a month) but at the same time he got paid more than me so the rent is a more significant amount. But anyways, back to why I dont want to pay rent at all or at least a lot less.I'm barely at the house, I work 2-11 while I stay at my boyfriends house usually on my off days and after I get off from work. I dont eat anything I dont buy, mostly because on my lunch break I just go out to eat and I dont eat breakfast or lunch at my own house. Nevertheless, my brother, may I remind you again who is 20 years old, has no job and just plays video games all day. He hasnt had a job since he got fired from his old one which has been about a year and a half. My mother babies him and whenever I bring up that he should get a job she shuts me down and tells me that he doesnt have to because hes ashamed of how much he weighs. Yes, my brother is a pretty hefty guy but its not so much where he couldnt work. Ive offered to get him a job where I work but everytime he says \"I dont want to work yet\". So while I'm working 8 hours almost everyday to get money that i wanted to save up for to get a car and now almost half of it is going to rent, my brother gets spoiled by my mother without having to pay rent. She bought him his own car, pays for his food, pays for his gas, is paying $10,000 for a weight loss surgery for him, and so much more while now what he uses for free (plus more) I'm having to pay for my own for which I barely use. I've been saving to get a car and move out since I've gotten this job but the amount of money my mom wants me to pay each month has put a damper on how much I can save since I also pay for my food + other necessities.

I thought I could sell it online for more money however my close friend from back home is always complaining about how some tops don't go down to her size in stores and everything is usually too big so I called her and asked her if she wanted it and I would post it to her and she could send me the money since it was such a nice dress. She said yes and said thank you!!This brings me to the issue, when I stayed at her house while I was home for the holidays just passed, I left some workout clothes at her house by accident. She told me and I asked her to post them to me as I don't have many pairs of gym clothes (and they also double as pjs) and she said she would but it's been 3 weeks and finally this week she told me it was \"a lot of effort haha\" which kinda annoyed me since I would have done it for her.I decided to put the dress up online instead of waiting for her to send me money which she saw and asked if I was selling the dress. I said yes and told her she could buy it from me for the new price ($50). She asked why $50 instead of $15 and I said I'll get more money out of it and then immediately asked her if she had sent me my clothes yet.She didn't reply to my message for a few days, (we usually talk here and there every day over text) and still hasn't sent me my clothes. I heard from my boyfriend who is friends with her boyfriend that I had been \"kinda rude\" to her? My bf told me that her bf had called me an asshole for trying to sell the dress without telling her. (she hadn't sent me any money yet and I would've sent it back if I planned on selling it for more) And it kinda rubbed me the wrong way that a trip to the post office was too much effort for her which it isn't.

My BIL thought everything should go to him since he was closest with the uncle but the estate attorney disagreed and everything was split between the siblings of the uncle. We ended up buying a sports car from the estate for a little under marker value because no one else wanted it or had the means to purchase it. We only agreed after BIL asked us to buy it so it wouldn't be gone to some stranger. It's been several years and the car isn't really a good fit for our family since my husband now has a long commute to work and insurance costs in my area have doubled in 2 years. Did I mention the car takes premium gas and gets about 13 mpg? We bought a model 3 to make my husband's commute easier but now we have this other car taking up garage space and costing 200 a month for insurance and depreciating in value. When we asked BIL if he's going to buy it from us soon he said it would be 5 more years when he has his other car paid off. We told him we want to sell it because it's just not practical for us and now he's throwing a tantrum. He could sell his car and buy the car from us but he won't do that. He makes a good amount from his job but he's not responsible with money at all and recently. He just bought a $5000 golf cart a few weeks ago. We also said we'd sell it for what we paid for it since we didn't put many miles on it and we could sell for a lot more to a private party. Of course he wants a steep discount as well. I understand he's grieving for his uncle but his mom already bought the other sports car from the estate and is holding it for him at her house. We'd also be willing to sell to him for a good price and he's had over 2 years to save up or could take a loan. We could really use the cash from the car since cost of living has gone up for us significantly the last 2 years.TLDR: Are we in the wrong for wanting to sell our car and not hold it for my BIL?",

This became a regular occurrence, and even though we accepted it, it created frustration.The tipping point happened during her birthday celebration when my friend invited me to come and watch UFC.

	"body" : "I (23F) and my friend Tia (21F) have planned a 10 day road trip to another state (about six hours away) in 3 weeks. I asked Tia last year if she wanted to go on this trip with me, she said yes as long as her school schedule wasn't too busy; I asked her once school started again if she thought her school schedule would allow her to take the trip; she said yes but she would have to figure out someone to look after her cat while she's away. This hasn't been a problem for her before, so I figured she was good to go and I booked the trip, including about $2000 for a non-refundable hotel room and non-refundable city passes (about $200 each).Even though Tia has had a lot of notice about the trip, she still hasn't found someone to look after her cat. The two friends she would normally ask aren't able to watch him this time. I asked her if she had other friends to reach out to, and she said yes but that she hasn't done so yet. I also said I could ask some of my own friends if they could help, but she said she'd rather the cat stay with someone he knows.I suggested a pet sitting service that would come to her home and either check in on the cat every day or stay overnight for the duration of the trip, and I told her I would send her the money she needs to pay the pet sitter. I also suggested she could introduce the cat to the pet sitter in advance of the trip so she can make sure the cat is comfortable, and that she can ask the pet sitter to send her pictures of the cat and the litter box/food each day, or she could install a camera so she could watch the cat from her phone and make sure he's okay. She also has roommates who aren't big fans of the cat but could be present in an emergency; it's not like the cat would be left completely alone for 10 days.The closer our trip gets, the more anxious I'm getting about the lack of action she's taking to get the cat looked after. I obviously don't want the cat to be left alone or in an unsafe situation, and I think if she wants a pet sitter to come for 10 days in 3 weeks, she's going to need to book that pretty soon, especially if she wants the cat to meet the pet sitter in advance. I've been really looking forward to this trip and I don't want the money I've already spent to go to waste, and I also really want to go on this trip with her; I don't want to go by myself or have to try to find someone else to come with me.I think I've been putting some pressure on her about getting the cat looked after; I've asked her a couple of times in the past week whether she's taken any more steps to get it sorted, and I've reminded her how excited I am to go on this trip with her and how she's my favourite person to travel with. Her response has been she's still thinking about what to do with the cat, she wants to go on the trip with me, but I have to prepare for the possibility that she might not be able to figure things out for the cat and might not be able to come.AITA for putting pressure on her to find a cat sitter?",

But my housemates decided to go to an event on the weekend, and invited our friend, and some others, to stay at our place for the event. I wasn’t going, as I was way too behind with work, and needed to go to the library early on the weekend.I was told by my housemates that our shared close friend would be sharing my bed with me, as they both are sharing a bed with another one of the girls. I was reluctant at first as everyone knows I hate sharing beds as I suffer with insomnia, and I wasn’t going to the event so wasn’t sure why I was now hosting, but sucked it up as she is one of my best friends.Turns out, that the spare bedroom we have wasn’t being used (which I thought it was). Just to caveat, it’s a single bed with a broken mattress so no one wants to stay in it, but is fine for a one night drunken sleepI said to my friend when she arrived, and they were all drinking in the living room having fun, that I’m going to sleep now as I need to be up at 7am, so pls try be quiet when you come into my room - but I also suggested, if you prefer not to be woken up at 7am if you’re staying up late tonight, the spare bedroom is free.She expressed that she was reluctant to stay in there as she has before and it was uncomfortable, but I said I can lay it out with some blankets and pillows to try make it comfy. I reassured her if  isn’t comfy, come into my room multiple times. I then made the bed for her and texted her saying it’s done, but once again no pressure and she’s welcome in my bed.One of my housemates then texted me in the morning saying: I do not appreciate you not being able to do anyone a favour. And I am yet to see you lift a finger for anyone that isn’t yourself.I explained the situation and that our friend seemed to prefer to stay in that bed than in mine as I was waking up for the library, but she said I guilt tripped her and manipulated her.

	"body" : "I am (25f) deeply connected to my childhood years and I consider them the best years of my life so far. My toys are the pride of my childhood.My family house (owned by father) was rented out by my uncle which is okay for me as I live overseas and I am sincerely happy someone is residing currently and looking after the property. Issue being he did not provide notice and moved my belongings without my input. EDIT To clarify the living situation, the house is partitioned into 3 spaces within the one building, my grandma living in one, my uncle in another, and myself and mum living in the last before we moved out, and the whole house including the 3 spaces is owned by my dad. My uncle had no authority to rent out my place and if he did so at least he should have done a proper job respecting my items. Mind you I am not getting a single penny for my house being rented out. The rental happened in secret and I could no longer return to gather my stuff as I was waiting for citizenship. Property belongs to my father and he did not consent to the rental at all. We all considered our family home as our safe place left unattended we would eventually return to.Issue being.. my uncle left my childhood toys in the rented out family house with strangers. As a result my toys were lost overtime. His excuse ? Not enough room. I told him if one wants to make room they can. My family are hoarders they have so much trash. I said if it was your stuff you would go above and beyond to keep them safe.People who transferred my stuff  are my mother and uncle. At that time I was overseas and was not allowed to go back home for bureaucratic reasons. My mother assured me she did not throw anything out and could not enter our family house as strangers were residing at that time and did not want to disturb them. My uncle admitted he left my stuff under my old bed and asked the tenants if the stuff bother them. They said no. But since then many tenants have changed.I was heartbroken and kept crying hysterically looking through storage rooms, under some stairs and a seperate room. It did hurt me that my stuff were not in a single place but rather scattered here and there. I felt like I was tirelessly collecting my pieces trying to reclaim control and keep my cool at the same time.I was relieving past trauma as years ago my step mother tore apart childhood photos which included my mom. I wasn’t present at that time. I found out when I last visited my family house. All my photos and even baptism pictures were placed in a little hole at the back of the house. It’s not an attic. (It’s legit just a hole at the back of the house that’s far far up. I had to climb there like a cat). That’s really bad as the moisture can severely damage my belongings. That happened years ago and again I was tirelessly collecting my pieces together. The hole where the pictures were placed is not safe at all to reach as one can easily fall and break their bones. I felt excluded from my own family. My dad did nothing to stop this.

In mid July I met my then boyfriend Tommy, 19, male we dated on and off until the end of august and called it quits as the relationship was extremely toxic. I would tell Sara all of the problems Tommy and I were having in our relationship and she would support me saying i should leave him and he didn’t deserve me. After leaving the relationship Tommy and I stayed friends and in the middle of october we ended up meeting up with a group of friends including Sara and reconsidering the end of our relationship. At the beginning of the relationship everything was going smoothly Sara was with her new Boyfriend, a good friend of the group, named Ryan, 19, male and Tommy and my relationship seemed to move in a positive direction after getting back together. In mid November Sara and Ryan broke up and this is when Tommy and I started to get distant. I noticed that after Sara and Ryan’s relationship ended Tommy spent more time talking to her and grew more distant from me, i just figured he was being a good friend as they insisted they had no physical attraction to each other and their friendship was completely platonic. So, one night Tommy was with his friends and I called to see what time he was gonna get home. I was shocked when his friends asked if I knew about the texts Sara had been sending Tommy. I was shocked and confronted Tommy immediately and asked if he had been cheating on me with Sara. He denied this several times saying that the messages were only one sided. I texted Sara and she told me a completely different story. At this point I didn’t know who to believe and so i chose to trust Tommy. Later that week I went on vacation with my family and while I was on my trip I got a message sent to me of a screen shot texts to Sara from my boyfriend about the cheating and him trying to disguise it. I was disgusted and broke up with Tommy immediately and told Sara that I shouldn’t have assumed it was one sided. This is where I maybe the assh*le. My friends are saying i should forgive her as it was entirely her fault and my boyfriend should’ve stayed loyal in the first place. But Sara and Tommy are now dating and I don’t know if I can find it within me to forgive them let alone stay friends with them.

I don’t know  much about how all the immigration laws work exactly so I won’t try to explain but the gist of it is that his visa was tied to his job and he got laid off not long ago. He left for his home country right after new years. He should be eligible to return but it’ll be a fairly lengthy process and he’s unlikely to return in the next year or possibly even two.Hannah is devastated. She was in love with him  and i feel terrible for how much hurt she feels right now. I love her and i do want to be there for her. She doesn’t have a lot of in person support in her life right now. But the support she needs is several hours long FaceTime calls multiple times throughout the week. And it’s been a lot.We’re in different time zones so FaceTimes me around 6pm (my time) and I’m on the phone with her until 9 or 10. She’s a bartender who doesn’t have early mornings while I have to be in the office by 7am and I like to go down to the gym before I get ready so I’m up around 4:30 every day. On top of conflicting schedules, I have a bit of a long bedtime routine.After a few calls, I realized that in order to get enough sleep I would either have to cut Hannah short or start getting ready for bed on the phone with her. She was still in a bad place so I went with the second option - doing my skincare, braiding my hair and brushing my teeth while she was talking. I could hear/see her just fine and I could still talk except when brushing my teeth but it’s like 3 minutes out of 180 so I thought that was a pretty good ratio.It was much better for me because I could basically hang up and roll over to go to sleep and I wasn’t so tired. But the next call, I brought the phone into the bathroom with me to start washing my face and Hannah said that she didn’t like it and it felt like I wasn’t listening to her or that she was bothering me. I said neither of those things is true but I needed to maintain my life too. She seemed bothered and cut the call short. I can’t say I wasn’t relievedShe sent me a text saying “it’s rude and it hurts my feelings. Why can’t you just acknowledge that?” I haven’t responded yet because I don’t know what to say. She did make me feel bad but I also feel annoyed because as much as I love her, I just don’t have 15+ hours a week I can dedicate solely to FaceTiming with her. But I know she’s very sensitive right now and maybe I’ve been inconsiderate by not focusing on her when she needs me. Also… it might just be considered generally rude, I’m not really sure.

Joan recently let me know that she's not sure how long the company will continue past the contracts we have in place for the next couple years. She has previously discussed her passion for data analytics & is looking to continue her career in SQL. She has mentioned how the IT Director has mentioned her name in this regard to our parent company & she plans on expanding her education with SQL to potentially get a job with our parent company doing this.I'm not sure of exactly what I want to do yet in regards to my career, but hearing Joan talk about SQL was interesting & I decided that I would start taking some free classes to see if SQL would be something I could see myself doing.In a private work conversation with our IT Director, he included a screenshot from our DEV team which included some SQL code. I mentioned, \"I'm thinking of taking some entry level SQL courses so seeing this now vs. after is going to be interesting for me haha. I appreciate the follow up.\" He mentioned that he would be setting up Joan with access & would also set me up as well. I was surprised by this & said \"I don't want to take anything away from Joan obviously, but if its no problem & would help me get some familiarity with the system, then I'd love that. I have zero experience but looking to learn a valuable skill\".Over the weekend I received a text from Joan asking why I was receiving SQL access. I explained exactly what happened and she responded by saying this sucks for her & I should've asked her first. We spoke on the phone & she explained that me getting SQL access takes away from the effort she put in to get access & that its selfish of me to use our IT Director as a resource, as that would take away from her. I validated her feelings & said that perhaps I could email & ask our IT Director where he started in his career & what kind of position I could start in where I could learn where what I want to do within Computer Science, as this would show that I'm not set on SQL & ask for some really good advice. We both agreed that this would work.The next day, I awoke to a text from Joan stating that the best form of damage control would be for me to just not respond to our IT Director regarding this any further & that she could just be my resource. She mentioned how she got me this job, covered for me, \"saved me from being fired multiple times\", pushed for my promotions/raises ,told me immediately when she thought the company was in trouble & gave me resources/ideas. She said if I care about her at all, I will drop this and find something else to do. I was confused by this so we spoke on the phone again & she reiterated that she doesn't think I am doing anything malicious but thinks I don't understand business relations & am actively in the process of ruining her career & that this could affect her future.AITA?",

As we headed to the exit we stopped for the restroom and a diaper change.The exit level has 1 family restroom with a toilet and a diaper change station, a women’s restroom with 6 stalls and no diaper change stations, and a men’s room also with no diaper change stations.We’ve been on other occasions and I’ve waited in lines for the family restroom before, as well as lines within the women’s restroom.As I approached, my husband was still a little behind me with our toddler, and there was no one waiting at the family room, so I headed inside alone and did my business, and texted my husband to bring our girl to the door so I could change her after I was finished.As I was washing my hands, I could hear a female voice outside saying something like “I saw her go in, it’s just a single lady”.I opened the door, saw my husband, beckoned to him to bring our daughter over, and she ran inside to me. As she came over, a woman standing right outside the door holding a baby said, “Seriously! We’ve been waiting!”I replied, “I understand, I’ve waited too, we’ll be done soon.”She called me a rude name, and I said “we’re all just doing the best for our families, I’m trying to be quick.”I closed the door and changed my toddler, not making it take any longer than necessary. While we were inside, I could hear the woman continuing to comment on how selfish and ignorant she thought I was being. As we walked out, she again called me a rude name. I walked straight out without commenting or making eye contact.I thought I was being efficient by going in first, and I don’t realistically think it took any longer than if my daughter and I had been inside together the whole time. I can see the view that we had “two turns” inside while another family was waiting. Maybe I should have used the women’s room myself, then waited to separately use the family room just for the diaper change, but that simply seemed like an unnecessary extra step at the time. Since I was carrying the diaper bag, my husband couldn’t have changed her simultaneously unless we had switched in advance and, again, it didn’t occur to me since I knew my daughter and I could both use the family restroom. I guess I could have waited at the family restroom for them to catch up and not gone in until we were together, I just thought in the moment since I was a bit ahead that I would be faster to just go myself first, instead of waiting for her to enter the room together.AITA?",

GC proceeds to leave his treadmill and stand next to me on mine trying to hit on me, asking me questions, telling me 'you look good' etc. At this point I gather my things and leave and go to another room, I feel really uncomfortable and have had bad experiences before when rejecting advances so opted not to say anything and just walk away.GC has had issues with another girl working at the gym and has been confrontational with her and this also contributes to knowing that I was right to just walk away.DH is a very angry person and is quick to anger, I didn't want anything to kick off so I waited until we were alone and away from the gym to tell him what happened and to avoid any confrontation. He works there so it is not hard to find the person and put a note on his file for harassment, also, i didnt want him to get angry, do something stupid and jeopardise his job there.Come home time, he's getting more and more worked up, saying things like 'I'm not that person anymore, I would have just said \"that's my wife, don't hit on her\"' then he asks me to repeat what happened, then flipped on me saying why didn't you tell him to f**k off and mimicking me being scared and crying, 1.

Note: I don't feel like a victim but felt creeped out, I feel this valid and putting a note on the file may help in the future if he does it again or he may have even done it before, the gym I'm at tries to minimise this behaviour, because obviously it's uncomfortable for women who just want to train.DH proceeds to get more and more angry, shouting, verbally abusive, words like 'cu*t being thrown around, etc. Do I really want a life with someone that I can't come to talk about these incidents that happen that make me feel vulnerable, and then to make me feel like it's my fault. I understand he must feel frustrated and he said so in so many words. I'm not sure speaking to another gym staff member about it instead would have helped either and would have upset DH because I didn't go to him.So, what I want to know is, AITA here or should I have just kept my mouth shut and not have said anything?EDIT: I just want to say thanks for the input and advice. It seems I have a lot to think about. When the situation is flipped on its head, I understand how this is abuse. I consider myself to be a strong woman, but not at the moment.

My sister and brother-in-law are moving near us, it was a cross country move and they have 4 kids, so they took two cars, and my (and my sister's) mom rode in the car my sister drove and my brother-in-law's mother (for simplicity, lets call her Kathy) rode in the car he drove. They took a few days to get here, and planned to stay with us (so we are talking 8 extra people at our house) for two nights after they arrive.Between us we made arrangements for all the meals in advance, but I bought a basket of snacks and fruit to have for people to eat in between, and invited everyone to help themselves.In the morning, I am making breakfast as planned, and Kathy comes in the kitchen an asks for an orange peeler. To be fair the oranges aren't like the easy-peel ones, it takes a bit of effort, but I don't have an orange peeler. I looked in the drawers, just in case I had one and forgot, but I really didn't. She sighed and asked why I put oranges out but not an orange peeler. (The reason is that I didn't know there were people who used them.) So I offered to peel an orange for her. Kathy said \"I am an adult I know how to peel an orange with the correct tool.\" So, I shrugged and left it at that.In retrospect, it would have made sense to offer to cut an orange for her, but I genuinely didn't think of it.AITA for not providing an orange peeler and instead offering to peel the orange?",

The dr said she could go back as long as she doesn’t carry heavy stuff and whatnot. When my sister told me her birthday plans about how she wanted to do brunch in the morning and dinner in the evening I told her that was fine but that I would for sure be there for her dinner only. She got upset and asked why I couldn’t just take the whole day off to be with her, and I explained to her that I needed to help my mom at work and make sure she’s okay and that I really couldn’t afford to take a day off due to me being in my schools Musical and I would need some saturday’s off for rehearsals and I wanted to work as much as I could to replace some of those saturday’s that I would miss. She was hurt and decided to change her plans for the entire day and said what was the point of keeping the plans if I wasn’t going. Fast forward to a week after her birthday (today) she called me and asked if I was at work and I said “No I had rehearsals this morning”, we continued to have a normal convo. After we hung up she texted me a few minutes later saying “Im gonna be real honest....im real hurt right now bc i try not to ask u for much. But u took a day off for school, but not for a big birthday celebration for me, which i never ask of you. I rarely ask you for things ever for my birthday and this is how i get treated.

So many customers, as well as the nature of said customers can often flare tempers. I myself have fallen victim to such frustrations on a few separate occasions.It edges to 4:11.

	"body" : "I'm (25f) a student and live in a dorm, but my dorm is actually a mini apartment. I have a friend (31f) from uni. This girl lives with her boyfriend in a different city, around 3.5 hour drive from my city. She used to travel to my city on Mon, stayed in a bunk bed at a hostel for 2-3 nights, and went back to her city.During the exam period one year ago, she was assigned to a bunk bed in a mixed dorm. She called me around 10pm asking if she could stay at my place. I said fine. She kept on saying how nice my room is, asking if she could stay for the exam period. As it would be only 3-nights stay, I didn't really mind.Fast forward to this October, she asked if she could stay 2 nights every week. I felt sorry for her when she has to spend a lot of money on traveling and hostel, so I said yes. I realized this is a wrong decision.I thought that she is 31, so she should know basic etiquettes like sharing the housework. But no, she never cleans the kitchen. When we run out of daily things like tissue paper, she just told me: Hey, we run out of it. She doesn't even take the trash out, even though the main trash bins are right downstairs. She just said, hey, the trash stinks. She does pay me some money, but it is not even a quarter of my rent. Mind you, dorm price is so cheap, may be even half the normal price. So a quarter of my rent is just 4 nights in a bunk bed at a hostel.The breaking point for me is one time, she arrived late. She forgot her toothbrush, and stores were all closed. I used an electric toothbrush, so I lend her a replacement head. I thought that she just used it that night and would buy a new one. But no, she continued to use it. I was so annoyed when I realized and I threw the head away. When she came back, she angrily asked my where is her toothbrush, I just said I threw it away. She complained she still used it, and I just said I didn't know, and I also did not have any extra heads. She complained she had to buy a new one tomorrow.We are going to be in exam period again. This time, she has stayed for almost 2 weeks. She said she would go to library to focus on studying, so she would not bother me too much. Again, I didn't know how to say no. I am going to have a very important exam in 3 weeks, and super stressed right now. I have a part-time job WFH, so now I stay home almost the whole day. She went to library maybe for 2 days every week, and stay inside my room all the other days. And she decides now is the time to lose some weights, so she does high impact cardio every day. I told her to go to the minigym in basement, but she complained it's cold and dirty. Maybe somebody will tell me go to library, but I keeps thinking this is my room, why do I even have to  give it up to somebody else???So all things combined, I want to kick her out of my room. I get to the point when I never actively start a conversation with her, so that I don't snap and say something bad.So, AITA?",

I just woke up because it’s hot, there’s no air, and she turned the AC off completely at some point. We have blankets but she says she prefers to sleep in her underwear. I think it’s unfair because she can easily put a blanket on if she’s cold but being on the top bunk it’s even hotter up here.There’s no fan in the room or windows open so zero air circulation. I really don’t want this to be a big fight but I’m tired of waking up at 5 am when the room hits 30+ degrees.

He kept making me feel bad about myself, explicitly compared me with other women on insta. He has made me feel unlovable and characterless for literally being with just 2 guys before him (last was over 3 yrs back). THERE IS A LOT MORE. But that rant is for some other sub.He still would flirt and had sent me d*** pic when I was upset with him for not being clear with what he wants with me. Yes! right when I was telling me I’m upset that I’m unsure what he wants from me, he sent me one. I got super angry and we decided to never talk. I was visiting his city to meet a cousin. He asked me to meet him but I didn’t. He had already given me a hundred reasons why I am not good enough for him. He later got angry that I did wrong to not meet him. He also told me that he wants to meet me in his apartment before he said if I’m uncomfortable we could go to a restaurant. I just thought I would be losing my self respect if I meet him. We started talking less.Fast forward to November, he sent a pic of his tongue. I’m a dentist. I asked him to get it checked. He didn’t do it. Rather started flirting again. We fought. Stopped talking. Last week he sent me the pic of his tongue again. I kept asking him to go see a doctor. He just doesn’t. I made him get a dental insurance. But that night he said more hurtful things like how I am a mess because I had dated two guys before. PS - I have a very normal past. Nothing wild. 2 relationships- for 3 months and 1 yr each, 7 and 3 yrs back, no contact with any of the exes right after the breakup. He never dated anyone.

Explanations for literally anything. Like this one time I got upset over a lost package and he judged me there too for being a neurotic??

I was happy he was happy everything was good until I met his girl best friend. He told me he had a girl best friend and I had a bad feeling about her but I ignored it I just put it as jealousy or having trust issues. So we were dating for about 3 months I finally met the girl best friend because I was otp with him while he was at work. He’s coworkers were gathered around his phone looking at me and calling me all types of names and being disrespectful they didn’t even know me but they was talking about me. I didn’t really say anything back I just ignored them but his girl best friend caught my attention when she decided to threaten me. After that I just hung up and told I’ll call him back but after I met his best friend a month later he changed and didn’t want to be otp with me anymore. The usual stuff guys do to their gfs when they talking to another girl. Anyways another month past we get into a small argument and he breaks up with me. I cried for everyday for two months then I reached out to him asking why did he break up with me he told me i wasn’t good enough and that I was the problem and I always play the victim and that I hurt him. After that I cried more and blamed myself. Soon the truth came out that I wasn’t the problem and he just left me for another girl (the girl best friend). Far forward to last year and now he has apologized more than once. He said he made a mistake and wants us to get back together and work things out. He told me he only wants to be with me ( if that was true why would he or anybody else hurt the person they only and really want to be with). We tried working things out but I had so much sadness and anger in me for him I keep on lashing out and I didn’t trust him at all. So we cut each other off. (That was last year). This year we started back talking and he wants to be friends and be on good terms. But I kinda still have feelings for him and I’m kinda still hurt from what he did. We talked about it and he knows I’m still hurting. He’s response to me letting him know I’m still hurting is that I need to move on from it and that he made a mistake and that I need to stop being stuck in the past. So am I the ahole for being stuck in the past and am I the ahole for not really wanting to be friends with him or be on good terms?By the way him and the girl are not friends anymore. He finally understood that he destroyed our relationship all because his ex girl best friend didn’t want to see him happy with anyone else. She never really wanted him.",

Now I am well on my way and financially capable of taking on a new friend. Over these years I've done a lot of research, I have specific breeders in mind (and I'm on some wait lists), and overall I have been prepping myself.A couple days ago, one of my sisters spilled the beans about a big surprise for me because she couldn't hold it in any longer. Everyone in my family is chipping in to get me a dog for my birthday. Wonderful, and they are thoughtful enough to get the specific dog breed I've been in love with for years! Originally I thought she brought me in to give some help and guidance but that was not the case. She brought me in because she wants me to \"pick the puppy I want\", and led me to a breeder's website. Suddenly I started seeing red flags and when I started looking the specific breeder up, even more red flags.I started telling her I wasn't sure about this breeder. I brought up my concerns, as well as things I've found online about this breeder, and what I personally was looking for in a breeder. Not to get into too much detail for a bit of privacy, but for instance, the breeder she has chosen seems to almost always have puppies and litters available most of the year. I also cannot find any public health records, which I've been able to with every other breeder I've been in contact with.After starting to push back on this, my sister in turn started pushing back on me with this. She had been doing a few months of research, sent messages and \"essays\" to over 50 breeders, and had really \"connected\" with this person after talking on the phone with them. Since then every time I've brought something up, she immediately says she understands but this breeder is fine.Eventually I flat out asked if she wanted me to send her anything like the bad reviews and comments I found on places like reddit and she said fine. I sent them to her. After reading them, I get a response back about 10 minutes later that just says \"I think they're talking about a different [insert breeder's name here]\". On top of that, she sent all the negative reviews and comments directly to the breeder in a show of \"full transparency\", which the breeder immediately got back with a bunch of comments explaining away the issues such as \"these are people that don't really know us or have never worked with us\" and \"people with this dog breed are incredibility cliquish\"I'm worried that she might just go ahead and get a dog from this breeder for me, she's much more concerned with \"giving me a dog rather than a check for a dog in the future\".This comes to my final question: WIBTA after all this that, if it comes to this, I refuse to take the dog. I get the idea of gift giving and I don't want to be ungrateful. However, this is a 10-15 year commitment and really should be my dog.",

Reluctant due to a previous six-month payback saga (just 100 bucks), I agreed against my better judgment.Fast forward; he hit a financial snag and couldn't buy it. I lent it, clarifying it was a loan. After bouncing back, he claimed he could buy it, and life went on.Four months later, he's financially strapped again.

I was only 70 hours into the game but most of my campaign we played together.After he finished his campaign, I asked if he wanted to play with me. He then sighed and told me he was just really annoyed by the way I played my game. He said he didn’t like the way I wanted to explore the map and talk to everyone, he doesn’t like the way I cast spells, etc. He said it really bothered him, and he just wanted to play a new campaign and be near for “advice.”I told him he was being ridiculous because it was my game and I played it the way I wanted to. I pick the dialogue options I want to. I do what I want to. I got really upset and hurt at what he said because I finally was enjoying myself again after a whole year of feeling down.I just turned everything off and walked away. He asked where I was going? I told him I was done playing. He realized I was actually very upset and changed his mind and said we could play. I told him he was an ass and if I did play, I didn’t want to play with him anymore. He said I misunderstood what he meant and it didn’t mean he didn’t want to play with me. I told him I didn’t want to play with HIM.I hit another member of our party up to play separately. He thinks I blew it out of proportion, and I’m the AH. He’s also acting extremely butthurt now.So did I blow this out of proportion by saying I didn’t want to play with him anymore?",

	"body" : "I am a 30yo f, youngest of 5 siblings. I am the primary caregiver for my elderly parents and i live with them. I dont have a significant other or family of my own(i.e. kids etc). All of my siblings do and are living separately but still within 40 mins drive of each other. Over a year ago my mom was diagnosed with cancer. The family knows this. A couple months ago it was discovered that her treatment isn't working that well anymore and she would have to transition to traditional chemo.the treatment still semi works but not as well as it did for the past year. After weeks of deliberations and discussions (mom, dad, and i along with her doctors), my mom has decided to not do chemo but rather continue the current treatment until the end. The oncologist cannot really estimate how fast the cancer will grow but estimates my mom to have 3 to 6 months.  Physically looking at her no one would know she has cancer, she just looks like a normal old lady. Since the beginning all my siblings were pretty hands off with her treatment, past the first couple months no one really brought up the subject. It was me shouldering everything alone. Taking mom to appts etc. Which i dont mind because shes my mom, but it bothered me that everyone swept it under the rug. They would do the normal greetings and visits and they continued to live and not ask about the cancer as if it doesn't exist. I am hesitant on telling my siblings because I honestly don't want to deal with them pestering me with questions about this that and the other when for the past over a year none of them asked how mom was doing related to the cancer treatment. It emotionally upsets me and my mom when we talk about it so I also don't want to upset her. We only recently officially told the oncologist that she does not want to do chemo and it was a very difficult appt. My mom and I are pretty similar, she would rather not be sickly/hospital bound only to potentially live another year or 2, because to her its not really living at that point, it's not comfortable. She also does not want people to fuss over her. I am conflicted on what to do and I keep pushing back when I should tell my siblings if at all. And I don't know how to even bring it up without having a whole sobbing session.",

Christine had left her very expensive bracelet in our hometown and asked if I could bring it with me when we go visit Alexandra.I got to the US before Christine and brought the bracelet with me but Christine ended up missing her flight and decided not to come on the trip.Fast forward 3 months, Christine asks me for her bracelet. In all honesty, I had completely forgotten about it as it hadn’t been brought up since the trip.I looked high and low for it and asked Alexandra if I might have left it in her apartment - she couldn’t find it either.Christine is understandably upset and wants me to replace the bracelet. My pov is that I was doing her a favour with bringing the bracelet and fulfilled the favor, it was up to her to follow up on it because the bracelet  not my responsibility once it arrived in New York.I do know I should’ve been more mindful but I didn’t want to take on the responsibility in the first place. I also cannot afford to replace the full bracelet.

I was extremely scared of his reaction, but he actually handled it well and just told me that he'll be talking about it with my mom (40F) about it. He also asked me if my mom knew, and I said yes, because she did.My parents have been divorced for about two years now, and they didn't end on good terms. Mom cheated on my dad, and hates him for some reason. My dad doesn't want her to hate him, and just wants to minimize any arguments between the two of them, but he fails each time.So, he ended up texting my mom when I was at school, asking her in a friendly way if it was true that she knew. She immediately texted me that she won't lie to him, but that I'm a huge disappointment for confessing, because to her, it wasn't true that she was letting me smoke. She said that she wasn't letting me, and that she just allowed me to smoke because she didn''t care. (So, she was basically letting me... Okay.)I was very stressed the whole day because my mom seemed very angry, and I was also suprised at how chill my dad was. Usually, he would be the one who would scold me for stuff like this, but he barely did.Like half an hour ago, when I got home (I live at my moms, and was just staying at dads for his weekly visit yesterday), my mom immediately started to yell at me, that all I do is think about myself, and that I'm very egoist, and that she should've kicked me out ages ago etc.. According to her logic, I should've lied to dad that I stole the cigarettes and that she didn't let me, so that she wouldn't have to argue with my dad. I'm autistic, so I'm always honest, and didn't even think about lying. I thought that actually coming clean would be a better option.Anyway, she's very angry, and I don't think I'm getting dinner tonight. My dad wants to have a peaceful talk about this situation with me tomorrow afternoon, and my mom told me to say that I lied about her knowing because if dad asks her again, she will deny it, but I'm still very torn on this situation. Was I the asshole? Should I lie tomorrow? Or tell my dad what honestly happened? Should I tell him about this, or listen to my mom?(Sorry for bad english)",

This is my last child and i decided prior to getting pregnant that my last child, whether female or male, would be getting this name (I have a feeling it’s a boy as we’ve got two boys so far).Now WIBTA if I used this name for my child?

	"body" : "I (27/F) have a child (3) with my exfiancé (27/M). Lets call him Luke. Luke and I have to decide which one of us gets to claim them this year on taxes. Doing so could bring our That to over $1000. background: I got pregnant while we were engaged but we broke up shortly before the birth. Based on the laws of our state I have full custody. We decided its best to split our time with them so we trade off weekly. We have no intertwined income and usually just pay for their needs individually. We agreed to trade off tax years but that was based on us sharing the work/cost of parenting. Thats not how its worked out. I live by myself with no real outside support. I do get help every once in a while from some family, but a good 85% is entirely just me. I pay all my bills and necessities. I rarely get babysitter. Luke does not pay child support which I have not requested.Luke lived with his family in an inherited home for the last 5+ years and has only recently decided to move out because of “boundaries”. He didnt pay rent. he paid some bills, but they were split among the other adults too. He doesnt make as much money as me but the largest reason is because he hasnt been able to keep a job.We’ve been attempting to co-parent which is not without its hardships. Luke has made it clear that hes been attempting to get out of parenting. He has repeatedly tried to excuse why he shouldnt take them including but not limited to: saying i have to keep them if they are sick with a cold my week so that it stays in 1 household only to say I should take them HIS week when someone in his house got COVID because the kid “probably didnt have it”, seeking late shifts/overnight jobs so he doesnt have to be home while they’re there, trying to find a job across the country that would keep him away 6+ months at a time because he said it was good money, and most recently saying the household is too toxic and not safe for HIM to be in. Because of the last reason, Luke has moved in with his new gf. He claims that he still sees our kid regularly, but after speaking with his family, he might get them from daycare 2-3x a week, but leaves soon after while the family takes care of the rest. There was even a few weeks after the most recent fight where he ghosted us all together. So while on paper we trade off evenly we really dont. Last year we had a big fight about this because Id claimed our kid the last 2x. This was hard for Luke because of the child tax credit and COVID benefits that he didnt get, so I can understand that. Its important to note that Luke has another child from a previous relationship and he claims them every year. Yes the family is picking up the slack for the other kid too.In order to claim our child Luke needs me to sign away my right but our mutuals have suggested NOT to let him and that he can stick with just claiming his first kid. But I want to be fair about this. I want to make the right and equitable choice. So AITAH?",

	"title" : "AITA for spreading my grandfathers ashes?",
	"body" : "TL;DR: I spread part of my grandpas ashes at my family’s plot after his wife cremated him behind our family’s back.I (f19) grew up very close to my grandfather. his daughter, my mom, raised me and my siblings as a single mother and Grandpa was a big help throughout my childhood. Him and our family have always decided that he would be buried in our family plot (where my late grandmother and great grandparents are).After my grandmother passed away, Grandpa remarried to “Doris”. Doris is nice and all but she hadn’t made much of an effort to connect with my side of the family. She’s made some slightly insensitive comments about my late grandmother at family gatherings. I’ve always blamed it on her being a little tipsy or something. Other than that she’s pleasant, and always welcome to family gatherings and holidays.My grandfather died in the hospital after a 4 day coma and my family was devastated. Doris was bedside for his last days and handled most of the paperwork. However, she decided to have him cremated without consulting my mother or anyone from our side of the family. In fact, she lied about having Grandpa cremated, and compromised with my mom to have him buried in a local cemetery so she could be close to him.We only found out that he hadn’t been buried when Doris showed up to our home WITH HIS ASHES in a grey urn. She said it was a last minute decision and that she couldn’t imagine a life without him and now he can stay in the house etc. etc…While she and my mom were arguing and calling family members, i took a portion of his ashes, drove to our cemetery and spread them at our family plot. I didn’t think anyone would notice but i guess i hadn’t closed the urn properly and i confessed to what i did when Doris confronted me. I told her it was a “last minute decision”. She’s furious and insists that she’s never speaking to our family again. No one else in the family knows and I don’t think Dorris is going to reach out to them, and my Mom is glad that at least some of him is in our state but wishes I could’ve done that with her permission/knowledge. I definitely could’ve handled that better but AITA?Edit: I see that I was TAH here. In that moment I think I was just kinda knocked sideways that no one other than Dorris knew he would be cremated. Me and Grandpa talked about what flowers I would leave for Grandma when he passed and couldn’t bring her any anymore. We talked about how I could stack stones and shells by his headstone like we did when I was little. There was nothing that would make me think he’d change his mind. But now it’s over and done with and while I was an AH for doing what I did, I’m a little glad that a part of him is still here. As for Dorris, I emailed her an apology, haven’t heard back. My mother is negotiating to have a portion of his ashes to keep here but we haven’t heard anything yet, which is probably my fault for taking that liberty and spreading his ashes anyway.

As a result, I am the one responsible for taking care of my brother.---> I asked Bill to stop playing games on his laptop (had been playing for more than 6 hours at least), waited until his game was done then gave him some revision work to do that he learnt last year (this is somewhat of a daily routine, since it is the holidays and he has a test early next term based off what he learnt last term, so I give him 2 worksheets to do so he doesn't forget) and continued on with my own homework.> Bill immediately gets upset (for what? i have no idea. for asking him to do work? for speaking to him?), slams his laptop closed and storms off to his room. (common occurance, has happened around 4 times a week since the holidays started)> I give him some time to cool down, then go to his room to try to talk about it with him, or at least make sure he is okay.

Bill always sneaks around and once he gets caught he promises to be better and put effort into changing, but that is yet to happen.> After I get angry though, he begins to cry and says that he can't control it, that he just wants to stop. I feel so bad about yelling at him, I don't even know if I have a valid reason for getting angry. I don't know if I should have done other things to help him or if the way I was approaching him was wrong.---In my perspective, at home, Bill only plays video games, even though his school therapist has told him he should limit his screen time to 1 hour a day.I understand that he is still young and may have trouble with self-control, so I try to consistently remind him, I've given him productive things to do, bought books that he said he was interested in, and made sure he had manageable chores to do (washing up dishes after we eat because I have eczema on my hands and dish-washing liquid makes it flare up).But all he does is get annoyed at me and at this point my mood plummets when I'm coming home because I know it's just going to be tiring trying to dodge everything that might make him suddenly upset.---However, Bill really is kind and thoughtful, and there's nothing wrong with his personality except perhaps being quick to anger.

He's never been married and has no kids of his own.We go to each other's family events together without any issues, but here lately he's been upset with me because I don't want to drag my kids and I to his nephew's games on weeknights. His sister lives 45 minutes away from us and you never know where they're gonna have the games at. I wouldn't expect his sister to drag her 2 kids to watch mine doing extra curricular activities, and I feel like she would definitely understand. But for some reason, he doesn't understand and is mad at me and pulling the rude comments out saying I've made it perfectly clear that I don't care about his family and that I refuse to go even though that's not what the issue is at all. I'm just tired and unfortunately I have more important things to take care of at home.Not to mention, my 6 year old has ADHD and by the time we get home around 5:30-6pm, his meds have worn off and he gets wild. I don't want to force him to sit in a seat and try to make him be still because it's not fair to him and it'll just be a fight that's not worth having.AITA?",

They said this new house had good wifi, so i agreed to move. And when we finally moved in and got settled they said they’d call the company that installed the wifi. Well… to say the least it hasn’t been installed at all. When I frequently asked them about it, they said they’d call the company.So last week i asked them again, and the same thing was said. I told them: “Are you sure? Because you have told me this for 2,5 years now and I’m getting tired of waiting.” They responded “it’s not that deep…” and this quickly escalated into a whole discussion. It basically ended in them telling me: “if you don’t like it, then you can just move out, you’re old enough.” I stormed off and haven’t spoken to them at all.So, please help me out on what to do.",

We have a large glass jar that we keep our caffeinated blend in (a 50/50 mix of two coffees that smell and taste good together, that we both like), and on the white lid I'd labelled it with 50/50 (two coffee names, I forget), alongside the mix that I use for actually preparing the coffee: three scoops regular, two scoops decaf. (The decaf I was buying was the cheap stuff, so it smelled gross unless you mixed it with enough regular coffee.)The very day I did it, we were both in the kitchen, I showed her, explained it to her, pointed out the instructions on the lid (at least, how I prepare it) so that she's informed, even made coffee as I had been doing for about a week prior, counting out the scoops, everything within my power to let her know how I make the coffee the way I like it- even mentioning that it's best to let it finish brewing instead of taking a cup of it out before it's even halfway done because that will be a lot stronger than the rest of the pot, AND makes the rest of the pot taste watery and weak, because that is something that she'd been doing.About for years later (about a week or so ago now), she blows up at me for showing her the lid and explaining to her that I've been making it the exact same way for the past four years, and had told her how I make it more than once. She then asked if I was trying to kill her by putting in so much regular coffee, with the context being that she had an unrelated heart issue a week prior. She made it out as if I had actively been poisoning her with caffeine AFTER her heart issue, when I hadn't even made coffee since then, let alone the two weeks before that.For context, I have Marfan Syndrome and an unusually high BPM, so I'm super wary of caffeine intake and stuff. I don't pour her a cup of coffee unless she asks (only happened twice), I don't tell her to drink coffee, I don't tell her to watch how much coffee she drinks, as I'm not HER mother. She drinks what she wants, and I had informed her how I make it.Due to her reaction, and how much it hurt hearing her make an accusation like that, I've since given up coffee entirely, and gifted everything coffee to her.

I am disabled, wheelchair and walker reliant. Mom has not worked in over 30 years and cannot get into the modern work force because she has a lot of major health issues herself. Neither of us have managed to win disability just yet, but she does surveys and networks small product testing. I do art commissions and surveys, and have friends who periodically help out when I'm too bedridden to manage anything. Essentially, mom and I are the breadwinners, and my grandmother owns the house and pays our light bill but lives in another city now.My sibling (32) and their roommate (idk how old she is but she's near our age) do not work. Neither appear to be looking for anything either, which is why I'm mad - I have asked and had even been letting them use my phones hot spot as we cannot afford wifi. Their roommate moved in a month after my father died because she lost her job after she got arrested for stealing out of the registers at her place of employment, and I was promised I would be included in the talks that were to be had BEFORE she moved in. I wake up one day to learn I was not included because according to my sibling, I was not \"necessary\" to the decision - bullshit, because I keep track of finances, groceries and pet care. Now we have an extra mouth to feed on an already non-existent steady income.Fast forward to the last two months in particular - the two of them are somehow finding small inconsistent income, but still absolutely not covering their priorities and blowing money on ridiculous items (expensive take out in one night that could pay for a week of groceries, etc). And then the roommate developed a medical issue that requires pain treatment. All fine, but she runs out of her pain meds way too fast. I have fibromyalgia, a chronic neurological pain condition, and have pain meds myself.Que the pressuring from my sibling to (illegally) share my prescriptions to help ease their roommates pain. I'm talking bribing attempts, such as money or food, etc. I finally put my foot down and told them never to ask me ever again. Now I'm being met with hostility. There are now middle of the night trips out of the house despite my mom and I being told her car has no gas - they are forbidden access to my mom's van - and things are not adding up. There's secrecy, dodgy behavior, etc. Now I'm scared of the potential illegal activities causing us safety issues. We live in a rather run down town, it's never been the safest.

It’s especially hard to water the animals during the winter due to the water hose freezing up quickly and I had to always do everything by myself.I asked for help from my grandmother many times but she said it was a one person job and I don’t need help.

	"body" : "Hey let me give you some context. At 5:40pm on Tuesday, Jan 9th, one of my friends texted me, panicking. She asked me to call her, I did so. Over the phone she told me she had found a small kitten on the side of the road in the snow. The kitten looked to be in bad shape, she said she didn’t have the money or space to take care of the cat (she lives in a small camper with two large dogs). I told her I would talk to my parents and possibly take off to take the cat in (I’ve taken rescue cases in the past). My parents agreed. At 6pm I took off on a 2 hour journey on super icy, snowy roads with more snow coming down. My 2 hour drive turned into 3. I arrived at my friends place at 8:45pm (not that that makes any real difference). My friend met me out at my car, and handed me the kitten. At first glance I could tell the kitten was super skinny. But looked okay. My friend had told me she had given the kitten a bath (there was no evidence of her giving this kitten a bath, the kitten was FILTHY). I hurried home the best I could on the bad roads. I arrived home a little before midnight. After I got everything set up and the kitten settled in, my friend texted me wanted the kitten back. I told her no. (Am I in the wrong here?). I told her the kitten is far too weak to be traveling around, I also told her with her living situation (no offense to her), she would not be able to give the proper care to the kitten. She fought with me on this. But I kept it firm that I’m keeping the kitten so she can receive the proper care. Let me add, my (ex) friend, was planning on feeding the kitten straight MILK as food instead of getting her kitten food. Anyways, she finally agreed to have me keep the kitten, I thought that was the end of it. But no, she started back up the next day. Her “fiancée” was apparently crying and wanting the kitten back. I once again said no. I already had a vet appointment set up, and the kitten was extremely happy where she is at. My friend ended up blocking me at the end of it. I’m now hearing from mutual friends and other sources that my now ex friend is trying to seek legal action on me ? OVER THE CAT? She apparently has been in contact with a police officer? I’m calling bull on that, due to the fact, if she actually did, wouldn’t I have gotten a call of some sort of contact from a cop? She apparently is trying to take me to court bc I “stole” her cat. She’s now making bold face lies saying she owned the cat before hand and she ran away. Which I know is NOT true. She has never owned a cat. She also said that the cops said it’s fine her dogs are unlicensed and unvaccinated?? What kind of cop would say that? (We live in Michigan btw, it’s illegal to have your dog unlicensed). But back to the story, The kitten has had her vet appt, she’s completely healthy! Besides extremely frost bitten paws, being super underweight & very dehydrated. But besides that she’s super happy and has a little belly now! But, AITA for telling her no and keeping the cat?",

Long story short this ended up with my parents getting divorced when I was 5 and me and my sis and mom living in and out of hotels and peoples house because she believe god told her not to work therefore we were poor.My dad ended up buying a house when I was 10. So me and my mom and sis lived with him. My sis moved out at 20 me and my mom are still living with my dad. Me and my sis have a good relationship though.I am currently getting my masters degree and working part time. I’ve been saving money to move away. Idk what to do with my mother.My mother has refused to work for 20+ yrs because god told her not to. Basically I give her money everytime I get paid so she can buy herself stuff. IF it wasn’t for me she would have no clothes, shoes, food. My dad allows her to stay in the house and if it wasn’t for him we would be homeless. I help out with bills, I buy all groceries and toiletries and give my dad money when he needs some help.Her working would help us tremendously. She contributes nothing. We have been here for 13 yrs and she has done nothing. She told me god said he would get her out of this house ( idk how?). She also told me that before I was born god told her that she would be a millionaire ( again idk how)She has no friends. She sits in the house all day everyday watching videos on YouTube and tv. She does arts and crafts sometimes. She can and feed herself do the  normal ADLs. She says she don’t trust people she has no family on her side (cut off from them for good reasons mother mentally abusive and father sexually abusive). She told me she used to hear god talk to her when she was a child. As I’ve gotten older I realize this may have been from abusive she endured and this voice is probably a coping mechanism.I think my depression and anxiety came from being a trauma dump for my mom as a child and even now . She would tell me about how her parents abused her she complains to me everyday. Everything that comes out of her mouth is negative and is from stuff that happens to her 10+ yrs ago. It’s hard to  listen to constantly when I’m dealing with my own shit and being told it’s demons.Anyways, my bf lives in Chicago. We met at college and he got a job there he told me I could live with him when I’m done with school. I have come to the realization is that I’m not going to have a life of my own.My sister told me that if I cut her off she might get help. Idk if I can…I don’t  want to do that though. I lost out on my teenage years  being stuck in the house and not having fun and experiences because of her coddling. Know I feel like I’m going to miss out on my 20s because I have to care for her.

After finishing school, we didn't see each other as much so she started coming to my house every couple weeks since my family would be out. I went to hers recently, which was nice but brings me to the main story.So two weeks ago on Saturday, I went to Penny's house. It was about 4pm when I left which meant it was dark but not pitch black. I usually have no problem with walking home when it's like that since it's a 10 min walk and all on a main road. However, whenever Penny has walked home from my house, she has always asked me to walk with her because she didn't like walking home on her own. It really rubs me the wrong way that she doesn't feel comfortable doing it, but she's comfortable with me doing it. The part that annoys me the most is that she has just bought her car a few days prior to this happening and while I get her not feeling comfortable driving it without another driver yet, her dad was home and I don't think he was busy enough to not drive me home/sit in the car with Penny while she drove.The following Tuesday, I had to go to an ENT appointment at the hospital. Penny and I have both been to countless ENT appointments so we both get it. We both stopped going to our appointments when we got older because we didn't want the fuss anymore. I also have a big fear of needles and operations and just overall hated the anxiety. Penny knows about all of this. I told Penny about my appointment when I first got the call and then on Saturday. Fast forward to Tuesday and no message about it. I didn't want to confront her straight away in case she remembered it later but nope, it's been a week now and no message about how it went or anything.Then on the following Friday, I had my first ever paid photography gig. I told her about it when I got asked to do the photos and talked about how nervous I was on the saturday. But I got no message about that either.Yesterday I finally got a message from her asking me if I wanted to go to hers this Saturday, specifying that she would be able to drive me home this time. I haven't replied to her message and today she followed it up by just sending a \"?\". I feel like she knows I am pissed at her because we never go this long without messaging each other, but I don't think she knows the truth of why I am pissed at her. Thing is I still want to be friends with her because of all the good times we've had, even at hers on Saturday was great until I had to walk home alone. Now I'm starting to feel like I'm overreacting and it's not really that big of a deal so I should just reply and go on as normal. But I also feel like friends should try to keep each other safe and remember important things in their lives. My family are backing me up, but because of previous issues me and Penny have had, I feel like they might be biased. So AITA?",

Claire and I have always gotten along and even talk outside of work however our relationship wasn’t nearly what I thought it was once promotions became a discussion. She came to me one day about a year ago and said that she and our manager were speaking about who would be promoted once our new branches opened up.He said that I would more than likely be his pick for AGM. She then told me that if I were to get that promotion over her she would quit. I hid the fact that I was hurt and just assured her that I wouldn’t take it even if it was offered due to my schedule. We discussed it further and I told her that the only management position I would consider was sales manager, and her face lit up as she fervently agreed. That was the end of that, or so I thought.Fast forward to a couple of months ago, our company took on a new system and our General manager tasked me as well as her to learn it. I did so quickly and our manager was pleased with this and spoke with me about us needing a new sales manager!That next day he gave me a spot in the back office and told me to organize it how I’d like and that this was now my designated area. I worked all day getting it set up and when Claire arrived to work and saw me sitting at the desk she turned to our current AGM and said “that’s it I quit”.

I didn’t even get a congratulations.Fast forward again, she is promoted to a front desk manager.

I even offered to rearrange the office to make room for her but our GM said it’s the brand restrictions, FDM’s just don’t get a desk. Shortly after every time I would come back to work from the weekend I would find things rearranged at my desk and I would be logged out of my computer. (I only locked it because it is very slow to log you back in if you log out.) I knew it was her so I asked her to please keep things the way they were if she was to use my computer. She of course became defensive stating that she only uses because she has to, she doesn’t have a computer. Which isn’t true, she has the front desk, but that’s not the issue.I came into work today on a day off to discuss some things and she was at my desk, my personal belongings were knocked over, her cup was sitting on the brand new full coverage mousepad that I just bought and she had random fast food sauce packets laid along the desk.

Well, our friends came over and stayed for about 3-4 days, and revealed some information to us about alcohol causing relationship issues and some other things. We were respectful enough to not order alcohol if we ate out and we were careful to not mention alcohol around them as we know it can be triggering. Our friends flew home after a couple of days and we thought that everything was fine. I noticed that the one friend that usually speaks to me at least on an every few days basis was not responding to messages. I thought this was strange but let it go. After about 3 weeks of not talking I receive a message from this friend about how they will no longer be speaking to us and she didn’t specify why. It was a very vague message and to be quite honest it had me going through the entirety of their stay wondering what happened. These are friends that we have experienced a lot with and ending a long friendship so abruptly seemed weird. I let it go, and sent the friend a message two weeks later to ask if we could discuss this issue, as it bothered both of us quite a bit. The friend refused to speak about it with me. So, we figured that it was just over and we’d go our separate ways. A week later, I receive a series of messages explaining how upset and appalled they were with us for having alcohol in our house after the recent issues it had caused. For reference, we have a bottle of beer in the very back of the fridge and a liquor bottle in the freezer. During the visit, late a night one night the husband in the relationship drank half of the liquor and the entire beer. We didn’t notice due to not consuming alcohol often enough. This caused a fight between the two them and subsequently caused them to blame us for making it available. I understand that this can cause issues having it available, but for us to drink so infrequently it was an afterthought. I understand alcoholism is a serious thing, but should it be completely our fault if he chose to drink it?ETA: they stalled on telling us the issue, but the majority of our mutual friends seemed to know as soon as they got home.

She ignored my question, and didn’t hang up until about 10:10pm.Then she turned to me and snarled: “Just so you know, that really pissed me off!”I was totally startled. I asked her what she was mad about. She said she was angry that I interrupted her phone conversation, she said she misses her family and I was being rude to interrupt. I told her I apologize for interrupting, but I didn’t mean to be rude, I just wanted to turn off a light. She didn’t stop being angry with me.I just don’t think what I did was rude, but she was adamant. This roommate has been extremely difficult to live with, I try really hard to not bother her but she just seems to get angry so easily. Even other Soldiers here have been intimidated by her. She is constantly telling us how “pissed off” she is and makes jokes about her bad temper.I just can’t understand how what I did was rude, but she insists that it was.So, AITAH?",

	"body" : "My (M19) brother (M15) lives with his foster parents, Gail (F, 50s) and George (M, mid 50s). He's been living with them for the past ten years, they've even gotten to the point where they want to adopt him before he legally becomes an adult, but it's been a struggle.I do see him occasionally, although usually the time we spend together is overlooked by Gail. She is overprotective of Gene to a fault, she acts as though he is five, not fifteen. They just don't seem to understand that he is a teenager now, not a child who needs to be forced into conforming to their useless rules.He isn't allowed to dictate what he looks like, I once bought him a band t-shirt that he asked for, and apparently it was confiscated for being 'inappropriate.' - it was a The Smiths t-shirt. Any sort of 'alternative' aesthetic he tries to go for is shut down. He's not allowed to stay out with his friends past 8pm, and Gail seems to think that our relationship is unhealthy because we hug each other, and because he once fell asleep with his head on my lap.It was his birthday recently, I took him up to Manchester for it. At one point, we ended up going into Affleck's, and at the back of one of the shops is a piercing studio. As I had a fair bit of money on myself, I offered to pay for him to get a piercing - he ended up getting his lip done. We even bought him a clear retainer for when he has to go to school.His parents were not pleased however, and Gene texted me about them getting very upset over it. Last time I came over to their place to see Gene, they started berating me for not asking their permission beforehand, saying that if he got an infection his placement could've been jeopardised, and that I had no right to make that call on allowing him to modify his body.Personally, I saw nothing wrong with it, I mean he's old enough to decide if he wants a removable piece of metal in his face or not. But now, I am curious what other people would think.",

Over the past four weeks, we've had limited opportunities to meet, and communication issues have arisen, leading to feelings of frustration and disconnection.The first weekend, my daughter had surgery, and despite initial plans for my boyfriend to visit, he didn't due to predicted snow. When I expressed my struggles and sadness, he got angry, dismissing the importance of not seeing each other for a weekend. Later, he revealed that he didn't feel sad about missing the weekend and emphasized the significance of time apart.The following weekend, I attended a work event and drove to him, excited to spend time together. However, due to an unexpected snowstorm, I had to leave early. Expressing my feelings of missing him, he hugged me but didn't offer much reassurance. In an effort to show love, I sent him treats via delivery.Approaching the third weekend, I expressed my desire to visit, highlighting the limited time we had spent together recently. Despite improved weather conditions, my boyfriend seemed hesitant, eventually advising against my visit. Feeling frustrated and confused, I stayed home. Later, he went out with friends, and when I expressed my disappointment, he got irritated, claiming it was ridiculous.Feeling disconnected, I reached out to him, expressing my love and a desire to reconnect. However, he reacted negatively, perceiving the conversation as a waste of time and expressing exhaustion with emotional discussions. He even mentioned doubts about providing the caring support I need.AITA for reaching out to him about reconnecting? I rarely open up and talk about things, even if they're bothering me, because of his reactions or because he is uncomfortable with these things.UPDATE: He called me and told me that because I said three weeks ago that I was sad to not see each other that I was textbook clingy and that if he presented that to anyone, they would agree.

My rental home was too far away from my ex's workplace so we found a new rental house. In my country, normally, the renter does the painting or wallpaper themselves as well as laying laminate( or other flooring) themselves. Luckily we both have family that wanted to help and I planned to move in about a month later.My ex her dad has a talent for that, which was wonderful but he only came one day every week. He works a fiscal job so it's reasonable but we were also not allowed to do work ourselves or only work with my family I didn't want to piss off my father in law so I left it at that accepting that I would pay double rent for an extra month or so( my ex didn't chip in for the new house) my family was also not that welcome to come to help if he was working on the house, a lot of grumbling under his breath. He also didn't take my talks about wanting to move in soon, double rent, etc not seriously and just did projects that would be just fine to do later, such as doing the garden, working in the shed, working in the attic, etc. don't get me wrong I am very grateful for all his work.After two and a half months of this very infuriating process, I gave my two weeks' notice to my old landlord and told my father-in-law I would move in soon and I would move into weeks and my father, stepfather, and uncle would be into laying the laminate that week, that was not a fun talk.That weekend when my dads and uncles were working on the floor we all had lunch together. my father-in-law had his fist under his underarms so his muscles looked bigger. I have never seen anybody do this(also never him before this) and he just kept talking and talking about himself and how he just does not do things that would be embarrassed about. So I said, \"Pumping up your muscles to make them look bigger would be something to be embarrassed about\". This I an asshole thing to say and I said it out of close to three months of frustration.Now to my question. Skipping to last month, (my ex split up 5 years ago after I found out my ex was sleeping around. ) I got an email from my ex telling me I have to say sorry for making him feel less than a man. My ex-father-in-law has developed depression and my words were the biggest reason for it.People around me are split up about how big of an asshole I am so what do you think?",

I don’t resent them and I know they love me and it was just bad vibes at the time but it’s hard to just forget all that.Plus our mom’s not well so Josh and my other older siblings helped out a lot growing up. We were pretty broke lol but Josh would secretly give me a little more allowance than everyone else and he’d spend all his free time with me because he was worried about me.

He doesn't really have a job since he resigned from being a computer programmer nearly a decade ago so I have been relying mostly on my brother's monthly allowance to get by since my mother resigned from her job as well. Alex and my mother, Eden, are separated and don't really talk with each other due to some personal issues regarding their marriage.Before, Eden used to hold the bank card that my brother, David, would send money into and it would be her who then sends the money here. This had caused a bit of a struggle because money is usually short and we would barely be able to cover all of our daily expenses for the month. When I met up with her during Christmas however, she then gave me the card and said that I can keep it as long as I promised her that Alex doesn't know and that he won't be involved in our finances. She doesn't really trust my father with anything and since him and David had a recent falling out, he agreed as well. I said yes and accepted it because it would be much less of a hassle once I can control the money directly.When I got back however, I knew that I couldn't really keep it a secret from my father since most of our household expenses are intertwined and he doesn't have much of a source of income. I haven't been holding the money back and I have been paying what was needed but I haven't been eager to hand the money out either. This is because Alex doesn't really have the best track record of keeping money and I knew that my mother and brother would be disappointed in me if they found out how fast the money from the account went. They aren't really fond of him.Recently, Alex has compared me to our family members and is talking about how I am just like them. He says that he isn't out to steal my money and that he's hurt I think otherwise. He tried to start a conversation about how excited he was to hear that I won most of the New Year's games and how much I earned but I brushed him off because I was studying for my exams and I was worried about the brownout that wouldn't stop. I don't really think he's out to get me, I'm just worried since I know that Eden and David would scold me if they see that the money has been running away quickly when I am only one person. David has said before that he was willing to stop sending money when he and my father got into an argument so I don't really want to get on his bad side.

After GCSEs me and two of my other friends left to pursue our post-16 education at different schools but still kept in close contact with the original friendship group three years later.One person in the friendship group (Emily), has recently been reposting and creating tiktoks that insinuate that we have been horrible friends with her such as never speaking to her, how we don’t invite her to places, etc.I admit that, towards the final year of secondary, we were getting tired of having to constantly ask Emily for her opinions of the topics we talked about to include her only to get responses like “I don’t know” or just shrugging her shoulders. We would try and find out what topics she liked so that we could talk about those with her so she could be included too but she would not tell us as she would say that we wouldn’t find the same things interesting despite us insisting we would like to know. I only found out that she liked similar things to me when I had already left for a different school through posts she liked on instagram. I openly talked about these interests within a smaller group setting so she could have been included in the conversation too.In addition, we had a whatsapp group chat with all of us included and when we would make plans, she would never respond until we mentioned her only for her to immediately respond with no. This happened every single time to the point that in the initial invite messages we would mention her. At first we considered that she had strict parents and tried to make accommodations for her such as meeting up with her at her place and accompanying her out or choosing places close to where she lives, but we found out her younger sister is allowed to go out on sleepovers so we just assumed she doesn’t want to go out and therefore stopped including her in plans during our final year.It wasn’t until the end of year 12 (ages 16/17) that the friends that stayed at the school cut her off. Since then, her posts and reposts on tiktok have been about bad friends. We know that it is about us because we are the only friends she has had — her friend of 10+ years says Emily barely spoke to her or teachers.Emily says she has social anxiety and I understand how difficult it is to talk to other people when you have it but not even involving yourself in text conversations? She has made online friends and talks to them as well as talking to her younger sister’s friends, so are we actually the problem and being insensitive to this?My friends and I want to confront her and talk about it because we got annoyed at her for essentially bad-mouthing us yet she would still ask us to support her hobby accounts and be nice when we do have small interactions, essentially being two-faced.WIBTA?",

The death of my husband didn't change anything between us, it united us. My MIL and I speak every day. We are close.Info: After losing 2 family members in such a short time, after the funerals, solving the estates, etc, we talked about taking a family trip. A week in a cabin in the woods by the lake, or going to Disney, or somewhere in Europe. Do something for us, to feel better.The plan was always to go me, my two BILs, SIL, and MIL.Last year BIL and SIL went to London for their honeymoon. They had been together for 25 years and after having kids that are now adults, decided to go on that trip. When they returned, they mentioned wanting to go to Italy in 2024. BIL (P) mentioned wanting to go, and I too said I wanted to go. MIL too. We decided that this would be our family trip after dealing with two deaths.I mentioned how important that trip was, as I've been dealing with grief and really needed it. Every time the occasion came and we talked about Italy the conversation was the same. We can't wait! It'll be fun! We need it! It'll bring us closer as a family!Not once did I hear, or felt like I wasn't part of that conversation. Not once. Always included, and no one ever mentioned that I wouldn't be welcomed.Tonight MIL messaged me and we talked about her day. Then, she mentioned that BIL, SIL, and BIL2 are going to Rome in May. She said she couldn't afford it so she's not going and is sad. This was news to me. I replied that I was hurt and heartbroken that I wasn't asked. Especially after talking about a trip and Italy for so long. I was honest with my feelings and told her it would change things for me and the family and how much part of it I feel.She mentioned how for Christmas they bought me my car carpets, and they were expensive and how I shouldn't feel sad or less part of the family or less loved by them. They assumed I wouldn't be able to afford it (I can). They thought I wouldn't like it because I prefer to plan ahead while they don't (It doesn't matter to me).I told her that the carpet and the trip were two different conversation for me. That it didn't change anything, they didn't ask. Or even consider me once. All the trip was discussed, planned, and paid without asking me once. I apologized for making her feel like I sounded like I wasn't thankful, but as a widow who is lonely, I was really looking for that trip.I want to call BIL tomorrow and ask what happened.

This led me losing motivation/interests to chat with this guy over the course of next month. I barely made effort to actively engage in our conversation and kept my responses short. It was bad enough that I would only text him a quick hello once a week (if he texted me first) before ending our conversation.Last weekend, I decided that I would stop pursuing my friendship with this guy as it was clear that my depression was clouding my judgement and stopping me from continuing to talk with him. But I didnt want to just ghost him the next time he texted me, since I believe ghosting people out of nowhere is a very asshole-ish thing to do.

Our parents and grandparents supported us emotionally and financially. So I find it hard to sympathise with her addictions, which I think she is responsible for creating for herself.  A few years ago, her boyfriend (who she met in rehab and moved in with 2 months later) overdosed and died which obviously impacted her behavior (though she was already on a terrible trajectory). She's constantly  making her problems everyone else's problems. Every year or so, she has a major meltdown and overloading/dumps her issues onto my mother. I've witnessed her ruin my mom's life, peace and mind for the last 10 years and I truly resent her for it. Yesterday, her boyfriend broke up with her and thus begins her first meltdown of the year.My mom is begging me to contact my sister and try to help in some way. I think what my mom really wants is for some of the responsibility of having to listen to my sister constantly be given to someone else. She is sick of always being the one to deal with it and I don't blame her. But I really don't want to speak to her. At this point, I feel only very negatively about my sister. She has no problem dragging everybody else down to her level of constant misery. I have \"been there\" for her many times and it does nothing but drag me down. I'm sure she was terrible to be in a relationship with, and so, I think good for her boyfriend for ending things with her... She also regularly complained about him anyway and how sick of him she is, how she could never tell him she loved him, etc. How can I tell my mom that I love her and want to support her, but that I am no longer willing to take on my sister's problems when refuses to do anything for herself. I don't care what my sister does, but I do care how it affects my immediate family.",

	"body" : "My husband and I moved to another state about 2 years ago we were happy(finally) no relationship issues and he was getting a lot better with his father. However, my husband lost his job for a while and we were struggling a bit but I still had my job and he was just looking for another one. That's when his father started calling and telling him that If he didn't do something to make money fast I would leave him since he thinks \"a house without money is a house without love\" his words exactly.Now, my father in law owns a transportation company in FL and before we moved my husband managed the company for a while until he decided that working with family wasn't for him since his dad would give him a really hard time so much that he started getting sick due to the stress.He manipulated him to come back to work for him again because he said my husband was not good enough to find a better job where we were. We talked and I said I would try my best and sacrifice the job I had and the happy and stress-free life we had since it seemed like it was the right to do by my husband. The thing is that not long ago I found out that his father has everything in the company under my husbands name and this includes cars, properties and LOANS which has started affecting my husband because honestly his dad hasn't done a very good job managing the business and owes a lot of money.You see me and my husband made a deal with my father in law. We promised to help him get everything in order again but that after a few months we were gonna get back to our lives which he agreed to. Today he sprung on us his \"plans\" for us. He decided to take business to next level and expand to another city and we have to manage the other side of the business here while he's gone while also taking care of my husbands older sister so she can go to college here.Keep in mind, my father in law is a healthy and young man so that's not a factor and all this time he's been making lots of money but he either doesn't pay my husband for the job or underpays him.We are not getting any younger and I feel like if we do what he wants we are gonna be stuck forever doing evervthing he says. Also I'm done seeing my husband suffer through this. He doesn't get days off or vacation or even money enough to survive. So AlTA for thinking this way?!",

She asked me what I was doing today and I explained that I would be having friends over for dinner this evening, she asked if she stayed out “too late” for lunch if I would let her dog out. I assumed because she was leaving at 11:30 for lunch at 12:30 that her version of late was 3:30-4. At 5 o’clock she texted me and asked if I would go over and walk her dog to pee. I explained that my guests were already here and that I had assumed she was already home. At this point my exclusive BF baby was also hungry but I didn’t say that. She blew up on me saying that I was supposed to be responsible for her dog and that she was depending on me. I explained to her that I couldn’t just leave my guests and that I figured she was already home when she didn’t text me earlier. She hung up on me then texted me a few minutes later saying “ You know, I always thought that you would have my back if I needed you because nobody else does so” and I said “I’m sorry that you feel that way, I’ve come to let her out quite a few times when it was last minute.

	"title" : "AITA for bringing my issues with my Roomate to housing",
	"body" : "AITA So to summarize the situation that me (S) and roommate F have been having issues with another roommate (B). Originally, there were was a fourth roommate, but she moved out over winter break but she was not factor in this situation. Since the first month of the school year B has been constantly leaving her stuff in the common areas and making a mess in the kitchen after cooking or baking sometimes at random times of the night, and will usually not clean it up for days. This has led to a bug problems that F and I have both tried to discuss with B, but she seemed to not care. This is especially frustrating to F and I as we both do not have good histories with bugs. F and I have tried several times to explain to her how the mess is affecting us mentally and physically. (Neither of us feel welcome in our own apartment because of her) Additionally she consistently has 1-2 friends over unannounced almost everyday usually until late at night, which was frustrating for me as I had early classes. It also made me and F feel like we can not use the living room and kitchen while they were in there as they never hang out in her room. For a whole semester we have tried to explain and compromise on the use of the whole kitchen and living room area, and she still has not changed. We have been reluctant to go to housing as B works for our schools housing department and we did not want to possibly affect her job, but we feel like the issues between the three of us have been dismissed because she thinks we will not take an actions against her. However after recent comments made about our “lack” of assistance cleaning the common areas (including the living room and dining table which F and I have used maybe twice since the beginning of the school year) We have decided that the best course of action is to put the situation into someone else’s hands as we feel like none of our attempts have worked. So we have reached out to housing to try and get any sort of action to be taken to improve the living situation between the three of us. To complete summarize this post the question F and I have is are we the assholes for potentially affecting B’s job and bringing this situation to housing.Edit: I’d just like to apologize in advance as this is my first time posting and I’m not familiar with it. I wanted to clarify a few questions I saw, B, F, and I live in an apartment style dorm where B is our buildings RA (hence our reluctance to go to housing as the next step up would be her boss). We each have our own bedrooms but share a common room and kitchen which is where the issues are occurring, B has completely taken over the common area with her things and occupies most of the kitchen: When she has friends over, they are in the kitchen and living room which are open to each other and act as a hallway to the bedrooms. This means when there are people in the common areas you can hear them especially movies and games which is usually what B and her friends due. I hope this clears a few things up and again I apologize if there are any mistakes.",

Cole’s school admins make all the kids’ guardians/caretakers join a group chat so we can advise one another, decide on some minor rule or policy adjustments or plan events and many other things. There are 20 kids in the class and about 25 people in the group chat including me and Mia. I joined the group about 2 months ago.I introduced myself as Cole’s great aunt and received a warm welcome. They were about to plan a volunteer work for the kids for new year as was the school tradition and they were in the middle of deciding the activities. I offered my suggestion. A few days later the group tallied all the activity options and mine and another parent, Eva’s, were the top two. I told everyone my activity was simple and did not require too much preparation. Eva agreed we would do my activity. We then split what we each would do.The first day I met anyone from the group chat was the day of the volunteer. Everyone was amazed when they learn I was Cole’s great aunt. They said they didn’t realize I was so young. Eva seemed a little displeased but I didn’t think much of it until the volunteering was over. It was a success.Eva approached me after that and said she was blindsided. The reason she agreed to my volunteer activity was because she thought I was older and not in good physical condition. As her activity was more physically demanding, she felt guilty putting an older person through it and so agreed with my activity. She said it was not cool of me to let people believe I am older than I actually am because with age comes respect and concern and I don’t deserve them as a much younger person.I didn’t think age will play such a role in the group.

I need some money so I offered some tutoring classes for people( I don't have students at all so I don't have the best luck with it). My uncle's wife has like two kids in school ( the spoiled kind that my grandparents worship) and she said she wanted my help to teach them English and I agreed. I normally take for the class 18 dollars ( not much but people are not welling to pay shit) but my uncle's wife said she wanted the class for 2 dollars!!!! I agreed and said okay keep in mind I also teach Arabic to foreigners, I volunteer and study at the same time ( it doesn't gain me much money that I really need rn but oh well) regardless of how tight my time is I agreed for the 2 dollars class that my uncle's wife asked of me ( money is money). I gave her firstly like two months ago like 5 classes which weren't paid for although it's so cheap and my cousin is such a trouble!!she doesn't know how to tell between b and d she's that bad!.

	"body" : "I (F18) am in a typical friend group of 6(also all F18), and we’ve been best friends for the past 2 years. Obviously we’re all in our last year of school so we don’t want any unnecessary drama or stress so we barely ever argue. Anyway for context I have dyed red hair, and to maintain the colour I have to use red shampoo, red conditioner, a red hair mask and to wash it under cold water. It’s tedious and my hairstylist also told me not to wash my hair too many times to maintain the colour. My hair is also extremely damaged so washing it too much would probably make me bald and that’s unfortunately not the look I’m going for, so I only wash it twice a week, and so I have an everything shower every time I wash my hair, kind of to kill two birds with one stone. Some of my friends find it disgusting, and keep telling me to wash it even though I’ve explained over and over again that it’s super hard to do that and I don’t want to end up balding or with fading hair, and they keep making jokes about how they can fry eggs in my hair and all that. I normally just laugh it off but it’s gotten so repetitive that laughing it off becomes an acquired skill that I have not mastered. They’re making me seem like this greasy slimeball monster but it’s not even like I’m unhygienic, I brush my teeth every morning and every night, shower at least once every day and never ever skip my morning and evening skincare routine, and the worst thing is that they’re always making these jokes in public at the top of their voices. So anyway the last two weeks were mocks week, and naturally my tedious everything shower routine wasn’t really a priority, and I had to show up to school bare-faced w greasy hair every day which was actually painful for me. All I did today was tell my friends that I was excited to be wearing makeup and pretty clothes to school for the first time in two weeks and finally looking like the cute hyper feminine girly girl I am and they’ve just hit me with a barrage of insults about how I’m so scary and how I can’t be feminine with my unwashed hair because apparently you have to wash your hair every single day. I literally know what to do when there’s grease in my hair, I always style it into a slick bun or any other cute hairstyle that I’ve always thought I look good in but the fact that I don’t wash my hair every day suddenly makes me look like a bloodied goat to the slaughter shitting fear diarrhoea everywhere with matted fur and a single dangly earring. They said I was and I quote, “disgusting” and “scary”, so I just explained that my hair stylist told me not to wash my hair more than twice a week, and they said that “[I] don’t need a licensed doctor or stylist to tell me to wash my hair every day”, so I just went off on them and told them that jokes are funny, but I’d appreciate it if they were at least doing it in a way that made me think they were minding their own business and not making me feel so ugly and so dirty and unfeminine. Am I the asshole for responding the way I did? ALSO, if it’s any solace to anyone, I’m typing this with WASHED hair!! and I’m planning on washing it again before school on Monday! edit: OKAY just wanted to clarify, my hair is nowhere near the point where it’s so damaged i need to cut or shave it, it’s not thin, it’s really thick, it’s not frizzy and it has improved since i started washing it this way! its not very healthy but it is smooth, once again thick and it is moisturised! it’s mostly to maintain the colour but tysm for the concern. it’s not fried at all, it was when i got a chemical perm done years ago in korea, and that took a lot of repairing, even chopped half my hair off that time to recover. it’s longer and healthier now! i’m only listening to my stylist but again tysm for all your concerns once again my hair is NORMAL, it’s not dead at all, but it could be if i don’t take care of it properly, im also just lazy i was just really really really mad when i was typing this so i was exaggerating the condition of my hair by a lot in the heat of the moment! my hair is as damaged as colour treated hair inevitably gets! i get regular hair treatments after colour every salon visit (tokio inkarami n olaplex) <3333",

Anyways, I was feeling very stuffy in my parents house, I am the oldest daughter of two siblings (brother & sister), and both of my parents are in the picture. We also have 4 dogs and 2 cats. So my house was always packed.I always felt like I was cleaning up after everyone, catering to their emotional needs especially my moms, and I didn’t feel like I was at home at all. Now I feel very comfortable in my home, and we’re looking to get a new place that’s a bit smaller to downsize- but overall I feel comfortable and confident about my situation and plan.My mom keeps telling me I’m abandoning my family and that I need to be in my siblings lives- which I really do try to attend every event I can, But I also have two jobs so my time can be stretched pretty thin. She gets mad if I don’t go to her for advice or tell her things, and she will yell at me every time my dad calls me to tell me hi. She also won’t stop trying to get my to move back in. We also have the two cats who don’t get along with one of our dogs, and I ended up taking them as they need a home feel safe in, so them moving back wouldn’t be preferred.My bf and I are the ones downsizing as my friend is moving to her home state. He and I have found a few places within our budget and location preferences- and I showed my mom and she just said “you and ‘bf name’ can just move in with us to save money, I don’t think getting another place is smart” . We both have full time jobs and steady incomes, but when I say we don’t need to do that she gets mad at me and just says that she thinks it’s a bad idea and that I need to be saving more money, which is fair, but I’m doing okay for myself. I don’t really know how to talk to her anymore because when I do she just brings up me moving back home even though I do not need to at all- and then she starts to yell at me and talk down to me  if I don’t agree with her opinion.AITA for not moving back into my parents house?",

My older brother (31m) has been battling addiction since I was very young.A few months ago my parents were out of town and I had agreed to water the plants once a week while their neighbor grabbed their mail daily. One of the times I was there to water the plants I found my brother high in the basement. He had broken in knowing they were out of town and not thinking I would go down to the basement at all. The basement locks from the outside so he was not able to get into the rest of the house.I left after asking him  if I could get him some help and him refusing and called my parents. They made the decision to call the cops and I was put in the position of having to let them into my parents house. He left before they got there and I made sure all the doors and windows were locked, but my mom guilted me into continuing to water the plants the next couple weeks as they would die if no one did. The next time I came back all of the stuff my brother had brought into the basement was gone indicating he was still able to enter the building, and I found one of the windows unlocked again. The time after that the washer was on, so I knew he had come back a third time. My brother ended up telling my parents he knew how to open that window from outside. But my parents wouldn't come home or do anything about the window. My partner ended up watering the plants the rest of the time my parents were gone because my anxiety was so high.Flash forward to the other day, my parents were going to be gone for a long weekend and my mom asked me if I could bring in the mail on my way home from work one day and they'd ask the neighbors to do so the rest of the week. I said no because I still have a lot of trauma from the last time and did not feel comfortable.Meanwhile, my city is going through an extreme weather event and a lot of people are losing power, I asked my mom if my power went out if I could crash at their place, as it is nigh impossible to get anywhere with how much ice there is, and I have a senior cat with serious medical issues, and I do not think he would be safe without heat.My mom said yes, then later expressed how upset she was with me that I wouldn't do something she viewed as super simple and easy, the window has now been fixed so he can't get back in that way, and that she thinks it's clear I can control my anxiety when I need to.I feel like bringing in the mail when someone else can easily get it and finding a warm place to stay during a storm are very different things, but maybe I should have just sucked it up and brought their mail in even though even thinking about it was causing me extreme amounts of anxiety. AITA?Editing to add: The idea of sleeping there does give me a ton of anxiety, and I'm very very grateful the power has not gone out and I have not had to do that.",

This has expanded to include the spouses/partners of many forum members.I also have a history of trying to be the best friend I can. However that has led me to get letdown in my life by people who take and never give back.We have 3 friends all relevant. Lets call them Tina, Dave and Jorge. Tina and Dave are married, Jorge is single. Tina and Jorge were members of the forum, Dave wasn't. All have been to our home multiple times for different events. Jorge, Dave and I especially became tight while Tina and my wife were really close.Dave had confided in me that he was unhappy in his marriage, he had a dead bedroom and was feeling very unappreciated. We spoke at length about communication skills and methods to help make things better. Over the course of 2-3 years we spoke about this every time we were together.One day just before Christmas at 9pm my wife had a phonecall, immediately it was obvious something bad had happened. It turned out Dave had given Tina an STI. Neither of them she thought had EVER had another partner and it turned out when she confronted him that he had been having an affair for years and had even hidden several others from earlier in their marriage.I immediately called him to support. I attempted to calm him down, take time and allow the two of them to get the help they needed to decide what to do. They have grown children and were due to have Christmas together, this was now not an option so we opened our home to them and they came for Christmas, spent a week in our home and we talked at length as a group and individually. They decided they wanted to work things out and we, of course, offered our help. We were there for many late night chats and did everything we could.They moved across country he changed job (the affair was with a colleague) and had a fresh start.Two years later my wife was having a tough time, anxiety and depression took a hold and she was really struggling. For her birthday I arranged for all of her friends to record a short video of why they loved her and what they admired about her, i had over 60 videos that made a 90 min gift for her. Tina, Dave and Jorge were going to come for a small dinner at our home. Everything was arranged, the visit was a surprise for my wife. I also told the 3 of them that I needed help as i was struggling to hold things together while my wife struggled.1 day before arrival Tina and Dave bailed- no explanation just \"we cant make it\"- i asked at the least could they record a video, they said yes but never did.No apology, no explanation, they also left Jorge with a rental car cost.They have now (dec 2023) resurfaced and said they want to rekindle things, again no apology or acknowledgment of things, just \"Hey we miss getting together lets do it\" So AITA for not wanting to open up to this again?",

My father lost his job for a period of 1.5 years, but he has since found employment. He has also been struggling with alcohol and depression. My mother is a textbook narcissist.My mother asked me to take a loan out for college and have my father cosign for it. My father will not cosign for the loan because he does not want to incur the debt, as he says that we can afford it without the loan. They refuse to speak to each other and have been communicating through me. My mother has also done some things that ruined my credit, and I would be paying double the interest rate without a cosigner.When my mom first brought up the loan, my father's first reaction was that she had no intention of repaying and that he would not let that happen. I asked her point blank, and she said that they intended to pay it back. I also had options to graduate early or have a full ride to a less notable school, which my mom refused because she thought it would be embarrassing.My mother is manipulative. She has also told me that if I do not make my father give her what she wants in the divorce, she will disown me. One situation where I saw this point blank was when I refused to take off work to go on vacation because I had an important meeting. She called me and told me that my father was going to hurt her. I immediately came home and had resources available to get her out, but she acted like I was crazy, telling me that I was stupid for not knowing that it wasn't actually true. She then asked me if I was packed for vacation.So when the issue of the loan came up again today (the day before I left for college), she started crying and telling me that she had nobody on her side. She told me that I was selfish because I had not already offered to pay for tuition. She then told me she was going to drain all of their accounts before the next tuition payment comes, and under no circumstance was I supposed to tell my father about any of this.I'm not against contributing to my own education. I am upset because this was her intention all along. I had several options that could have prevented this situation, but she lied.I have tried to be neutral in all of this to preserve my relationship with both parents, but I think I fucked up. I told my father what my mother said because I knew he would at least keep the next check from bouncing, and he would cover tuition. I know it was manipulative of me to go behind my mother's back. College is a privilege, and I feel like a spoiled brat running to my father. But it’s his finances, too, so maybe it’s okay to keep him in the loop?",

He said it happend two years ago but it didn’t matter and they never dated. Neither of them cared to tell me about this. So I went asking around to make sure I wasn’t overreacting but apparently everyone knew but me, becaues they knew I’d be upset. Jenda even said to someone “she doesn’t know becaues she’ll make him block me.” And I heard from someone else that they really liked each other back then. But even though I was friends with Jenda back then she never told me about him. But they did date, even though he said they didn’t. For awhile undercover since she was cheating on her boyfriend with him. They never hung out or did anything beyond inappropriate pictures to eachother.

So let me know if I’m in the wrong for lashing out.Edit:I forgot to add something important!

We all help each other with chores to spread the load, but these last two weeks, he hadn't had a day off (I'm talking 13 days straight).

During this, they were trying to get their endurance/stamina up due to all of the walking that would be involved for both trips. This was also encouraged by their parents as well as they know it’s tough for them to walk or stay on their feet. I could see they were working really hard but as soon as we went to the amusement park they had a very difficult time and needing a lot of breaks. Which I totally understand, but they were not having a great time and had a hanging face and told me they wanted to go back to the room. I even mentioned to them that I would go on by myself so that they can either go back or meet up with their parents who were at the park. I had spent so much money and rearranged my schedule while also doubling up on completing hw just so I can attend. It Another point to add is that they complain constantly on the same things for every trip like how hot/sweaty, uncomfortable, or how much they hurt. It was hot for the most part but they complain to the point of making everyone else miserable because of how they feel.

	"body" : "TL;DR: I (F24) have recently found out that my father (M60) has been struggling with alcoholism for a year. Tried to help him once, but failed. Chose to quit the attempts at helping him for the sake of my own mental wellbeing.My (F24) parents (F64, M60) have been divorced for 12 years now, and I've been living with my mother and brother (M22). Before the divorce, I was very close with my father. After he moved out, however, he slowly detached himself and reduced our communication to a single phone call once every couple of months.Recently, I found out he has been struggling with an alcohol addiction for the past year, following a break-up with a woman he loved (they've been together for 7 years). I knew something was off, but he convinced me everything was alright with him and that he was just very busy at work (he did have a stressful job). I found out the truth through his colleagues when they reached out to me a month ago.I immediately reached out to my father when I found out. By that point, he was in the middle of his third relapse and has been drinking non-stop for a month. I arranged a week-long stay at a specialized hospital to get him started with detox and psychotherapy along with the rest of the required treatment. He refused to go at the very last moment. Refused any other help I offered.My mother reached out to him, offering help, but the horrible things he said to her drove her to tears. My brother didn't want to help from the beginning.Since I reached out, my father has been able to pull himself together and stayed sober for two weeks, only to then fall back into relapse. He's been lying to me about catching the flu. He's been lying a lot, about many things, as alcoholics tend to often do, to keep me from visiting him and from finding out he's been drinking again.With this relapse, his colleagues and friends have all been calling and texting me, asking me to help him. Telling me what to do, how to talk to him, criticizing my actions. None have offered to actually help. My mother has been pushing me to dedicate my upcoming week-long vacation to my father's health.I have been dealing with mild depression and anxiety for a long while, and it got worse when I found out about my father's alcoholism. I am now being pressured into dealing with this issue all on my own, yet I feel like I cannot deal with it without breaking down.

	"title" : "AITA for being frustrated that my dad treats his step kids better",
	"body" : "So, to give some context, My parents have been divorced since I was around 6 years old (I am 20 now). And my dad has been married to my stepmom for over a decade at this point. And don’t get me wrong, my stepmom is a wonderful women who always has made sure I’m safe and healthy. However throughout the years, I’ve felt second best to the step kids. Growing up my dad wasn’t very present in my life, I would go over to his house every so often and hang out, but even then, we would go to his step kids events. Their football games, their marching band performances, their track meets. Sure I didn’t have to many after school activities to attend, but even on the rare occasions I did, he still went to their events. Even at my highschool graduation dinner, I was spoken to twice. They continuously asked my stepbrother what his plans for college were(we are in the same grade, he already had his graduation dinner), got my other stepbrothers favorite dessert(I got what was left when he was done), and played with my stepsisters baby. I tried not to think about it to much and wrote it off as me being to self centered. Then I went to college, and even still, their focus was on my the younger brothers football games, the grandkids, and the other brothers marching bands. They travel hours for them. I asked him at the end of my freshman year to come to a showing of my department where they would show off everything I had been working on this year(bear in mind, I hadn’t asked him for anything this year and this was my first school event where we invite our families). However, he told me that he wouldn’t be able to make it because he was going to my stepbrothers marching band performance that’s 6 hours away(my school is less then 20 minutes from them). Then came my birthday, the last straw. My dad texted me 2 days before and asked if I wanted to go out to eat for my birthday, I said yes and 2 days later, I meet them at the restaurant with my actual brother. When we get there, we put our names on the list and wait for our table to be ready. While we’re waiting, my dad and stepmom put on a football game on their phones because, my stepbrother is at a real game and they might show them on the TV screen. This goes on throughout the entire dinner, where, just like my graduation dinner, I’m spoken to twice(I didn’t even get to finish speaking the second time because my stepbrother showed up on the screen and they flipped out in front of the waiter, claiming, “sorry, we just saw our son on TV” then proceeded to talk about him for the next 45 minutes. Afterwards we gave hugs and left. My brother asked how I enjoyed the dinner and I said I didn’t. Two days later my dad texts me saying I need to communicate that I’m upset and that it’s hard to make everyone happy and that he’s trying his best. I have a fake “it’s ok” speech, but it’s still eating me up hat no matter what, I’m always second best to his new family. AITA",

She had a tinder and was talking to multiple people, which is fine, however she found out she was pregnant not long after. There are 3 or 4 guys I know she was hooking up with during the time she should have gotten pregnant (I calculated this based on her official due date). She told her ex boyfriend and claims it is his and I don’t think he has any idea she has been hooking up with other people. I asked her if she’s sure it is his and she said yes, but she can’t possibly know that. I don’t think he was even around during that week of conception, but could be wrong. Even if they did, there’s still a chance it’s not his. They also were together for years without getting pregnant and did nothing at all to prevent pregnancy so she said in the past she thought she was infertile. Now I’m wondering if maybe he is the one that can’t have kids. It has been weighing on me as I am the only person that knows this information. I don’t want to go behind her back and tell him and leave her in a bad situation as she currently has no car or job and relies on him to get where she needs to go but it’s still pretty fucked up to me that she wasn’t honest and didn’t think to do a DNA first. Maybe she is scared or clueless I don’t know. I asked my mom what she thinks I should do and she said to mind my own business and hopefully if it’s not his the truth will come to light. I have severe anxiety and confrontation does not come easy to me. I was thinking of sending an anonymous message to him but don’t know what to say or how to do that.

Friend is a very loose term-they live out of state and I rarely see/speak to them anymore, literally haven’t spoken to them in about a year recently. I got married 2 years ago and decided to have her in my wedding solely because she asked me to be in theirs about 4 years ago (their wedding has been pushed off due to covid). I have never liked her fiancé and the majority of all our mutual friends dislike him as well. He’s a cheater, liar, and I recently found out, abusive. I confronted my friend about this a few years ago and she broke down and told me it was true. I tried to get her out of the relationship by offering her to stay at my place for free for as long as she needed. She told me he was aware of his bad behavior and that he promised her he was going to change, stop drinking so much, etc. My heart broke for her. But I realized I was helpless in the situation and she was going to do what she wanted regardless.Fast forward to a few months ago, she texts me saying that they have set a date for their wedding. She knows things aren’t well between me and her fiancé (he knows I know and I refuse to be around him-he was not allowed at my wedding) so she expressed how she would still like me there regardless of the situation. Initially I was going to say yes of course I can put a smile on my face and pretend I approve of the wedding. But the more I thought about it: I realized I would be highly uncomfortable there, I didn’t want her to worry about my presence causing any issues on the happiest day of her life, and honestly I didn’t trust her fiancé not to cause a scene with me once he had a few drinks. So after much thought, I politely declined saying I didn’t think it was a good idea for me to be there and I wished her the best of luck and I hoped her day was perfect. She responded saying that it was probably for the best that I hung back and she completely understood. Also, I should mention I obviously was demoted from bridesmaid to wedding guest-which she never outright said but I figured out myself.AITA?

Here's where I think I might be the AH though:2 years ago, on Christmas, my brother (let's call him M) and sister (going to go with P) were with my mom, and I had just finished a long shift at work. I called P and asked where they were, and she said her house, which was about a 35 minute drive from where I was. I said ok, went out, and all the lights were off, so I called to have them let me in. P said I wasn't outside, which...yes, I am? P then asked which house I was at, and when I said hers, she laughed and said they were at my mom's house, that she can't believe I went to her place. I hung up and haven't talked to her since. (For context, my mom lives an additional 45 minutes away from my sister, so it would have been an even longer drive.)For the longest time, I held both siblings accountable for hurting my feelings, but ultimately, I realize M didn't do anything, but he was always pretty insufferable growing up, and did some awful shit that I don't feel right forgiving him for anyway. So I don't feel terrible about not inviting him because frankly he wouldn't care either. But I'll be civil with him if I have to be around him.I still feel hurt that my sister hasn't apologized about it yet, and through my mother I've heard she feels like she shouldn't apologize. I even attempted to have the message relayed through my mom to my sister about me talking to her because I want my nephew to be my best man - I love him to death. To know he won't be there is devastating to me because he was my little buddy growing up and is becoming such a cool person. But P thinks I'm only reaching out because I want her to do my hair at the wedding, which she refuses to do, and I really couldn't care less if she did or not.I have decided to just not invite either of them to avoid any drama altogether, but my mom said she's upset that they won't be there.

I usually have about 30-60 minutes of homework every evening before A days. Also, my family has no designated “family time” and never has.It was Sunday night, and my family (dad, stepmom, stepsis) and I were watching the Obi Wan Kenobi star wars series, and had watched 2 episodes (a little over an hour of time) consecutively while/after eating dinner. After the 2nd episode, my dad turned off the TV (around 9pm), at which point I said I had homework to do, and went to my bedroom.Just shortly after doing so, I heard my stepmom practically yelling at my dad over her feeling like she was being ignored and her time not taken seriously. I also heard her saying that my dad should put me on a stricter homework schedule, regardless that I am a straight-A student (a point my dad brought up throughout their argument). My dad also said several times that “if this is how he (me) wants to manage his time, I can’t stop that”. My stepmom continued to argue, and state that she was extremely frustrated. My dad tried his best to diffuse the situation while still defending my decisions.After about 10 minutes of arguing, my dad eventually comes to my room and tells me to communicate with them about homework better, to which I said that I have always done this on Sundays when I have math the next day. He seemed like he agreed with my reasoning, but still just asked me nicely to communicate better in the future. I said that I would.I had completely finished my homework by 10pm, and had time to watch more star wars, but when I asked my stepmom, she acted cold towards me and was visibly angry. She ended up going to bed shortly after, and barely talked to my dad.She has started talking to me again, but I still feel like she’s giving me the cold shoulder, which I feel is silly for something like this, especially when she never even talked to me directly about it.TLDR: I did homework during “family time”, and my stepmom got extremely angry at my dad and I.AITA?",

My dad did some bad things family-wise a few years ago that have definitely stuck with me, but he has made up for it and has sorted his own issues out, and hasn't messed up since. I have also started my own (very) successful side hustle/business but have not told any of my parents (feel like I am not ready to yet), so ontop of school and upcoming finals my free time is very limited.On with the story, a few months later and a couple thousand in profit later and things are going good, but as of a few months ago it is all he ever talks about. And these aren't in-depth conversations he is trying to make, IMO it's the most useless, mind numbing convo, he will talk about the same thing for sometimes hours, he will repeatedly ask me to do the most basic things that he never even tries to do himself (even if I am busy/ill). If you nod/say yes instead of giving a detailed sentence as a reply, he will keep asking you again and again until you either cut him off repeatedly, say it loud, or give a full detailed essay as a reply. I vividly remember being sat down getting on the game and being on call with friends openly speaking, and then he came into my room, sat down, and talked for literally 2 hours about the same 2 things literally more than 10 times whilst you could literally see the game going on my screen. This is all he ever talks about, literally nothing we ever speak about is about anything else, it's all \"business\". I feel like he does not know how to receive the message of \"just leave me alone, I will help when I can/when stuff actually needs to be done\". I also feel like he thinks that after I am finished with school that I will just drop everything and help him out with what is essentially a side hustle full time, or at least go into further studies about something heavily related to it. It has gotten to the point where I literally dread him sitting in my room, as I know I am about to sit through what (I feel like) is going to be a minimum 20 minute convo about stuff that you could probably come to a conclusion on in 2 minutes.EDIT: messed up judgement bot - this is why i feel like I am the asshole: The reason I'm wondering if I am an asshole is because I've literally started to physically avoid now, whenever he sits in my room sometimes I'll \"get up for a glass of water\", or when he tries to talk to me in the living room I'll be \"going to eat in the dining room\" (sometimes this is actually the case).

I snapped out in anger and yelled which I’ve never done before, and threw a water bottle on the floor next to them although not targeting them. My mom pulled my brother and said to give me some space and yet my older brother was still insisting on staying to “help” although I said a million times all I need is some space by myself. I feel so terrible because I’ve never reacted this way in my life but I feel like I had no choice to set my boundaries otherwise. I kept explaining over and ove that I just want to be by myself for now and they refused to listen. I feel so bad and frustrated. I hate yelling so much it’s never been my thing. I’ve always wanted a partner but I was constantly worried about having issues that I don’t know about and one day snapping out like I did today. In fact I really really needed a partner for a long time, I literally don’t have anyone to talk to. I don’t want to vent on them but just someone who I can talk to normally and emotionally if that makes sense.",

	"body" : "Hubby and I have been married 5 years. We have a 4yr old and 2yr old.He used to work full time and crazy hours especially during tax season, but was miserable so we decided he should use GI Bill to take classes full-time to get a bachelor's degree and then get a different job. He takes classes online and watches the kids while I'm at workI work M-F and am gone 8:30-12:30. The rest of the time I'm just on call. We live off my income but he does get money from the GI Bill and has partial disability from the army, so he does contribute financially. But there is no way we'd survive even a month without me working.We split the house responsiblies pretty evenly and he's really good about most of it. We have one area of contention - the laundry.I am happy to fold, hang, and put away all laundry. But I want it all done on Monday so I don't have to deal with it the rest of the week. So all I ask is all laundry be washed and in baskets by the time I get home on Monday at 12:30. I know this is possible to do, because when he was working full time, I did it everyday Saturday morning. Started laundry around 8am, and had everything washed before noon.But for some reason my husband cannot get it done on time. He loses track of time and never rotates anything, so when I get home it is a miracle if two of the four small loads are ready for me to fold/sort/hang. He has even started laundry on Sunday nights to try to get it done on time.....still no change. (Twice he actually HAS accomplished this, so yes it IS possible when he makes the effort to pay attention to timing.) But every Monday I end up upset because now I will have to do a load of laundry each day to keep up with everything. I'm so sick of it and I hate being mad at him for it.So, yesterday, when it happened again for the hundredth time, I told him from now on, I will keep my clothes separate, and he will be responsible for washing, folding, and putting away all other laundry, including our kids'. This way he can do it at his own pace and I don't have to worry about it and I'm no longer dependent on him doing his part.He's upset, saying I don't appreciate how hard he tries, and I only focus on the bad things etc. But the truth is I'm just tired of being disappointed and upset. I don't want to be angry every single Monday afternoon. So this is my solutionSo...AITA?Edited to add- I don't care HOW he does it or when. All loads are already sorted out. He could do a load every other day all week and then I just put them all away on Monday. IDGAF how it gets done. But if he wants ME to fold/sort/put away all the laundry, I just ask it be ready on Monday afternoon because it's the only free afternoon I have all week. Otherwise I have to shuffle other things around or stay up late after kids are on bed to do it.",

He introduced me to my now boyfriend 6 years ago who is a childhood friend of his. Sawyer and I used to be closer than he was to my boyfriend.The breakdown of our friendship started when I switched jobs and moved to a different city. I still tried my best to keep our friendship intact by always keeping him updated with my life, letting him hang out with me and my boyfriend even when we wanted alone time (we live 2 hours away so could only meet once a week), etc. Sawyer also used to take initiative initially. However, 2 years ago he started dating an extremely toxic woman, they got engaged but eventually broke up. I was never a fan of hers and let him know that (I was never rude about it but felt like I needed to speak up because she was making him miserable). That’s when he started really distancing himself. So I backed off as well. I still tried to maintain a healthy friendship, but he kept disappointing me by missing my birthdays and other important events, etc. One instance that really hurt me was when I was in his city for some work and had a few hours to kill, I asked if I could come to his house, but he declined because he was with his girl (they didn’t live together but got enough alone time with each other on a daily basis). So I had to spend 3 hours at a cafe alone.Overall, it didn’t seem like he was completely trying to cut me off because he would RSVP yes for events and even show excitement, but would not show up for underwhelming reasons (like he was out shopping with his girlfriend). Anyway, gradually I stopped making an effort with him. He didn’t tell me when they got engaged and when they eventually broke up.Since they broke up, we’ve tried to mend our friendship, although we never explicitly addressed the past. He got fired from his job last week and again didn’t tell me (I get updated on these things through my boyfriend who lives close to him so they keep more in touch). While I feel bad for him and want to reach out, I can’t help but feel that I’m no longer an important part of his life and he doesn’t need my support anyway. AITA?",

I’ve struggled this last year, because mum duties have taken over work stuff. I’ve really had to wreck my business to keep my head above water with caring for the kids.My husband has always been a bit of a workaholic, but is currently getting really stressed with the pressure of earning enough money. We both run our own businesses. I’m keen to get my work back on track and stop him having to work so many hours, but that would entail him being able to commit to an afternoon of childcare a week and he won’t because he admits he would prioritise work if something went wrong, which would leave me having to cancel clients at the last minute.There is a three day conference coming up that I really want to go to. I’ve wanted to go for years, but it just hasn’t been possible. I initially asked in the family chat (his side of the family) if they felt between them they could cover three days. Everyone said yes.Then my husband found out that the event allows families to attend. Not the lectures etc. but to be on site. He wants to do that. I know partially so he can have a little holiday and spend time with the kids, but he admits also so he doesn’t have to do bedtime alone. He has never had all three alone for more than an hour or so. Not even sure he’s had the older two for a whole day without getting his parents to help.If he comes with, he’ll have three full days of childcare alone, but I’ll be there for bedtimes (though that will probably mean missing the social stuff in the evenings as bedtime might be prolonged away from home). If he stays home, he can have help any of the days and potentially the evenings too. Downside of staying home is that my parents may try to take over, which he rightly hates.Probably selfishly; I want a break. I have the full mental load with the kids. I’m trying to work and run a household. I’m hugely lucky we have my in-laws close. My parents are trickier, but they live with us and can be helpful. We can afford nursery one day a week. Any child free hours are spent either desperately trying to catch up on work or household stuff. A three day conference on my own sounds like bliss.WIBTA if I say I want to go alone?ETA: I think I’ve made him sound less competent than he is. He regularly has 1 or 2 of the kids for up to half a day. Just not all three. He used to do bedtime for the older two, but when I went back to doing some evenings after the 3rd was born, trying to do bedtime with a breastfed baby was too much. I dropped my evening work and it’s just become habit for me to do bedtime most of the time. He comes up if he’s back in time.UPDATE: I told him I’m booking it just for me, because I would have to miss out on the evening parts of the conference and because he would get more help at home. He immediately got angry, but I didn’t back down. As expected he threatened to work two of the days. I’ll organise his parents to have them both those days and overnight.

Every time I mention it to her or try to convince her to go sleep in her room she starts to cry and get physically upset. She says she’s tried to sleep in her room but I haven’t heard her go in there or even lay down.I dont want to be mean to my Mom but I also don’t like having my space invaded and feeling like I can’t tell her no.What do I do?",

So the time came when my SIL (38f) who I get along with very well was planning my baby shower for June after lockdown restrictions had eased up and originally it was going to be only women invited. After my partner asked if we could have a joint one instead which was totally fine except now the two exes would have to see each other (also fine I had thought).Unbeknownst to us my BIL had started to see someone else closer to the time of the baby shower (it had been about 2 weeks at the time of my baby shower) which is where the problem for comes. He had asked my MIL(64f) and SIL if he could bring her and they mentioned it to my husband and I and we both said no, it's not the appropriate or right time. He seemed to accept that and then said he would bring her the next weekend when we were moving house and again we said no, not the right time.Come to the morning of the shower and I am getting my makeup done by my friends as gift and my husband gets a phone call and I could tell by him going into another room and his tone what it was about. His brother had shown up to the venue before anybody else with the NEW gf (also 42f). I was so livid and close to tears and it made me feel like not going to my own baby shower. My MIL had told SIL to not say anything and just keep quiet. When I arrived I was still in shock and it was awkward meeting them to say the least. I avoided them as much as possible.My MIL had also invited a cousin (m) and his wife because they had helped my FIL during the pandemic with advice and such which I was also against but she pleaded with my husband so we just said yes to them.I just felt completely disrespected and that me saying no didn't count for anything at all.It had eventually come out the problems they caused but they don't see that they did anything wrong and I was told only recently that she didn't actually want to come but it was BIL who said that he wanted her there.Side note: He also at my birthday dinner a few months later chose that time to ask his brothers to be his groomsmen because \"it's hard getting everyone all together at the same time\" which also had me fuming.Sorry this post was waay longer than I expected",

I am a 31(m)who lives alone in the same apartment building as them but I have my own apartment. I work full time and have my own life and relationships and friendships. I told  family from the start that I am not against the girl moving in, wish her the best but don’t expect me to go out of my way to attend to her and to specially not try to push any type of relationship between her and me.I also have been with my current girlfriend for 4 years. My mother highly dislikes her because my mother says that my girlfriend has not gone out of her way to win over my mothers respect and my mother is an old school Hispanic lady who has a very different mindset. My girlfriend is a medical cannabis patient so my mother thinks she is the devil for legally consuming marijuana.The girl who moved in is a nice girl and I don’t have anything towards her, I just have 0 interest in forming any type of friendship with her. My family is highly upset and it is causing a major stress in my life and family life because I have 0 interest in becoming friends or being around this girl.

I live in the basement and my roommate (19), we'll call her Sarah, lives on the second floor, with the first floor having the kitchen. When Sarah first moved in with me (I can't pick my roommate as my house is rented by room and not for the whole thing), we never really saw much of each other at home due to conflicting class schedules, but we did work together and were in the same student orgs.Toward the very end of last semester, Sarah started inviting her friends over every night. Whenever I had friends over, which wasn't often and we always stayed in the basement, I would give her a text to make sure it was okay with her. We would do our best to stay quiet so we wouldn't disturb her. When Sarah's friends are over, instead of bringing them up to the second floor where her room is, they all hang out in the kitchen. It's not even every night anymore, it's becoming whenever they're not in class, and I've yet to receive a heads up.My issue isn't that they're really loud and I can hear them from my bedroom. When they get particularly loud, I just put in my earbuds and go back to what I was doing. My issue is that I no longer have access to my food because they're constantly there. I can't make food because there's five to seven of them in a kitchen that barely fits three. On top of that, I have a fear of eating in front of people I'm not comfortable with. Her friends have in the past been extremely unkind to me, and I've walked in on countless conversations about me, as well as my disability.Because my window for food became so small, I ended up having a medical moment in public that almost resulted in an ambulance. After that, I decided enough was enough, and I asked Sarah if she could start hanging out with her friends upstairs, either in her room or in one of the empty (yet still furnished) ones. To that, Sarah got extremely angry and told me things like how I'm a \"dictator who thinks [I] can control everything I see\" and that I only have friends because people pity me.Now, Sarah and her friends are going around telling people that I told her that she's not allowed to have friends over and such like that. One of my friends, we'll call him Nolan, told me that it was rude to tell them they couldn't hang out in the kitchen. I'm just so conflicted because everyone is telling me I'm in the wrong, but I feel like I need to be able to eat more than they need to hang out in that specific room of the 3 floor house.

Their dad is one of my best friends and we have known each other since we were 8 in prep school.This weekend was one of our regular sleepover weekends and the twins arrived after their kids club on Friday night.  We watched The Incredibles (again 12th time) and had a fish and chip supper.Yesterday we went, as we often do to Legoland, but this time my bf(m29) and his son (m7) came with us.  As normal we had a great time and ended up at the cinema to watch Wonka then had supper at my restaurant before heading home.I dropped bf and his son off at his home and took the twins to my home to sleep, then this morning after breakfast we met their parents at church.As normal throughout the weekend we all took photos of the trip and posted them to a private WhatsApp channel for their parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles and me the godparent. The photos included some taken by F-Twin on her phone of bf and I kissing while sharing a chip, and lots of us holding hands as we went around the park.  She did think that me being 'in love' with him was funny and nice and kept asking about when we'd have a wedding and if could she be a bridesmaid.When we got to church my friend's wife was in the atrium waiting and incandescent with rage.  She shouted at me about me taking my bf and his son with us and called me a lot of really unpleasant things mainly relating to being gay.  She was upset that I had had another man she didn't know sleeping in the same house (he didn't) and that I should not have exposed her children to homosexuality!I tried to get her to move to the side room and calm her down but she was having none of it.Given I've been bi for my whole life and up to 4 years ago lived with my then bf who slept in my bed when the twins visited it seems a little off.I guess I popped a little and called her a homophobic bitch and that she should be ashamed of herself.  I have a very booming voice so even when I'm just speaking everyone can hear me, so the room stops.  Our church is mildly LGBT-affirming and has openly gay members, and all of this happened in front of the congregation who were arriving.I left at that point, I couldn't cope with questions as I'm not openly out to everyone.This afternoon my phone exploded with apologies from my friend and fury from his wife.

Helped Richard a lot, teaching, so he could play with me when his character is big enough. I have 6k hours on the game, so i play a lot and know a lot. Teaching take A LOT of time and since Richard doesn't speak english it's kind of harder because everything to learn about the game is in english (outside the game).I honestly think i helped him a lot during this journey.I met June after i decided to make the guild. That's a really nice person and she is a core member of our group. Even if she doesn't play the game like us, she like to craft things, sell, rince and repeat.June stopped playing around november. In december Richard talk to me about this and say we should buy her account because it's valuable. His plan was that i ask her if she's interested in selling it since she doesn't longer play. And if she say yes that we would split everything on the account (he would give me half the money to buy it of course).I ask her, she tell me she stopped playing because of her physical condition. So i tell June that is fine and not to worry about that anymore and i'm glad to have her back. She started playing again.One day she tell me that she won't sell her account and told her that i figured it out and that's not a problem at all.Few weeks goes on. June come to me and say that there is a lot of useless things that she don't use on her account and she could share it to me so i can play it and do whatever i want to manage it. She tell me that i could benefit from her golds and other items directly for my main character. She also add that now she knows she's making golds that goes into my main character that motivated her to even do more.I say yes. I start to play her account, manage things, push her main character so i can do high level dungeon with it. She repeat multiple times to take what i want for myself. So i do. Richard learn from myself about this the same day.In terms of golds + everything i took for myself there is like 1 month of value for me. That is roughly what i would make on my own. That's not a lot but still, very nice to have.I didn't gave anything to my other friend. Since she came to me, told me i could have her account (remember still shared with her so she can basically make golds for me), and didn't wanted any money for it. She's a well grown adult, she is 40, i am past 30, there is no sexual relation or anything like that between us. If she wanted to give my other friend half or something, she would have said something about it or worded things in another way.Well this other friend told me im self centered and ended our friendship.I will add that Richard spend his gold very badly from my point of view. We inherited golds recently from another member and Richard kept making bad decisions about of to spend it.Am i the asshole ?",

Fine, I'll sit there while they all dig in. I'm getting used to it. MIL realizes at the beginning and seems slightly embarrassed - so she offers a few times that she'd be happy to pick up a meal for me across the street. It's a sweet offer, I know she means well, but I know nothing about that restaurant and I can't eat from there either. I turn her down a few times. It was just a shitty experience to sit there while everyone else ate and have to keep turning down an option that was STILL not safe for me. Literally no one's fault, but just innately shitty.It's fine she doesn't remember - lots of people don't. I KNOW she tries and she's the only person in the family who's really responsible for food - whether at restaurants or cooking holiday meals. And that doesn't change the awkward position it puts me in when I have to repeatedly turn down her offers. Like when she planned to bake my potatoes for Christmas dinner in tin foil but then decided to cook it in a contaminated potI am fucking polite. I try to be super kind because my medical needs makes me feel EXTRA and I hate being extra. I have never wanted to put people out and this disease makes me - often in ways that I haven't asked for and that I have to turn down because it's not safe enough.We get home and I commiserate about the awkward position it puts me in.

I talked about how MIL just doesn't get it sometimes, the fact that I can't take up her offers about food.He FLIPS OUT. Tells me I'm calling his mom stupid. I tell him I'm not saying anything about her intelligence or kindness, and if I wanted to talk about stupid we could talk about his brother (who we both agree is just not a nice or caring person) asking if rice, corn, and potatoes had gluten. He mishears and thinks I'm still talking about his mom - calls me a bitch. He tells me that I need to let people know my \"DEMANDS\" and \"RULES\".

It's a shitty life. And I want to talk about how shitty it is with my own partner. He also told me I need to know my limitations for my disease - which I obviously DO.I'm literally sobbing at this point. I explain to him why \"demands\" was a very hurtful word, that I wasn't calling his mom stupid, that I feel incredibly alone which is only exacerbated by him saying all these things to me. He then used the word \"demand\" again, at which point I told him to get the fuck out. He stormed out and now I'm laying bed by myself.AITA?",

I felt like the situation should have been handled differently but wasn't sure what we were doing wrong. Moving forward my husband and I (who have no experience in school sports) will try to have better and more realistic expectations and make proper changes to our interactions with her coach.Just a little background info: my husband and I have a 6th grade daughter (12yo). This is her first year at a small Christian school and she wanted to be involved in sports with her friends. She made their volleyball team and grew a lot during that experience. She also tried out for basketball and made the team. She's never played contact sports and it was a bit of a learning curve for her (and still is) but she tries. Her team has played a few games and she played minimally which she said she was fine with because it was still so new to her.Recently the school got together with a number of other Christian schools to have a tournament on the weekend. My husband was excited to see our daughter play because his work schedule has caused him to miss most of her games so far. Our daughter's school required the players to be at the school where it was taking place (in another town) at 8:30AM for a game at 8:50AM. She played very little. No big deal. She's no Michael Jordan or LeBron James. We understand that she won't be playing a lot because she's still a beginner. Her second game was at 1PM. Yes, several hours later. We watched the whole game. This team was tough, but our daughter's team pulled ahead by 15 points. There was 2 minutes left in the game and our daughter was finally put in. For less than 30 seconds of playing time. I know 30 seconds is a lot in basketball, but the other team hadn't even scored in that time.My husband was pissed and wanted to go home. Half of his day off was gone and he had seen his daughter play less than 2 minutes total for both games. We approached the coach and told her we wanted to know why our daughter wasn't getting much playing time and said we were going to leave with our daughter if she wasn't going to get a chance to play even when her team is ahead and there is less than 5 minutes left in play. The coach told us she had had a conversation with the team before the start of the first game saying some of the players would be doing a lot of cheering and encouraging and not much playing because it was a tournament and they really wanted to bring home the trophy for the girls. She also essentially said our daughter wouldn't be doing really any playing in the next game either, and made another comment about how she shouldn't be discussing this at this time and she needed to go. The next game wasn't for another hour and a half. Our daughter wanted to stay and cheer on her friends so we let her,  but it left a bad taste in our mouths.Yes, our daughter was no star player and we didnt expect her to play a lot, but the kids are in 6th grade. There were a couple other girls who had little playing time and only in the second half of the game. I think they should be allowed to be more than benchwarmers and to do more than cheer for their teammates for an entire game. Am I completely out of touch?

She is aware that she has hoarding tendencies, and has expressed a desire to go to therapy about it, but never followed through.

Moving out is not an option due to my financial situation.I have offered a list of accommodations/modifications my mother could do for cleaning the house and she has not used any of them. I have tried to schedule days where we go through the piles of stuff, but she always has other things pop up or she “doesn’t feel well enough to do that today” due to her disabilities.  I am also disabled and work 45 hours a week.y father is also disabled and does what he can.The house is becoming unsustainable and unsafe to live in, which my mother has acknowledged verbally. There is mold and mice, as well as the tripping hazard from walking past and over the boxes of clothes and the loose clothes on the floor. I worry one of them is going to fall and break something and paramedics would be unable to get to them.No one is willing to assist us with cleaning the house unless we pay them, because it always ends up being covered in stuff again. Our relatives dislike visiting due to the clutter in the house.Am I the asshole for telling my mother to clean the house or I will throw away the things that are too soiled to wash and keep (or the clothes I had when I was 8) because she says she “needs to go through them before they get taken to goodwill because someone could use them or I might give away a family heirloom.”?",

	"body" : "My partner and I have been dating for about 5 years, and living together for 4. They have been absolutely wonderful; they helped me move cross country to live with them and get out of an abusive household, they drive me everywhere (I am unable to drive due to health issues), and are just generally easy to be with. That was until this last November.For some more context: my partner and I are in a Polyamorous relationship, and things have gotten quite complicated between me and one of their partners (TLDR, they were dating me along with my partner, but then broke up with me about a few years ago). We  have been living at their parents place since 2020, and in November three more people have moved in, and all hell as been breaking loose.Since November, the parents and the other family have been forcing us to do a bunch of tasks. A lot of this my partner has skipped helping, instead choosing to go to my ex’s/their current partners. They have done this several times. When I brought it up, they became snippy and one day yelled at me when I asked if we could leave the house  because I was overwhelmed “you wanted me here to do chores, so that’s what I’m doing”.Things have been rocky between us, and we have had more than one conversation about the future of our relationship.To get to the real meat and bones of this post: we had shared a bank account for a few years, and I trusted them with everything, as they wanted to do all the budget stuff. I never asked about the money, or what percentage was going where. That is until a month or so ago.My partner is in a somewhat expensive hobby. Most of it is cheap, but sometimes it can be…a lot. My partner would tell me about these HUGE orders they would make, and I didn’t think anything of it. Until the parents brought up that we were behind in bills.So, I panicked. I took control of my own bank account and money, and have an app on my phone telling me when there’s activity on my account. I’ll be honest, I thought (and still often wonder if) my partner was using my money on their hobby without asking me.My partner owes the parents a huge chunk of money, and has several lines of credit that need to be paid off due to their hobby. We both have jobs and are in college, so money comes and goes quite a bit.I am only able to work 3 days a week due to my health, so I get a significant less amount of money compared to my partner.This year for taxes and school, I am getting an insane amount of money back. There are many things I want, and this money would cover so much of that.My partner was very quick to shoot down my ideas. They -with the saddest of puppy eyes- said “it would be nice if you could help me pay the parents back…you don’t have to…but….”.I was under the impression that we paying the parents when we were supposed to. My partner has been withholding a lot of information from me, no matter the importance of what it is.Would I be the asshole for not helping my partner out with this huge problem that they caused?",

	"body" : "I(32F) volunteered to do the booking for the family camping trip this summer. We planned to go to a popular state park and reservations can be made only as early as 6months out and they book really quickly.I spoke with Dad(64M) and Brother(34M) a few days ago and we agreed the only stipulation was that we needed 3 sites next to each other. I stayed up and at exactly midnight went to reserve the campsites but there was an error. When I refreshed there were only 4 sites available and only two near each other. I messaged everyone and told them what had happened and suggested we aim for a week later and I would try again next week. No one responded to the message but it was late.That morning I spoke with Dad and explained what happened and he agreed there was no problem aiming for the following week. Bro called that afternoon and told me that he could see 2 available sites right next to each other and I explained that the stipulation had been 3 sites next to each other. He suggested that the thirds site could just walk down but I said it would be annoying and not what we agreed on, besides we didn't have any conflicts booking the following week. I told him that I had a headache and was tired from staying up all night and was going to lay down for a nap.Several hours later when I woke I found out that Dad and Bro had booked those two sites. Dad told me I should try to get the far one but unsurprisingly, there are no sites left for that week. I called Dad back and told him there are no sites available so I guess I wont be joining them and that it felt pretty clear to me that it was unimportant if I joined them anyway. He told me that I was overreacting and I'm 'being a B as usual'. I hung up.Why I might be TA:I could just stay with my parents in their RV on this trip, I've done it plenty before and I'm single so its just me and my dogs. However, I have to stay on a super uncomfortable fold out couch that's hard to sleep on, there is no privacy and then its 4 dogs and 3 adults in their RV. I have my own camper where me and my two dogs are perfectly happy and I haven't crashed with my parents in three years except one trip last year when my truck was dead. I didn't ask Dad/Mom when I was speaking with them because its always been implied that I can stay with them. They didn't mention it when we spoke but I have to assume this was their intention?I just don't think that it matters when no one has scheduled vacation days with their employer and no one has anything else currently booked for that last week of July or even in August. It would have been perfectly fine to push back a week and then everyone could have been comfortable. We weren't married to these dates so there wasn't a rush to book. Even if there was a rush to book why didn't they call me? We could have all booked together and then I may have been far away but at least we'd be going together.So, AITA for refusing to go with them?",

At the beginning of their relationship she was in a wheelchair and he lives 3 hours away so he had to come over and stayed in the weekends and i didn't had a problem with it. My sister has gotten better and is now working but it's easier for him to come over than her to go stay with him because of scheduling issues and other stuff. She maybe went 3 times in total to his place but since mid 2022 he's been coming here 97% of  the weekends. When he comes over he stays from Friday till Monday/Tuesday. Sometimes like every 6-8 weeks he stays for 10 days. They also cook apart because they have different diets and he love using the airfryer which for some reason ours use allot of energy.I never had a problem with any of this but it did start to get annoying when i started feeling that i was helping them fund their relationship. We live in a big city so that means a big city apartment price and also it didn't help that energy prices has went up and he never offered to help pay even a little for the extra energy cost. Then i mentioned something and he said that he'll pay 25 euros...our energy cost a month is 245 euros.December came and he was only going to stay here for 1 week but then plans changed  and he stayed here for 3 weeks. He gave my sister 50 euros for the stay and when i brought this up with my parents they didn't like it and told me to speak up. He left Tuesday and came back yesterday which is a Thursday and leave until Monday. I decided to finally speak up and i told my sister that i don't have a problem with him staying here for 3 weeks but that i didn't think that 50 euros was enough while i have to pay way more than that. She immediately got irritated and defensive (typical) and told me that he doesn't live here and doesn't have to pay money like we do. I told her that yeah he doesn't live here but he's using the utilities just like we do.Now look guys...i don't expect him to pay 1/3 of all living costs but tbh i would've been ok if he told me that he'll pay the 50 euros to stay here for the 3 weeks in dec and take my share of the part of the house i had to clean for 1 weekend...literally even with that i would've been fine because he only help my sister with her part that she has to clean. Let's not even talk about how much of a mess he makes in the kitchen.At this moment i don't have a job so i've been living from my savings and it's upsetting to see another person living for free in your house and them not even caring. I think that's the part that hurts me the most because i thought that my sister was a fair person but she's not. I know that if the roles was reversed and i had a boyfriend, i would've let my boyfriend contribute to the household.So AITA for telling my sister that 50 Eu isn't enough for her boyfriend to stay for 3 weeks at our apartment for the holidays",

	"body" : "I (34f) have a son who just turned 5 years old with my ex (46). Our son's going to have a birthday celebration tomorrow as he was sick the day of his actual birthday. For context I have full custody of our child, he lives with me full time and sees his father on Tuesdays for a few hours but recently his father has started helping out more and helping me to care for him when he's sick and can't go to daycare or if I need a babysitter etc so he's been seeing him a lot more recently than just on Tuesdays. However the reason, well the biggest reason anyway, as to why I have custody is because my son's dad is a drug addict and recently spent some time in jail for being in possession of a fire arm. We are not Americans and were we live only the police and hunters are allowed to have fire arms. He got out of jail about 1½yrs ago and hasn't had any relapses since. He is in treatment however, meaning he gets methadone that he gets to pick up once a week and has to take daily.On to the issue. His brother (33) has the same problems as he does regarding drugs, and currently lives with their mother. We have never gotten along and he has been extremely disrespectful in the past, calling me a wh**e and stuff and also blaming me for him and hos  brother's falling out, which is completely false. However they are now on good terms and he has apparently expressed wanting to come to my son's celebration. I said that i don't feel comfortable with that as i don't trust him to stay sober and also due to our history and how he's never even apologised or anything. My ex says that he would never allow for his brother to come if he was on drugs and that he'd notice it right away and send him away if he was and that his brother is doing much better now and is even able to have unsupervised visitation with his own kid once a week now.I said no to him coming but my ex tells me that if his brother isn't welcome then my son's grandmother will not want to come either due to us excluding his uncle and is going to have a separate birthday party for him at her place so that uncle can be there. I dislike having him around my kid at all especially since ex MIL always has defended her grown sons and allowed their drug use or at least looked the other way or been in denial saying they're just tired when clearly under the influence etc. But when he is with his dad I feel I have to accept it.Wibta if I keep refusing to let him come?",

I regularly told her that I appreciated it, and that when I had a job I wouldn't forget and I would try to ease her financial problems. I had a scholarship for tuition fees.But I ended up doing a few years of postgrad where I got a great scholarship. The budget was tight, but I managed to send her ~$4000 over 3 years. This was an insane amount of money that I definitely could use, but it was fine to me.My social life definitely went downward, since I had to decline outings with friends. Whatever money I had left was to survive. This was a sacrifice I was willing to make to help out. I am fine with this.Toward the end of my postgrad, I ended up getting a job in another country. My mom helped me with miscellaneous costs which was around $1900, which I told her I would pay back. In my first month in the new country with my signing bonus, I paid her back $2000. She agreed months before that it would be enough. A month later she said that it wouldn't be enough, citing that I said I would help ease her financial stress, also talking about debt. I did say that I would help her ease financial stress, and sent another $2000. I asked her about her debt to give me a concrete number so I can plan around it. I never agreed to pay her debt but I didn't mind helping out. She declined to give me a number.Since then I sent at least $500 per month for 2 months. That is besides any ad-hoc payments for things that she didn't account for. I didn't keep track of how much I sent and never expected it back.In December I sent ~$500 again. But I told her that I wasn't going to send her too much since I needed to get furniture in my apartment and I really needed to get my life going. So no more ad-hoc payments. I have no savings and would like to get that started. I mentioned it to her and she agreed. After some time she asked me for money when she found out I booked a backpack trip with some friends from university. I told her the money was earmarked months ago (we planned this trip 2 months in advanced) and I couldn't send any more than that.She was furious, saying that I broke my promises to her about helping to ease her financial burdens. After that I told her that it felt like I was only good for money, and that I would also be sending what I can, instead of $500/month. I decided to put myself first to now ease my financial stress.She didn't like that, and she said she couldn't believe that she raised such an ungrateful son. Also, \"You think you paid back all the debt I made for you? I hope that no one tells you the day that I die. I will never forget this and I won't ever forgive you.

Apparently Amy’s reasoning was that Jason had more experience (despite him and I being the same year and being in all the same classes— and me being the only one between us with any executive experience)I went along with it for the first half of my third year but it started to get bad. In 6 months we had 8 planned activities fall through. My policy is that we should plan and advertise events a minimum of 3 months in advance. Jason’s attitude was that it was always either too early or too late to plan anything. I was always the one stuck doing any paperwork and planning and eventually both me and the secretary got tired of it. I’d planned to quiet quit. Our union was supposed to be coordinating a festival for the city and I continued to work on that solo and wait to see if Jason would even call a meeting without me.The secretary on the other hand approached me to talk about just working around them and calling meetings ourselves. She also proposed at the meeting we called that we should open it to the members to re-elect the executive board (the original election consisted of just the 4 execs because it happened before classes started).the secretary and I discussed this on Monday and enacted the plan the Wednesday of the same week. Jason tended to be negligent in general but it seemed somewhat unfair. We only acted so quickly because we had already had to postpone a meeting with the city for a month and the festival is less than 3 months away.I know I’m not blameless in the union’s negligence though. On paper the president and I have the same authority. In practice though I found his consistent absence an obstacle when trying to get things done. A lot could have been solved earlier if I had have put the effort in as VP but I was more than content to watch him fail then deal with the aftermath.When we voted in the new executive board my election to presidency was unanimous but the atmosphere was tense and depressing. Jason usually had a tired defeated look on him but it was more apparent in this meeting. afterwards I felt so awful I went to my bed and cried. I also made some enemies in the union as a few of the members now see me as a jerk and power hungry. They challenge me more at meetings and in class.

We both went ahead and ordered our food as per choices every went very well wine flowed we had a nice evening until the time for ordering the dessert came!!

He basically jumped in surprise to know that the server knew about his allergy and asked how did he knew!!So I stepped in and said that I am the one  who informed him about it.He basically thumped the table with his fist and said \"Who gave me the audacity to share his problems with an outsider who is not entitled to know such personal information?\" I was shocked by his reaction and was dumbfounded and I said sorry for sharing,but without listening he stood up abruptly and walked away leaving me there and went home,I called him several times and even texted him to know where am I wrong!! He neither answered my calls  nor replied to texts and his family is basically on his side and is accusing me of defaming and making him look ill publicly.Am I the AITA ?!",

Since then he's become an important part of my family's life and he's been with me through some difficult times. It was rocky at first as he did not tell his parents about us for 6 years.I moved in with him and his parents (both early 70s) a year ago. We have been saving just the 2 of us for a deposit. His parents have not got a huge amount of money and whilst they've worked since they moved here they havent thought long term. Neither qualify for a state pension, and once the exchange rate was taken into account with the money they brought over it wasnt a lot. My bf's sibilings (early 40s) seem to have left us with the problem of seeing what the best option is.My BF admitted he feels stuck between choosing whats right for us as a couple or supporting his parents. We both want to be married and start a family but feel as we would be having to compromise how we want those things to happen if his parents lived with us. They both are fairly religious and his mother has made comments on the miscarriage we had a couple years ago and the fact i do not go to church.Am I being selfish by saying to him that I dont want to live with his parents and that i would be unhappy?

We're classmates on that one subject that were grouped together then hit off as becoming besties. The issue is that she's a great friend to hang out with. I just don't like her in anything about academic related.She always asked for my answers on activities, but never helped me when I needed it. I told her that if we both work together to solve then only we can share solutions but it seems she doesn't notice that and continues to bombard me with messages asking for my activities. I know I should have cut her off when I saw signs but she's really a great friend. Like we're comfortable sharing our ups and downs.  I guess we were becoming too comfortable with each other in such a short time. This semester, we had two classes together. One of them required an argumentative essay in a week. Iris got   sick during that week. She didn't say what it was but I never pressed on that matter since it's her health and she may be uncomfortable to share it. So she was given an excuse to pass the assignment at a later date, this is according to our university policy.I didn't expect her to  come up to me to want to read the argumentative essay that I've created. I'm not exactly sure what she said but it was something like, \"Can I read your essay? I just want to get the idea since I don't know where I will start.\" I was shocked at the situation and just smiled at her awkwardly. I just told her I'm busy and needed to go somewhere then she says that she will talk to me later.Unlike before, this time she is really persistent. She came to my apartment, called and messaged me constantly, and even contacted my friends and parents.  I don't know what's got into her. Last time it was just messages and sometimes I would ignore it but this time it's too much.I only contacted her again when she passed her assignment. I invited her to the talk at my apartment because I feel like this needed to be in private.During our talk she blamed me for getting a zero and a major offense due to using a.i and high plagiarism because I didn't let her read my work. She started to yell at me and  I was sobbing and hurt at her hurtful words. I'm thankful my roommate was there hearing us and dragged her out.Just yesterday, Iris decided to come to my apartment apologizing and I accepted it.

	"body" : "For a little backstory I 29(F) moved in with my mom 54(F) a year ago to help her with bills and such due to her recent break up with someone she was financially dependent upon. Our agreement was: 75 a week for \"rent\" from me and my, 21(F), sister and throw what I could to a credit card which she had helped me out of a emergency situation with (completely understandable)at that time I was completely healthy. Now the past few months I've been going through some very unexpected health issues; I found out I have some sort of autoimmune disease through blood tests and have been thrown for a loop with everything. My physical and mental health have been rapidly declining and in turn has cost ALOT of money between having to quit a toxic job (so Im down to one full time job), going to the er (which makes me miss days of work and are unpaid), and paying for medication because I currently can't afford health insurance and am waiting on state assistance, buying gluten-free food for myself just incase part of my issues is celiacs disease and paying for specialists visits such as rheumatology and neurology. This is all on top of my normal monthly bills and I am far from wealthy I make about 500 a week after taxes; I have a 500 dollar car payment, 150 dollars to insurance and I have about 65 to 70 out in subscriptions the whole house uses and about 100 out in natural medication because I'm trying to stay away from pills and gas is like 80 a week if I'm lucky. At the end of the week I'm lucky if I have 20 dollars left over for myself alot of the  time I'm in the negatives. Now this past month I haven't been able to pay every single week I've missed twice on \"rent\" due to me missing work because of the er visits. My mom and I got in a bit of a spat because I was talking about going to a better paying job so I can afford my expenses. If I get this job I'll be making about 27 an hr a huge difference from what I am making now. As soon as I mentioned this my mom wanted to double my rent! I was floored! I told her absolutely not, the whole reason I wanted to change jobs (because I absolutely love my current job and would not leave it unless I absolutely had to) is so I can keep up on current rent and expenses and have a bit left over for myself, I absolutely refuse to give her ALL my extra money and have nothing left for myself I want to be able to save in case of emergency expenses or, idk, I wanna buy my own house. My mom has been down my neck for money lately but I'm tapped I have nothing left to give. My sis only works a part time min wage job and is also attending online collage I told mom she needs to ask her to get a full time job if she wants more money she sleeps till noon most days and works less than 32 hrs a week sometimes as little as 18 hrs. Mom said she dosent want to \"push her\" especially while shes in collage. I am at wits end I came there to help that is it, not be bled dry.",

	"body" : "My roommate Jake recently asked me to beta read his book for him. I was pretty excited about it because I knew it was something he'd been working on for a while. Honestly, it wasn't bad. The world building was interesting, the character arcs and development were great, and it is a nice long fantasy book set in a complex world. There were still some issues, a lot of it grammar and spelling, but this was still his rough draft, so I expected that.Aside from some minor things such as a few inconsistencies and out-of-place world building, the biggest issue by far was the humor. Jake is terrible at trying to be funny. He has his moments, but especially in his writing, it comes out forced and cringy.The biggest issue for me was one of his characters would often talk about wanting to masturbate or talk about how he recently masturbated. It was often out of the blue, during serious moments, and even the few times where it did kind of make sense, such as at a party where the character was drunk, I thought it was disgusting and unneeded.I told him the positives first, and he agreed with the spelling and grammar issues. However, when it come to the humor, he was deeply offended. I don't think I was too harsh, but maybe I was. I said something along the lines of, \"I don't really understand the humor. To me, characters saying they need to masturbate and talking about how much they want to do it isn't funny.\"He got really defensive and said I was flaming him and essentially being a bully. I said that he asked for critical feedback, and he retorted by saying that he meant spelling and grammar issues as the book was his vision and I was just being mean and I shouldn't say anything negative. I almost laughed at that, but I contained myself.I again said the book was good, just that the humor didn't work for me and he didn't like that either. He said he got the idea from Rick and Morty because apparently Morty talks about having to masturbate a lot. I've never watched Rick and Morty so I don't know if it's true or not.Anyway, what do you all think? AITA?",

The other day I hung out with a couple of friends we went out to grab some food before heading to a bar.We went to this sandwich place and my friend ordered himself a very large sandwich and a large soda. He ate about 85% of the sandwich but there was still at least 3-4 bites left on it. He tossed the rest of it away. To be fair he asked us is any of us wanted it. But we declined. I said no because the idea of eating someone else’s food grossed me out. He also got the large drink which was a dollar more but he could have opted for the smaller one and just gotten free refills. But he just didn’t want to get up.Anyways we left the sandwich shop and we began to walk and he reached into his pocket and grabbed his change, the coins and literally tossed them on the sidewalk. I was taken aback. I asked him why he did that and he said he doesn’t like change because it weighs his pants down and he hates carrying coins. I told him he can’t do that and he said of course he can he just did and always does.While at the bar I couldn’t let it go and told him he was insane. That if he tossed out $.50 cents everyday he was wasting well over a hundred dollars a year. He said he didn’t care and said if I am that desperate for money I can go pick it up. The rest of the night was awkward. He kept insisting on buying me beers even though I have money. He did it to rub it in my face. At the end of the night I flat out told him he was irresponsible and stupid and his arrogance was gross considering how many people struggle just to stay afloat.I told my girlfriend and she said I was harsh and confrontational for no reason. She said that the money can go to homeless people of whoever happened to find it so he’s not actually throwing it away.Idk Reddit was I the asshole?",

I'd thought to myself that I wasn't looking for a commute buddy or really any new friends, but talking to her wasn't so bad as she was pretty easy to talk to.She would talk a lot about herself, explaining her relationship dynamics with her boyfriend, her family; dog troubles, work life and how hard she has it. To me, I never got the impression that she wanted my help specifically, but only to have someone to vent to from time to time. Which I was fine with.As time passed, she would explain in more detail about her life. She told me about how abusive her boyfriend is, how manipulative her job is, how toxic her family was; the fact that she's barely scraping by, how she struggles to find a place to live due to bad credit and not having a support system... the list goes on. The bad would outweigh the good by a mile each time. I would try my best to give her advice, and help her think through situations and come up with solutions. This was every time I saw her.All of her woes made my heart break for her, time and time again. Whenever we would see each other, she would update me on the next unlucky thing that would happen to her. And like clockwork, I would give advice. Eventually her texting grew to be a daily thing. This was getting too much for me- sometimes it was 2-3 times a day, even when I didn't respond. And when I did, she would come back with novels explaining her woes to which I would feel obligated to give advice for.She started calling me her best friend and that I was something special to her. This felt like she was desperately clinging to anyone that would give her attention, even if it were just from time to time. We didn't hang out outside of the commute (which was about 30 minutes) And we went out to ONE lunch in person.Around when her texts got frequent, my family and I were going through a rough time with a dying loved one and my job was becoming more demanding. Her daily texts were causing anxiety that I didn't need.After mulling it over with my partner and debating with myself, I sent her the text asking to stop texting me daily, and explaining my feelings towards our relationship. After that, she didn't respond. In fact, I found out that she blocked me on everything.So now I feel shitty for asking at all, and I've lost her as a friend completely.AITA for asking my clingy friend directly to stop texting me so much, and my feelings on how I cannot be her BEST friend?

She proceeded to tell him how we were loud for DAYS and her kids were sleep deprived and couldnt go to school because of us and this made me SO MAD because WHY didnt she tell me since day 1?! And why couldnt she wait to tell ME?She didnt say anything until last night and turned it into such a big deal when it really wasnt and the problem was already solved when she told me the first time to be quiet, since we did keep very quiet afterwards. -(or so i thought).Anyways when I got home I got a lot of negativity from my dad, saying how i cant respect other people, or dont understand them, or how i should act accordingly. But how should I know when the neighbours wont say anything?So since I am obviously the asshole according to my dad and my neighbours, am I actually the asshole?UPDATE: Talked with my neighbours, turned out they never had a problem with me and my friends talking on the balcony (even if we were a little louder) because they always had their AC, this month their AC broke for about a week now so they left their windows open.They apologized for being rude and we came to the conclusion next time i have friends over I will let them know before hand, and if we are too loud (or they decide not to open their AC when my friends are over) they should say something before it gets out of hand.",

This is around the time when Elsie started complaining about random harmless things, some of which I hadnt even done.It all started with her saying that I needed to stop closing her door when she had left it open, that it threw her off whenever she came home to the door being closed. I have never done that. I would have no reason to, her door is the last one in that hallway and it's not like it being open gets in the way of anything. I had noticed the door being closed more often, but thought nothing of it. I told her as such but she just rolled her eyes and told me to just stop doing it.The next thing she complained about was me being noisy which, okay, fair, but I've tried to be quieter around the apartment (idk, I took my shoes off to make my steps quieter and have stopped listening to stuff without headphones) and she's still complaining about it. I asked her what else she wanted me to do and she was all \"stop throwing stuff when you're in the kitchen, do it gently\" which.... ?? Dunno what she's talking about there tbh.She's also said that I need to stop leaving wet footprints in the hallway which okay!! I get how that's annoying and have been more careful about it, but she's acting like it hasn't stopped.Her latest wild accusation, and what prompted this post, is that apparently I have taken to stealing her salt.

It's not my fault if she forgot she closed her door or if she misplaced her salt somehow.IDK I feel like I haven't done anything wrong here but she's clearly very pissed that I said she was crazy mid argument.

Also on mobile so please ignore grammatical errors.Title sounds worse than it is but my BF gifted me a stuffed whale on one of our first few dates 4 years ago, I held onto it for years until we had a massive fight almost a year ago and broke up for around 8 months.The blowout was really bad and I thought we were done for good as we hadn’t spoken to each other for 6 1/5 months. About a month and a half into the split I decided I needed to get rid of everything he gave me or that reminded me of him which included loads of pictures (however he has copies of most of not all of them), some clothes (hoodies and t-shirts mostly) and heartbreakingly my stuffed whale. I didn’t want to just throw it out so I took it to a local kids group home.I had a really bad health scare a few months ago and my mom reached out to him. He visited me in the hospital and reconciled and got back together and are currently in couples therapy.A week ago he asked where she was and when I explained I donated her he got really upset. She meant a lot to both of us, and it really hurt me to give her up. But he’s been a bit distant and cold ever since. And I can’t help feeling like I really messed up our second chance and should have just hid her away in my closet.So AITA?TLDR: I donated my stuffed whale after my BF and I broke up, now that we’re back together I feel terrible.",

	"body" : "I am a female freshman in college in a dorm with another girl. For anonymity, let's call her Sarah. Sarah and I began talking on Instagram about nine months before college, snapping and face timing often - we became good friends. She made many promises about going out, doing stuff together, and having each other's backs. When we got to college, things started to take a turn. We went out together a total of 3 times before I decided she was a massive red flag. At each party we went to, she ditched me for a boy, and I was stuck walking home by myself, drunk and in a town I was still unfamiliar with. I often tried to do more casual things with her, like offering to work out, go for coffee, or study. The very few times we did those things, it was often awkward, her passive-aggressive remarks and my general feeling of discomfort around her. She started to make excuses and hang out with her other friends. I was always lovely, initiating conversations with her friends when they came over, but she was always putting on a show in front of them, being rude or ignoring me. Then, when the door shut, she was a fake version of excellent, pretending like she wanted to be close. Flash forward, I established friends outside of my disappointments with my roommate. Sarah and I only really talked in the room and had our friends. But, when I had my birthday at college, I still invited her to my birthday as it was the correct thing to do. A couple of weeks later, I had to find out from a mutual girlfriend, whom I had introduced to Sarah, that Sarah was having a big birthday dinner and invited all her girlfriends, including three girls I introduced her to - but not me. I knew I could either blow this up or remain mature. I stayed out of the dorm and at my boyfriend's place the night of the party. When I returned (the girls all went to the frats after her party), there were about 30 solo cups all over the floor (right near my space) and a nauseating stench of alcohol in the dorm. I cleaned it all up and decided not to confront her but distance myself because her not inviting me told me where we stood.Over winter break, she only snapped at me and never texted, and I was the one who had to say \"Merry Christmas\" and \"Happy New Year!\" Since we've returned from break, we've probably spoken about ten words to each other - all surface-level conversations. I want to move out so bad; being in the room with her makes me anxious, and I have much more positive girlfriends I would rather live with. I don't wanna deal with her anymore.",

A previous medicine I have used before is Cipro (antibiotic). I went to my familys house this past weekend and before leaving, my mom asked me to bring my old prescription of Cipro since she wants to use it for a tooth problem (I don't quite know what the problem is). I originally said no problem.My fiancee saw that I was packing it and was confused as to why I would bring my mom medicine that she wasn't prescribed (especially for a tooth, which my fiancee has said is not commonly fixed with cipro, but other medications). She said it's a bad idea since cipro may alter her body in an unexpected way (build immunity, etc.) and her doctor should be the one to prescribe it. Additionally, she feels it is risky for me to give medicine with my name on it to another person.So I didn't and told my mom that I left them at home accidentally. She was fine with it at the time.I am back at my own home now. An hour ago, she texted me asking if I would mail her the medicine now that I'm home. She said in the same message that her dentist will prescribe her cipro but she said \"don't worry, my son will mail me some.\"I said that I don't feel comfortable mailing it , get it from the dentist since he already prescribed it...and she responded back with this long message yelling at me so not bringing it in the first place. \"You should bring the pills without letting *fiancee* know. This is the racquet doctors pull to keep seeing patients for money. It's a business.\"Now she's saying to \"keep your meds, I'll get my own.\" I feel guilty because she has given me anti-nausea medicine before that was apparently a prescription and that seems hypocritical on my part.I'm in a really tough situation and I feel bad for not helping my mom, but if she was able to get it, I don't know why I'm in the middle. My fiancee also doesn't love the idea of doing this type of thing. AITA?Edit: This isn't the first time this has happened. In the past, I told her it was unethical and possibly dangerous. She didn't agree with that and was angry. I decided to lie this time to try to make it easier while I was visiting, but that obviously didn't go well. I do feel guilty for lying, but the anxiety of being there without the pills on purpose freaked me out.",

I have only met Ted and Amy a few times in a group settings but we haven’t talked much. 2 nights ago they come over to our house and we are all talking and Ted mentions his new job at WingStop and we all jokingly ask if we can get free food. He mentions that with other restaurants they will sometimes trade food.I work at a well known steakhouse down the street.Last night I get off work around 11. At that point there is only about 3 places open and I decide to stop by WingStop to grab food for me and my roommate. The fact that her brother worked there was an afterthought. When I walk in I see him in the back cooking so I nod to him and say hey, he nods back then goes to the back of the restaurant where I can’t see him.I order my food, wait, and then leave. This morning I wake up to a text from his girlfriend Amy. She says that me showing up to his place of work unannounced made him uncomfortable and was disrespectful.She says that she wants to set a boundary since they don’t have opposite sex friends in their relationship.I share this with my roommate and she tells me that Amy asked for my number the night before under the pretense that she wanted to send me something real quick and that it was good to have in case something were to happen and they needed to get ahold of us.I respond to Amy saying that I apologize for making him uncomfortable.I explain that there is not much open at that hour and in my mind if I didn’t say hi that would be disrespectful.She then responds repeating how it was weird that I showed up and that it would’ve been ok if I came with Jill since we are friends and that is his sister.I said it was good to have boundaries but that I won’t be announcing when I plan to go somewhere to someone I barely know.She had brought up the free food thing so I explain that we had been joking and that I never asked for anything from him, that I simply said hi so that hopefully we could all be on a good standing bc I assume they would be coming over more in the future-which is now not happening.I stated that next time I wouldn’t say hi and that I will go there again at some point and this is my only warning.She says it’s ok to go to WingStop and that she just wanted to set a boundary, I ask her what her boundary is exactly since nothing else happened.She says that I shouldn’t expect free food and that was her only point.Meanwhile my roommate texts her saying she doesn’t appreciate being lied to in order to get my number.She responds saying she meant no hate but that we wouldn’t understand since they are in a “traditional relationship” and that we have different views.My issue is if it was about the free food then why did she mention their traditional relationship and how they can’t have opposite friendships.This isn’t the first problem my roommate and her family have had with her.",

Anna also was very insecure (overthinker) in the start of her relationship (let's call him Adam), and often vented to me about issues. I always offered her advice and my thoughts, even beginning to repeat the same advice that I'd given multiple times. I never have had or had anything against Adam. This developed into a pattern, Anna would only talk to Adam, then a fight or argument would happen, then Anna would come back only to vent and ask for advice or a listening ear, then ignore said advice and go back to Adam. We also argued a lot in the beginning, I was and am admittedly a rather stubborn person, but when she told me I needed to be better at communicating things rather than shutting down all the time, I agreed and did so, among other things.I came home from an after-school activity, and on the drive home, my mom had informed me my sister had come home crying and just had gone into our room and not come out. I was worried and I walked into our room and was about to turn on the lights when Anna lifted the blanket and mumbled something along the lines of \"I have a headache, keep the lights off.\" I asked her what Anna meant but she didn't respond. I left the lights off, and left the room for a while. I then came back and turned on the lights because I had some work to do and it was very dark in the room.

She said that \"a headache was basically the same thing.\" and I disagreed, and said \"that doesn't really tell me anything on you being sick at all.\"Anna said that \"a sick person doesn't have the energy to give full explanations of status,\" and I said \"All I was asking for you to communicate was that you were sick instead of just 'I have a headache', no explanation needed.\"Anna disagreed and said \"You're the one in the wrong here, you just need to know that.\" That made me upset and I said \"You can't say communication is key and then not communicate.\" Anna then just said \"I'm not arguing with you anymore.\" I was upset and said I wasn't Adam and to stop treating me like him, hurtful, I know.

I (30F) recently got married to my wonderful husband Larry (33M), and our wedding went perfectly except for one thing.  Larry has two older siblings: Candace (38F) and Orlando (40M), and he's very close to them.  He also has several cousins, most of whom he likes.  He has a cousin, Susan (38F), who's married to Gabriel (39M).  Larry thinks that Susan has undiagnosed autism due to her difficulties in social situations and inability to maintain eye contact.  Candace and Orlando agree with this assessment.  Apparently she was never diagnosed because her younger brother Brad, 35M, had high-maintenance ADHD that required a lot of their parents' attention when they were younger, so Susan didn't get as much attention.  I'd met Susan once at a large family function before our wedding and she was very nice, but I didn't get a chance to know her better because there were so many people.  Brad is super nice as well, and I've gotten to know him better because he and his wife live closer to us.  Brad also thinks that Susan might have autism.Anyway, when Larry and I were doing seat arrangements for our wedding, we ended up with several tables that only had two spots available, so we had to split up larger parties.  We put Brad and his wife at a table with other cousins their age, as Larry thought Brad would get along with everyone better.  We put Susan and Gabriel at a table with older relatives, as Larry thought Susan would be more comfortable there.Throughout the reception, Brad and his wife had a great time socializing, whereas Susan didn't.  Every time she'd try to go socialize with them, the other cousins would be polite but would talk around her about things that didn't include her, so she felt left out.  Susan and Gabriel eventually just left the reception halfway through the evening, but no one noticed her absence for several hours.  It wasn't until we were doing final photos at the end of the evening that someone thought to look for Susan, couldn't find her, and then texted her to ask her where she'd gone.  She simply said that she and Gabriel had left earlier. Everyone got upset that she didn't tell anyone she'd left, and Larry was mad that she ruined our final photos by disappearing.Here's where I might be TA: I texted Susan that it was no wonder everyone thought she had autism when she acted like this.  She responded by blocking everyone's phone numbers and has been off the grid since then.  Now Brad is saying that I'm TA for 'outing' our opinions of her when we could've just kept it quiet, but I was upset that Susan had caused such a fuss at my wedding.  AITA?",

	"body" : "Can someone tell me if me and my friends are the actual assholes here?!so my friend(A) is organizing a party for her 17th birthday and what was supposed to be a fun night has now ended in a potential friend group-ending disagreement.The first I heard about the party was when she told me about a week and a half before her actual birthday. Where I come from this is quite impolite, considering the fact that there is little time between the supposed (half) invite and the party itself. I was happy to be granted an invitation and looked forward to the actual party. Later though, i heard from my friends that we weren’t invited to the ACTUAL party, even thought she always gets invited to everything?! Apparently she was going to go to dinner with some other girls and we were all invited as a sort of after-party. From what I gathered we would be expected to arrive after they finished their meal, and go out clubbing. There are a few problems with this: (1) we are all underage and are not allowed to drink, therefore a lot of my and her (A) friends won’t be allowed to go. This would result in the fact that her party would make it impossible for ALL of her friends to attend, even though if she herself was invited to a party it was always a fun time for every one and a very inclusive night. (2) it looked like we would have to pay for  the drinks and food, a ticket to get in the club and a present for her. This would come out to a total of 30 bucks. Now this might not seem like a lot to every one, so just to you all give you an idea of how broke we all are: people send around payment request for things as little as an 80 cent bottle of water. No one has money.Because of these reasons i messaged her(A) asking if we were expected to pay for all of these expenses or if her family would cover some of it. Now mind you this girl is pretty rich: she has designer bags, goes on vacations to New York etc. and her family sometimes even hires private chefs. Her reply was: “No i’m not paying for anything. You could have known about the expenses from the beginning it’s not my problem.” And when asked for a more specific program for the actual night itself she told us: “I don’t know any specifics we’ll see what happens and what time we go out.” Again, mind you, we are all underage and have strict parents who won’t let us go out without knowing specific data about locations, time etc.Me and my two close friends started asking more questions, and complaining to her about the expected costs and the fact that she had no details about anything. We were also still hurt about the fact that we weren’t even invited to the actual party itself, and all she said (A) was that WE were the problem, and that if we continued she would blow off the whole party.Now my question is: are we in the wrong here? Are we being selfish and pushy? Because if it were up to her (A) we would be scolded by the whole crowed at that party.",

Me and Lucy are close, known each other since early high school, and occasionally I’ll get guys asking me for her number or if she’s seeing anyone (don’t give your friends numbers to people). I don’t really mind it but I usually end up saying “oh I don’t know, I’ll ask her” or something like that.An acquaintance of mine, “Adam” (M20 I think) recently asked me about Lucy. I don’t really know Adam, other than from class, but he’s super introverted and kind of a stoner. No judgement there, trust me, he’s just not a great match. I told Adam that Lucy wasn’t really looking (true), but he told me he had a plan to ask her out and he asked me for her schedule so he could execute said plan. I told him no and that it wasn’t a good idea for him to go after her like that. He freaked out a little and told me I was being selfish and that he was a great guy and it was unfair of me to keep him from her. He told me to nudge Lucy in the right direction and to just give him a chance. I told him sure so he’d get off my back.Of course it’s Lucy’s decision, i’m not her keeper like Adam seems to think, but she deserves to know the full story, and I told her. She’s glad I didn’t give him anything and she was a little creeped out and ended up blocking his instagram.I don’t really think i’m the AH but guess I just want to give him the benefit of the doubt and i’m feeling a little guilty for maybe making unfair presumptions even though Lucy made her decision. AITA?UPDATE: So yeah I wasn’t expecting anything else to happen but I opened my instagram when I got home today and saw a bunch of angry dms from Adam. He noticed she blocked him (kinda strange, I guess he was checking her account) and called me all sorts of names and accused me of some stuff.——Info: I’m gay, I have a girlfriend of 2 years that I love very much, Lucy is straight, we’re just friends and absolutely nothing has occurred between us. She’s like a sibling to me. My girlfriend is also friends with Lucy now and there are no problems there.——Adam’s accusing me of keeping Lucy for myself and I’m just a little freaked out. I’m open with my sexuality and my school is very progressive, I guess just a little worried of Adam saying/doing something. Yuck. Anyway, he’s blocked now and I’m absolutely sure I made the right decisions. Also i got a message on here asking if my friend would be interested in someone. It never stops lmao. Thanks for reading",

It was for an incident regarding me being groomed by an online friend.However, I would have actually told her anything because of the trust we built, but she was gone way too soon.I feel like I should have asked her to stay so I could speak to her about what had gone on at home. Whenever I try to get another therapist now, they always tell me that I am completely fine and shouldn't need one.My stepdad has been harming me for a while now, and I don't know why. I tried to stay back and allow it to happen in private so I wouldn't worry anyone I cared about.I thought that this would be the best thing to do as it didn't involve anyone that could ruin my family's lives or anything surrounding it.This is where it went on for a while where my stepdad would do things to me in different ways, and I wouldn't be able to tell anyone, so I hid it from everyone.I have never been known as a selfish person as I would always put everyone else in front of myself, no matter the circumstances.However, at one point it did get too much and I had to tell a friend. This friend ended up essentially being my \"new therapist\" whom I told everything.And at one point, he had said to me \"this has to stop, you need to tell someone\".I hadn't listened to this advice no matter how much he told me, and it had gone on for 4 months before I did anything.We went to tell someone what was happening, and thought that it would simply get sorted, with me getting out of the house, but it has ended up being more complicated than we imagined.We had to report this to the police, so they came around the same night, removing my stepdad from the family home.I thought this would give me a safe haven to talk and be myself, yet I had been pushed around even more, and no one at home believes me.I have told the police that if it is going to affect my family so much, to remove me rather than my stepdad from the house.The police have explained that they cannot do that as of yet, but I feel I have torn my family apart.My family can't even look at me after this, yet I thought was doing the right thing.

	"body" : "I (37f) asked my husband (40m) to cook food that I like and have been buying ingredients more aligned to what I want to eat. He says IATA because I complained. Backstory is we have a baby 8mo. The last year and a half he’s been doing all the cooking because I was pregnant and working a lot, recovering from a hard birth and struggling with breastfeeding the baby. The issue is not that he is upset about doing all the cooking. He’s upset that I complained and bought different food. For example, I asked him not to make anymore plain pasta and peppers with sausage because we’ve eaten it so many times times, and I bought food to make quiche because that’s something I like and miss cooking. I might be TA because this sounds ungrateful, but I just miss cooking myself and making foods that I like. I simply don’t have time because I do more baby care. I had him look this over so it isn’t biased. So, AITA?EDIT: Just to clarify, his dad is a very involved father and overall amazing husband. We’ve tried to switch off and have me do cooking, but our baby wants to breastfeed almost constantly in the evening because he “tanks up” and sleeps 9pm-6am (yes, we have an amazing baby). I cannot just “pump” as some have suggested because I would need to pump every time he eats to keep up my milk supply. I am a “just enougher”. We both do not want me to give up breastfeeding just to cook as it’s better for the baby.Another edit: My husband is a better cook than I am. He just likes different food and we’ve had a lot of repeats due to staying in a budget (as you all know food is ). I did try to buy food I like and send him recipes and he likes to cook the food he likes to cook. Also, some of you really don’t seem to understand the commitment and time that breastfeeding a baby takes. It’s a lot of time! We both work full time, and feeding the baby takes me 3.5+ hours on weekends and 2+ on days he is at daycare for most of the day. That doesn’t include the time I pump right before bed when his dad is putting him to bed. Breastfeeding and pumping is a full time job.Hopefully last edit: My husband wants everyone to know that his repertoire has been limited by little freezer space (I made a breast milk stash just in case), food is super expensive/he’s been trying to stay in budget, and he’s making sure I get the right nutrients for the baby. He also thinks I could have asked more nicely and the way I said it sounded like criticism. I own that. Maybe I am slightly TA.More: Wow. I’m sad to see so much judgement for our feeding choices, which was not an issue here at all. Neither of us feel it’s worth me cooking to do less for our baby. And yes, I am a former low supplier and exclusive pumper who worked my ass off to put milk aside in the freezer (waking up at 3 am) just in case my supply drops again and currently I can pump just enough while at work, but have been advised by lactation consultants that if I supplement with my stash my supply will drop again and I should keep it for emergencies until he’s closer to a year. All this has nothing to do with what my husband is cooking. For those of you saying just pump and bottle feed, I do not respond to a pump like a baby and that would actually take more time than breastfeeding. Not everyone can just pump for 20 mins and get a lot. My breastfeeding journey has been very very challenging but we’re committed to it and in no way think it would be worth changing so I can cook different food. That’s just not worth it.So: People still insisting we could trade off. That’s exactly what we tried to do with the quiche. I bought the stuff for quiche, I attempted to make the quiche while he watched the baby. Baby is starving in the evening and was screaming for me. Husband had to take over making the quiche and was not happy because it’s not something he usually makes and feels comfortable making, despite being a good and experienced cook. So we’ve accepted that he has to do the cooking.",

However, I’m not that kind of person to be selfish and I let my mates use it when they want. That is until it gets too much, sure I’m sharing it but I do have rules over it. I am as much as a nicotine addict as them so it’s only fair if I have rules over my own vape.My mate does not buy vapes of their own often, instead they use other peoples, that is okay, however, they take a lot of puffs.

My friend, however, is not happy with my decision and begged for it back, I told them no yet they still asked so I folded and told them only to have a bit.

My friend goes to leave my house after I say goodbye until they ask for one more puff before they leave, I refuse but then feel bad so I give it to them (one puff couldn’t hurt right?). Annoyingly they do not take one puff and continues to take around 10 long pulls without even taking a breath in between as if it was about to run away, they just kept going completely oblivious to the fact I said to only take one. I stop them and take MY OWN vape back as they ask for one more, I say no sternly checking the juice inside to see none left at all, the coil had burnt due to them taking long puffs and draining the juice.

In his workplace, he has a beautiful office with abundant light, an amazing view, in a stunning building. Yet, he typically only goes there when he uses the gym next door. He initially said he would invest in making his office nicer and bought new furniture but has now changed his mind.Instead, he wants to live separately and rent a different, very nice (and very expensive) place near our family home, where he can live the life he prefers. He told me he wants to 'wake up and work with his pajamas on the couch.' In our home, this is difficult, not least because of our toddler, who will interrupt any work with a computer on the couch. Our home is also not very big, with a living room and kitchen connected on the first floor, so mine and our child‘s day is typically spent there. We do have a very small office/guest room, but it's not particularly nice or well-lit, and I'm sure my husband would not be happy to work exclusively in it, even though he raised it as an option. Buying a bigger place is currently not in the cards for many reasons.I understand that my husband doesn't want to spend his days in the office because it's not as comfortable, requires a commute, and he typically doesn't work all day but only a few hours, often with large breaks. Additionally, many of his colleagues also work from home. However, having someone in the house who spends a lot of his days in a very erratic way, reading news or texting with friends, and wanting to talk and discuss in between has been challenging for me and significantly disrupts any routines and schedules I want to have for our child.AITA for wanting my husband to go to work like most people do and spend his workdays outside of the family home?",

Me and Jane don’t talk anymore and haven’t for roughly 1.5 years now. My other friend let’s call her Sally is getting married in two months I recently went out with Sally and another friend Fran where I was told that Jane’s new boyfriend let’s call him Pat who’s a police officer and who IVE NEVER MET has been saying if I mention my boyfriend at the wedding he’s ‘going to say something’. I spoke with Sally about this and explained it’s her wedding, I would’ve happily gone and ignored Jane and Pat and made sure I didn’t do anything to ruin the day but if Pat does say something I probably will get angry and argue with him. Sally said she would speak to Jane when she next saw her.Here’s where I might be the AH, I didn’t think it was good enough to wait until Sally possibly saw Jane before the wedding considering they don’t meet that often and she wouldn’t discuss this over message so I messaged Jane myself. I didn’t put anything rude just asked why her boyfriend is saying that and why she doesn’t find that weird considering he’s never even met me? I could walk past him in the street and not know who he was.Sally and Fran were pissed that I messaged but I feel like I’ve got the right seen as though no one else seems to be saying anything to this man? Because of their reaction I don’t even feel I want to go to the wedding and really I feel like something should’ve been said to Pat already. So AITAH?",

	"body" : "I have been travelling Australia & have made some friends along the way. I'm from the UK. 2 of them got a job in picking fruit & decided to move to a small town. I also got this job & decided to go with them. On the way, we met with one of the girls' friends from home & she decided to also join us & was the last to get the job. As there was 4 of us, there was no longer room in the car so I had to fly & I got there 5 days earlier.When I got there, my boss said that the fruit season hadn't started & so put me onto other work in the meantime, like working in a club & petrol station. I was ok with this as I believed it to be a temporary situation. The latter job is the worst I have ever had, with a micromanaging manger who has made rather inappropriate advances towards me which have left me feeling very uncomfortable, meaning that I really don't want to work there & this isn't just a normal petrol station job.When the girls arrived the season still hadn't started so I was still working the odd jobs & they were going to be started there as well. One Friday, however, my manager started them on some other fruit and then they were started that Monday on the main fruit we had come to pick. I already had to do the work in the club as I had made that commitment as I had been rostered, so I couldn't join them, & I assumed that I would be started with them on the Monday.On the weekend, another guy  who applied and arrived after me got put onto the farm work, despite my insistence to the manager that I wanted to work on the farm.Monday rolls around & I haven't been put on that farm work, instead doing very few and short shifts at the petrol station & barely clocking 20hrs a week total between that & the club. Now it's been almost 2 weeks & the girls have been working non stop (yes 7 days a week) & despite begging, I have not been put onto work the farm because my manager says I don't need my farm days to renew my visa as I'm from the UK. They've been told that they'll have 3 more weeks of picking ahead of them.Now AITA for being upset with them for not sharing their shifts with me? We got into an argument and my case for this was that we all left the big city in order to go up together & work on the farm, & now that we've come up here and they've got work, they no longer care about that camaraderie as they've got it good. I applied and got the job before one of the girls and the guy who moved in that weekend & yet I still didn't get work which to me is incredibly unfair. I also came the earliest out of everyone and showed initiative for taking any shift, anywhere that I could and feel punished for it.These girls are getting 7 days a week, 8 hour shifts while I'm struggling to cross the 20hr barrier. To me it would seem fair to rotate who takes a day off, that way 3 of us get 5 days a week and one 6 days and we'd all have enough to live on. I no longer want to remain friends as I feel really rejected and not cared about in this situation.",

It seemed like she was flirting back and she was also interested in me. She even called me her girlfriend at one point, so I thought everything was going well. Until she started to ghost me for days. Long story short, she was always giving an excuse. I confessed to her. She rejected me and I thought we were okay (we agreed to be friends because she told me that she doesn't want to cut the relationship between us). That is until I caught her lying. Being disappointed, I tried to get a clear answer from her as to why. Here is the thing though: we met in person before this incident. She was hugging me and I felt like it was a nice time (this was after I confessed to her). Apparently it was not, because she told me that our relationship felt weird and it all started months before I confessed to her. She said that she doesn't want to be friends with me anymore. She also told me that she tried to ignore me on purpose so I won't bother with her. What did she think though? We were friends, did she really think I'll just ignore her and never communicate with her ever again? I first thought that it must have been because I was too pushy, but apparently she didn't even realize that I was genuinely trying to flirt with her. Regardless, I spent a lot of time and money on our relationship, because I do a lot for people who I feel close to (I don't mind this part actually). She hasn't texted me ever since I wished her a happy birthday, which was 16 days ago. She has a belonging at my place, however. I don't want to text her because I still feel like I was being used and lied to.That being said, I still feel guilty about it because this thing doesn't belong to me and she paid for it.

I and that member are pretty close friends - way closer than she and the third member are. But she cancels more than 2/3 of the rehearsals (and we asked her before deciding on a time), she doesn't do what she says she will, etc.This kinda culminated earlier this week. About half a year ago we decided on a new song to play. There exists no tabs for it, but she really wanted to play it and offered to make one. I asked (for the 100th time) if she had done it and got a no for an answer. I then suggested we'd play another song while she did it, and then it somehow was my fault because I hadn't made a tab.The idea of creating a new band, without her has been on my mind for a while, because I actually want to play, learn a decent size repertoire and maybe try to get a gig at a cafe or something. At this point we haven't had a rehearsal since November (we're supposed to have them weekly) and she has cancelled almost all of them.Now the thing is that I do value our friendship a lot, and wouldn't wanna f**k that up. The second issue is that most of my friends (at least the ones who would be interested in being in a band) are mutual.I've tried asking if she's not interested (not straight out, but hinting that there would be no hard feelings if she wanted to quit) but I'm getting sick of her not showing up and not keeping her promises.So reddit, wibta if I pulled the plug on this project, and made a new band with the drummer and somone else?",

Pam told me to put it in the cupholder but I told her no because I knew it would spill over. I know that Pam told me to put it down out of consideration. I was a little annoyed because she kept insisting I put it down, so I replied no and told her why gravity would make the drink spill in an annoyed voice.On the road, Pam breaks really hard and when I ask her why, she tells me that she wants the drink to spill and that I'm a butthole to her. She tells me how ungrateful I am (maybe for not getting her a sample drink and refusing to put the drink down?) and tells me that she regrets giving birth to me and Bob. Luckily, Bob wasn't in the car to hear that.Pam tells me that she will never help me again and to not ask her for anything. This has happened many times over the past. Some examples are if I told Pam I didn't want to do something at the moment and she would get angry, I respond to Pam saying that I did this and that already but she tells me I'm disrespectful for talking back, or I ask Pam for a small favor not realizing she was in the middle of something.I know that I often get agitated and annoyed so my responses could sound rude/with attitude, and sometimes when I respond with \"No\" it is unreasonable. Pam often has mood swings so it also makes me wonder if I am an awful person to Pam or it's because Pam is sensitive to what people say to her.At this point though I think I'm just an awful person to Pam, am I the bad guy?Edit: Pam has never been violent with me she only tells me things that are hurtful",

	"body" : "I (f22) have lived with my roommate (m25) for about 3 years now. We are good friends, we’ve had our ups and down, but have always pulled through.He can just be a generally dirty person. He never cleans his cat litter, I know he doesn’t shower that often. I’m the one who usually cleans and picks up the apartment.We have been a little on edge with each other, but I know it’ll die out in a week or so. I had some dog food  delivered to his grandmas house. he wanted to go pick it up but I had some other things going on so I asked if we could grab it tomorrow. His reaction threw me off because it seemed a little passive but he agreed we could go tomorrow. I would be the one driving anyways and it was not putting his grandma at any inconvenience.When I brought up later how I didn’t appreciate his response he completely denied it, even though I could repeat it to him word for word.Well today I was ready to go and just waited for him to get off work, I cleaned all snow off my car took a shower and all that. When I walked out I asked him if he was ready and he said yeah.he doesn’t have the best track record with things. I made him buy couch covers because his cats tore up the back of my couch. He’s always getting crumbs on them, one of the cushions started getting an indent because of how much he would sit in one spot. Sometimes they would even start to smell like his BO. He would get extremely defensive if I ever said any of this to him.before we were supposed to leave today, I noticed he was sitting in a way that made the couch lean weirdly. He’s a bigger dude, the way he was sitting was bending half of it in a weird way. He had his leg up and was pushed between the back and the side of it. There are two pieces of the couch so they are detached but they wouldn’t move like that without the extra pressure.I said politely “be careful how you’re sitting because it kind of looks like the couch is in a weird position.” He just didn’t say anything so I said hold on let me show you, so I took a picture and sent them. He still didn’t respond or even move. I got a little frustrated and said fine don’t move then.he started saying don’t start this and throwing his hands on his face in a dramatic way. I just said I wasn’t trying to do anything, just that I was asking him to be careful. He just got up and said fine I just won’t sit on the couch anymore. I was like that’s not what I’m trying to say. I decided that we both needed a minute, and that I was going to hang out in my room for a little sit and then we could go. He got mad and just decided to leave by himself.his brother who said I might have overreacted but when he saw the picture he said it looks like the couch was literally going to snap in half. And immediately said sorry and that he was going to say something to my roommate",

	"title" : "AITA for Using the Laundry Machine Too Much?",
	"body" : "This morning one of my roommates messaged in the group chat about our electricity bill being high. In the summer months, it's typically around $35. This month it was around $68. For reference, that is cheaper than last year, when we paid around $102. She said that she doesn't shower or do laundry much so she doesn't know why it could be high. Water is not included in our utility bill, but rather our rent, so I said that. I realize now that the laundry machine can use a lot of electricity, I just didn't consider that because we have a washer that claims to be efficient. Also, it's been very cold where we live. I said it's probably just the heating.Onto the issue at hand. I do about 6 loads of laundry a week: Towels, bedding, white clothes, athletic clothes, colors, and jeans. Maybe one extra load if I spill something on myself. By comparison, this roommate who messaged about the electricity bill does laundry maybe once a week. She never washes her sheets and towels. She's asked me once before why I do so much laundry, so I explained to her its because of my allergies. I'm literally allergic to dust so I have to wash my sheets and towels weekly, otherwise I get itchy. I also said that I do so many independent loads of laundry because I wash according to manufacturer directions. I spend a lot of money on my clothes so I want to keep them nice for a really long time, as to not waste money.I try to do my loads when no one else is in the house. If I plan on doing a bunch of loads back to back, I typically ask if anyone needs to use the machine before I start hogging it.Honestly I'm kind of peeved about her bringing this up, because she really isn't a great roommate. She consistently forgets to lock the door and turn off the stove. She and her boyfriend will cook until midnight at least three times a week (I have no issue with her using the kitchen, but she's very loud when she does it). She also leaves the kitchen a mess and doesn't do her dishes for days, making it really difficult to use the sink. She also goes out Thursday, Friday, and Saturday- which is fine, I'm glad she has free time - but its quite annoying when she comes back at 2 am and wakes me up by slamming the front door. She also doesn't contribute to any of the cleaning supplies unless specifically asked, and never restocks them herself because she doesn't have a car.The way that I view it, there's always give and take when you live with roommates. No one is perfect. Given I haven't actively been screaming at her about dishes and being loud, I feel that it's kind of unfair that she's complaining about my laundry usage.AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for how I handled this situation with my girlfriend's depression?",
	"body" : "Typically, I'm quite busy as a grad student, so I only get about an hour to myself at the end of the day sometimes before I have to prep for the next day and go to bed. During said hour, I often play video games. I'm very introverted, so my alone time is very valuable to me. Sometimes, I call my girlfriend (let's call her Jane) while I'm playing and talk with her while I play. She doesn't live with me, so it's how we catch up at the end of the day. Additionally, we are both aware that we sometimes will multitask while we are on the phone together and we are both ok with this.Last night around midnight, after Jane initially called me and we talked, she wanted to call again. She was depressed yesterday as well. Admittedly, I wanted to go ahead and go to sleep. I have to get up fairly early, my sleep is very important to me, and my social battery was pretty drained by the time she first called me last night. Further, her mood improved by that point and we had already talked about her depression in the earlier call.  It was our nine-month anniversary yesterday as well, but with both our busy schedules, we didn't get much chance to celebrate. This also influenced my decision. I felt bad telling her no, so I told her she could call me again.Twenty minutes later, she FaceTimed me back. I'll be honest: the twenty-minute time period frustrated me, but I tried not to let it show.  At one point on the call, I asked if she was ok. She said she was sleepy, so I told her she should go to sleep. She said no, because she wanted to talk to me. I told her I was going to go sleep soon anyways, which she seemed to be a bit upset about. I realized this, so I told her I'd stay on the call for ten more minutes. I figured \"ok, ten minutes gives her the extra time she wants, and gives me enough time to wind down to sleep at a decent hour\".Two minutes later, she suddenly wanted to hang up. I was already feeling guilty, because I felt like I wasn't being as patient as I could have, but I was also tired. I basically asked her if she wanted to hang up because of me. Long story short, through that exchange, she got confused and thought I said that I wanted her to hang up. She asked me if I wanted her to hang up, in a tone of voice that sounded hurt. Admittedly, I did not react the best to this. I got frustrated, and thoughtlessly rolled my eyes and sighed (I had forgotten she could see me) . In a tight, but not raised, tone of voice, I said \"no sweetie, I don't want to hang up, I want to know if you want to hang up\".This made her sad and this is the offense I'm asking about. My frustration in that moment was stemming from desperation and my own guilt. I felt bad because I was tired and wanted to sleep. I felt trapped because it seemed like no matter what I did, short of staying on the phone with her all night, I wasn't going to win. I wanted to know what she wanted. So, Reddit, AITA?",

I literally had to leave class later to finish up because she literally couldn’t do anything.So that following Monday I refused to work with her in front of her, I explained to my teacher, everything that was going on to where I was yelled at for bullying?

Last weekend I went to lunch with my mother and she was quite angry at something that happened during our wedding.During the reception my husband and I went away for a short while (like 40 minutes) to do a small fotoshoot with just the two of us. After that we went back to the reception to talk to everyone. Between reception and dinner we wanted to take some group portaits. However, we did not want to spend too much time on them, as we did not want to be away for long from the rest of our guests. So before the wedding we decided on 7 group compositions and shared these list with our photographer and MOH. She helped gather the people. The compositions were a bit like this:- me, husband, MIL, FIL, SIL, BIL- me, husband, father, grandfather- me, husband, grandparents, uncle and aunt (mothers side)- me, husband, mother, sister, sisters fiancé, brotherMy mother has been dating her new boyfriend (Eddy) 1 years and 4 months before our wedding day. We met him after 2 months of dating and have since seen him about 5-7 times. Each time there were around 12-14 people present and we were together for around 4 hours. These were also the only times I see my family, so I try to talk to everyone for a short time. Therefore, we have not spoken to him or gotten to know him very well and do not really have any connection with him yet. Therefore, we did not add him onto the list for the picture with my mom, sister etc. During the pictures, my mom came to ask me if it was correct that Eddy is not on the list. I said yes and continued with the next group.Last weekend was the first time I saw my mom one-on-one since the wedding. She told me Eddy and herself were very upset that he was not invited for the picture. I tried to explain that we did not want to spend to much time on the pictures, I did not know him very well and we did not form a connection yet. She said that they almost left the wedding because of this and they really thought we/I disliked Eddy. I told her I thought he was a very nice guy, from the short conversations we had. He was also seated second row during the ceremony, with his son, while my MOH was in third row (there were two rows of 4 seats next to on another, so quite tight), which I thought was a kind gesture. During the conversation, my mom and I did not get on the same page. I believe I did nothing wrong and the decision was up to me. She thinks we were in the wrong for excluding him.So, am I the asshole? I think I might be the asshole as I could have included 1 more compositon (so 8 total) to have one with Eddy and one without (my mom said this would have been better)",

I told him that I am very much straight to which he claimed that ‘Dove’ must be to make fun of Dean being gay and I must be homophobic. I told him he was being absurd and asked why I would be here if I was homophobic.Dean then came back to the table and Jay claimed that they should be heading out to get back before the roads got icier.

I felt like she would flirt with him. He did not flirt back but it still made me uncomfortable. Well when she went to stay with N she would tell me how hot he was and how she wanted to F*** him. When I dropped her off N was telling me how gorgeous I was and would love to take me out. Of course I rejected bc I was in a relationship. Well the next day she called me to tell me how they had F***** and proceeded to give me details. Then told me the next day they had done it again. Fast forward to now. She now has a new boyfriend and he found out about her and N and for some reason got mad even though he wasn’t in the picture at the time (I don’t think). He threatened to break it off if she didn’t tell him the truth if they slept together and now she is saying that N rapped her. So M’s new boyfriend told her dad and her dad made her press charges. So she is. She told me to stand by her side and testify that N rapped her. And I just don’t believe it. When I ask her why she lied to me and gave me all those details and was so happy.

We use acrylics, and I work with kids on the younger side, so I’m always bound to get paint on my hands and clothes. I have one hoodie that I’ve designated as a painting sweater. I usually wear it on colder days and naturally it’s accumulated quite a bit of paint.I have lectures that happen a few hours after both sessions. I’m not pressed for time or anything, and of course I thoroughly wash my hands after every session, but if I’m honest, I just can’t be bothered to change out of my sweater and put on a new one—it’s a hassle to shove another bulky sweater in my backpack when I’m already carrying so many other things (and that’s not to mention how wrinkly it would be once I took it out). Quite frankly, I don’t really care if I wear the painting sweater to lectures, and I don’t think anyone else does either.When I came downstairs this morning, my mom looked me up and down and asked me if I was bringing another sweater to change out of for class. I said no, and she started doing the classic mom “Okay, but I’m judging you for it,” thing; raising her eyebrows, repeating something akin to “That’s really weird, but whatever,”My mom, ever with a flair for the dramatic, then started equating my wearing a sweater with paint on it in public to not caring about my appearance, expressing her ‘concern’ that I don’t care at all how I look. This bothered me, because it’s just blatantly not true. Equating me wearing a sweater with paint on it to generally just looking unpresentable in public is not at all the same thing, and I told her as such. She just kept repeating her point and begging me to take it off before class (I have a shirt underneath, but it’s freezing today, I am keeping that sweater on).My question is basically if everyone else finds this weird/inappropriate for me to wear my painting sweater in public.

	"title" : "WIBTA for getting a new cat?",
	"body" : "Hello, I (20M) lost my cat of 18 years about a month ago. It's my first time losing someone and it's been pretty hard, especially cause usually when I'm sad or distraught I hug my cat, but now she is gone. I've been thinking of getting a new cat to bring a little more joy into my life and help with my grief, but I wasn't sure if it would be too short a time, so I consulted my family. My grandparents said I absoloutly should go get a cat if it helps me grieve and that it isn't too soon at all. My parents and sister also agree that getting a cat again would probably help us all, as we've all been pretty sad. The problem comes with my other sister, who says she is not ready. She isn't sure how long it will take her to be ready either. When she was a kid, she lost her cat and it took her a long time to get over it, she was still not ready by the time we got our recent cat (the one who just died) and she really hated our new cat for a while. I don't want to get a cat before she's ready and I certainly don'twant her to have distain for it, but I don't know how long that will take, last time it was years. I don't know if i can spend even another month without a cat. All my family is saying to get one anyway, and i really want to, but I don't want to prioritise my own grief over hers. Everyone grieves differently and it seems our grieving processes do not align very well. Would I be the asshole if I got a cat anyway? Should I wait a bit longer? Not get one at all? I'm not sure what to do. It's hard to think clearly with so much pain, but I certainly don't want to bring more pain to any of my family.Edit, as it may not have been clearWe do live together with our parents and other sister, so this cat would be in her living space as well as mine. If we lived seperate I wouldn't be too worried, I have a brother but he has moved out. It's mostly just cause I don't want to infringe on her space with a cat that will bring her more grief.",

Later when it was time for us to get some dinner, I noticed my roommate acting annoyed and not talking to me. So I put my spoon down and asked why she was acting that way and she said she couldn't study because I was talking and she has tests tomorrow (I did not know that) and that she's been stuck on the same chapter for 3hrs because of me. I told her I didn't know or if she'd let me know I'd reduce my volume or heck even cut the call. But she chose to be mad at me and act all annoyed for shit. I tried to make it better by telling her I won't dk it again and if she has issues she can speak up instead of acting this way. This changed the whole environment of the freaking room. And she said I should be mindful of others in the room (which I am). So, AITA for talking on call, unaware of her?",

We each have our own separate apartments, but for the past several months we’ve only been staying at her apartment. We don’t see each other during the winter and summer breaks because we live in separate towns so we have to do long distance.After this past summer break, I stayed over at her place several nights then she stayed over at mine. Eventually, it got to the point where I was just staying at her apartment every single night. Last semester, I felt like this was negatively affecting both of our schedules and our academics. I felt like we overindulged and stayed up/slept in too much. So when I first said that I wanted to sleep at my apartment on my own, she broke down and said that I hated her apartment and that I didn’t want to stay there anymore. I tried reassuring her that this wasn’t the case, and that I wanted to stay at my own apartment after it’s been so long and I thought my overall life balance was getting sloppy. I ended up staying at her place again that night. Since then I have tried a couple more times to sleep at my own apartment, even inviting her over to stay with me. But each time I try this, she either has a breakdown or gets really upset and says things like I don’t care about her, or that she feels like a second or third option, or that I always look miserable with her. It has even gotten to the point where she said she wanted to die and I panicked and tried my best to calm her down. I had also proposed sleeping at our own places during the week and sleeping with each other on the weekends but she really didn’t like that idea either.Recently when I was sleeping with her at her place, I had some issues sleeping due to some health conditions. So when I told her I planned on sleeping at my place because I felt like I could treat my health conditions there better, she got upset and said I don’t like to spend time with her.I understand how she can want to spend a lot of time with me because we don’t see each other over break, but I feel like we can still spend a lot of time without sleeping together every night. She’s also worried that we will see each other less after college, but I’ve told her that we can make it work, we still have so much time, and we can eventually sleep with each other every night if we get a place together and/or get married. Overall, it stresses me out knowing I can’t comfortably sleep in my own apartment without making her upset or sad. AITA?TL;DR: I have been staying over at my girlfriend’s apartment for several months, and when I try staying at my apartment she gets upset.",

My husband I are about to welcome our son in about a month, and I’m worried that the noise will make it hard for all of us to adjust. When I say they are loud I mean LOUD. Slamming things so hard that our walls shake, bloodcurdling screams and yelling is the only way they communicate, but doesn’t necessarily sound like abuse. It sounds like her kids version of playing is slamming every drawer and cabinet in the house, breaking things and overall play rough. I feel terrible because she’s a single mom and I can’t imagine how difficult it is for her, but I’m so worried that my baby isn’t going to sleep. I don’t want to call the police or property management and would rather handle it ourselves, but I don’t know if going to her with my concerns is even the right thing to do.

No, I’ve never had to buy food or litter, but responsibility almost 100% of the time falls on me to take care of said pets. We have 3 dogs and recently adopted 2 cats (against my wishes) that originally stayed in sisters room. After about 2 weeks she got tired of the cats (kittens at the time) and they ended up being handed off to me. I didn’t mind it too much but as time has gone on, they’ve ended up becoming more and more of a problem. I suffer depression and can hardly take care of myself, let alone 2 cats, both of which being extremely destructive and probably pent up from being trapped upstairs most of the time because of the 3 dogs. They tear up my chargers, knock everything off my dresser, and just generally tear holes/ destroy anything they come in contact with. I’m woken up usually 2 hours early every morning to get up to feed them and give them water. It’s not the fact I have the take care of them as much as it’s I have to take care of them by myself, and I get scolded if their water is too low, their food is too low, or if the litter box is a bit too smelly. I just don’t know what to do or how much longer I can handle their destruction. We’re getting a new dog at the end of this month as well, but my parents (specifically stepdad) have kicked and yelled at our other dogs before for misbehaving, but don’t take the time out of their day to train or at least take the dogs somewhere to be trained for their behavior.

My wife and I agreed to not have any visitors today, and to no let anyone else hold him, so he could rest…I went to the store to get some stuff for our son, and when I came home, I found my SIL on the couch, with the baby in her arms. This kind of triggered me, because I thought we had an agreement. She stayed around for his bath and after, when I was feeding the baby, he didn’t quite co-operate. She then said ‘we’re gonna teach him not to listen to you anyway’.For me, this triggered something. After a very short night, my wife completely disregarding our agreement and this remark made me feel disrespected in my own house.

We live in a 3rd world country where organised crime is nothing out of ordinary.My sister is seeing her fiancé “Mark” (21M, fake name used for privacy) since 2020. Mark comes from a pretty wealthy family that is basically a mob family. I don’t know the details, but he’s like a mafia prince or something, which means that his parents are the ones directly responsible for the stuff the criminal organisation does and he’s involved as well. Either way she’s deeply in love with Mark and they’re planning to get married in summer.Mark is a very nice and gentle man, he has wonderful manners, he’s always polite to my sister and the rest of our family. My sister says he’s a huge softie on the inside and is actually very kind. He definitely treats her well, he pays for her nails/lashes/etc, got her a new BMW car, supports her hobbies, takes her on expensive vacations. I hate to admit it but he’s a decent boyfriend.

I get that criminals are humans too and he didn’t choose what family he was born in, but I’m still not very happy to be around him. I’m also very scared for my sister because the crime world is super dangerous and I don’t want anything to happen to her.The conflict is that my sister wants me to be in the wedding ceremony. She’s not very social and most of her friends emigrated after the war in our country broke out, so obviously she wants me to be one of the bridesmaids along with her future SIL.

I don’t even want to attend it, let alone being in the ceremony.Our parents think that it’s her life and she should make her own decisions. They don’t openly disapprove of their future wedding and are obviously going to attend. My sister is very upset that I don’t want to be a part of her wedding.

	"title" : "AITA for wanting to be healthier?",
	"body" : "I (18F) recently realized how unhealthy my lifestyle is. I've never had a big appetite and I always tend to gravitate toward unhealthy foods. I spent the last 6 months almost extensively eating junk food and snacks, without a healthy dish in sight, while this behavior has been permitted and supported by my mom solely because she considers me to be thin. And while yes, I do *look* relatively thin (my weight is healthy for my height) - I've been completely neglecting my health. I don't work out or even move much in my day-to-day life.I've been aware of how harmful this behavior is for a while now, but I recently decided to make a change. I started working out, researching healthy meals, and cutting out most of the unhealthy foods I'm used to consuming. I informed my mom of this change almost immediately, and she seemed to be supportive of the idea. She even helped me pick out and buy some yogurts I wanted to try. But her support didn't last very long.I had a busy day today, which didn't leave me enough time for proper meal prep, and in addition - my appetite was just generally low. Even so, I stuck to my new routine and made sure to eat healthy foods such as carrots and yogurt (otherwise, I would most likely eat sweets and ramen noodles).By the time my mom came back from work, I got distracted and hadn't eaten a proper meal in a couple of hours. My mom then decided to order me a pizza without telling me a thing. You'd assume a pizza would be shared between the family members - but I'm the one tasked with eating it whole since my mom is insistent on me eating more. I got a bit upset when I was told about the pizza, not because I'm ungrateful - but because I made it clear to my mom that I'd like to cut off these foods from my diet. I communicated my feelings to my mom but she, on the other hand, got angry while claiming I don't eat enough since I'm \"too thin\".This resulted in an argument in which I explained how I was planning on eating a healthy dinner later on, but my mom was convinced I was starving just because of my weight. (I should probably mention how she tends to fat-shame my sister, who looks chubbier than me but leads a very healthy lifestyle - which is pretty frustrating to me).I might be the asshole for not realizing how worried my mom gets when I don't eat what she considers to be enough, and perhaps I didn't immediately show my gratitude towards her for ordering the food (although I made this clear later on). I'm truly taking care of myself and didn't eat more simply because I wasn't hungry, but I can see why she got worried. I tried to talk it out with her, but she's still very upset with me - to the point of crying and refusing to hug me - so I feel bad, but I'm also struggling to understand how I could've communicated this in a better way to her.AITA?",

There are 4 cats, with 5 litter boxes (litter boxes where the litter and bin smell so bad since they never change it), the cats are on a special diet, and need to be feed at a certain time in the evening when I would normally start getting ready for bed. I was always exhausted after taking care of the cats because of the work involved, the smell gets to me, and I have to make sure I am not taking anything back to my house as my partner (32M) is allergic to cats. My partner and I even ended up getting strep throat while I was over taking care of the cats last time as her and her fiancé (28M) had strep and didn't disinfect the house.I do live about 10 minutes from my friend, and am feeling that that leaves me as her default.I told this friend before that I think the cat litter or urine/feces makes me feel ill and she has still been asking me to cat-sit. Additionally, I have told this friend recently that I am dealing with some health issues and am feeling too tired to even cook food. Because of the health issues, I often wake-up in the middle of the night in pain. I also told her that I am not going to be able to see a specialist until the end of next month (due to the specialist's schedule) to look into the health issues.I am almost afraid to text her at this point and dread seeing her name pop-up on my phone because I know it's not going to just be casual conversation; it will be because she wants me to do her a favor. Last time, I ended up saying 'no' as it was during New Year's, I wanted to decompress from work stress, and we were visiting family.Recently, I got a message from her telling me she was going on vacation again for her birthday and she wanted me to cat-sit for a week. I really want to say 'no' as my health has not been the greatest and I am feeling so much fatigue. I even had trouble making stirfry the other day.

I’ve asked questions like what salary does she expect to have when she gets her first job, will she need any licenses/certifications to do her job, does she plan to work for the government or go private etc. She didn’t have any answers. Okay fine, I said it’s early and she’s probably still trying to figure it out.A couple days ago, I asked her some of the same questions. I specifically said something along the lines of “Hey, how much does a Dental hygienist makes straight out of school? I’m trying to do the math on how much of a hit our finances will take once I leave my job”. She said she doesn’t know. I said “Have you been thinking about this stuff at all!? We need to make sure we’re still going to be financially stable once I quit. This is serious stuff, we have a kid now to support it’s best to start thinking about this stuff as early as possible”.

	"body" : "Hi there my name is Victoria (not my real name) and im 24. I just had a baby and shes 4 months old. I recently moved out of my apartment that i initially got with my ex because it was to expensive to pay on my own. For a little backstory my ex who is the father of my child moved out a year ago and we broke up 5 months into my pregnancy, he is 30. We were together for 5 years, it wasnt a perfect relationship and we had our arguments. One day he decided to tell me while i was admitted into the hospital due to a health condition that he was moving out in 2 weeks. Never gave me a heads up or anything. The lease wasnt broken because it was to expensive to do that so he left with his name still on it. We had a one bedroom apartment so i really couldn’t get a roommate either. We still were together for the next 7 months and i was on birth control for years but it failed me this one time. We didnt really talk much during my pregnancy, he didnt show up for the birth of our daughter. He did visit us in the hospital after she was born. We were doing great until my lease was up and we both knew i couldnt afford rent since im not working because im attending school. Im on public assistance and receiving financial aid but that wasnt enough. I have no family or friends that can help out. He knew i was struggling but never offered to help out. He has a house, i never asked him to help me because i was scared he was going to say no. I did speak to him and he reluctantly took me and his daughter in. To make things clear i told him i would take the couch and not sleep with him in his bed. Getting back with him is not my goal or plan just to make things clear. He makes it so obvious that he doesnt want us here and he even told me that on his days off he wants me and his daughter out of the house until 10pm. AITA if i convince or “manipulate” as he puts it, for letting me stay at his house on his days off? I have a 4 month old baby i cant be walking around with her in the cold. That would disrupt her schedule. Also in the beginning he was sending me links to a homeless shelter. I have to endure him for the time being i don’t feel comfortable with this situation but i have no other choice, he’s an ex for a reason. You guys have no idea how much i sacrificed and lost over the years just to be with him and this is the treatment i get. I met him when he had nothing besides a car and he was living in crappy dusty room only for him to screw me over, i end up homeless and he ends up with his own apartment. In the end i acknowldge that it was my fault for ever dating a guy like him and sticking with him through out the years and i take this whole situation as a lesson learned and it gives me even more reason not to get back with him and to put him on child support. So is he the asshole or am i?Edit: I do want to put out there and remind everyone im on public assistance i asked my case worker for resources and everything she gave me wasn’t available. I called shelters and they were full; i live in CA and it’s winter. Again i don’t have family and the very few friends i have are gone now thanks to my ex. I don’t have the money for a hotel or Airbnb. My ex was my last resort/ option. So to the people who are saying there are options, there isn’t and to the people who are saying stop with the excuses, there aren’t any. Since im on public assistance my child support is not going to kick in until late summer according to my case worker.",

	"body" : "So myself 25f and my fiance 28m have been engaged for 3 years. For context i have always wanted 2 bridesmaids, my sister and my best friend. My fiancée asked me to ask his sisters to be bridesmaids f21 and f33 basically because there his sisters and he wants them involved in the wedding, which I understand. So last year I asked his sisters to be bridesmaids and they both said yes, I was hesitant about doing this in the first place but thought it'd he nice to have my future sister in laws as bridesmaids. Fast forward to now, me and my partner had a rocky patch between asking them to be bridesmaids and now, he vented to his sisters about me and its now created an argument because he was talking to his older sisters on facetime and my partner couldn't answer one of the wedding related questions (guest count and who's invited) because he's quite forgetful when it comes to the wedding, so I answered. This seemed to anger his older sister as she thought I was butting in,  little sister then also stated that when they are talking to there brother on facetime then they are talking to just him, not both of us,  this is when were sat next to each other for context. Alongside the fact that she wants us to invite her husbands family to the daytime, at this point we are already at capacity for the amount of guests that we have invited, but my fiancée stated that he would invite some of them to the day if people who are currently invited say no. We were hoping to reduce the guest list a little bit to save some money as jts roughly £110 per person for the day and if we could save some money that would be great as Weddings are super expensive. His sister still seemed to be annoyed about this fact as she states that there his family too now, which I get but my fiancée should be able to choose who he wants to be invited and not feel pressured into inviting people, I think. After all of this I'm feeling deflated and like my future sister in laws don't respect my fiancée and my decisions regarding our own wedding and feel like they don't support us, so WIBTA for asking them to be guest greeters instead of bridesmaids so they can spend time with my fiancée on the morning of the wedding rather than with me when I feel like they don't like me?",

After we got engaged i went round to my mums house and she was happy for me (at least i thought she was). We was planning a party/ evening meal with friends and close family members when she told me not to bother as it was after Christmas no one had any money etc.. so i thought we could wait. We never ended up celebrating our engagement in the end. Fast forward to July/ early august 2023 my mum met her new partner they hit it off very fast and he proposed to her 2 days before Christmas day 2023. Any way shes upset that no one has sent her an engagement card or even offered to sort out a meal to celebrate her getting engaged. I expressed that i haven’t sent her one/ why should we celebrate because she wasn’t interested in my engagement looking back none of my family members was. She pointed out that my engagement wasn’t a ‘real’ engagement because he proposed when i had an argument with my aunt stormed out and went to the bathroom opened the door and he was there with the ring (we have never been the romantic ones) its a funny story now and i love telling it. Any way i got angry with my mum for stating my engagement wasn’t real ( i also need to point out I don’t wear my ring because i put on some weight when having my 2 kids i wear it around my neck instead) so now my aunt has arranged an engagement meal and a nice restaurant and i really don’t want to go.

For anyone gonna ask my mom doesn’t have a problem with me going and my dad is out of the picture. The only time we speak is when he is venting to me about how the $200 a month for 4 kids is ruining his life (which he never even pays).

When she moved back into my house I have realize something. I realized that I thought her life was so good that I wanted that life too. About in December after Christmas I decided to go with the idea of the other school. It sounded really good and every time I heard someone talk about it is was always amazing things. I decided to ask my mom to make an interview and apply me. When I went to the interview it went amazing. I think my mind is set on it and I don’t really care what other people have to say anymore. The only thing I am scared of is telling my family. They are very judgmental and once you tell someone one thing the whole world needs to know. (If you know me and life by my area once you know my last name that ask if I know my aunt. Literally 3 towns over everyone knew my grandmas death before I did).

	"body" : "For some background, I (15F) live in Canada while my dad (49M) lives in Europe. He moved away when I was 9 because he was an alcoholic and my parents were constantly fighting. For as long as I can remember, my dad has always drunk in obscene amounts. While I now know why and sympathize for him, I can’t help but be angry at him for causing this amount of damage to my life. Due to the drinking and the added stress of money problems, my parents fought constantly as I grew up. Multiple times, the fights and my father’s state caused my mother to call the police to our home. I cannot say if there was anything physical between my parents but the most concerning action I can remember was when my father poured a glass of water on my mothers head. Even as my father moved away, the drinking stayed an issue. Now to get to the point. My father came here to visit and stayed for a few weeks. The first week went fine, but then he began drinking again. We went to our cabin along with my little sister and it was all going fine until we had to go back home. The issue started with my sister begging me to sit in the front seat. I could tell my father was borderline drunk so I told her no, because if we possibly crashed due to him not being fully sober, she would be out of harms way. Because of this, she was very angry with me for the rest of the day. Meanwhile, I knew I had made the right choice as my father decided it would be a great idea to drink more as we drove. (and I say this with heavy sarcasm) He began saying ridiculous things, like he would die very soon and that the phone works both ways and if I loved him I would move to Europe with him. I began full on crying because I was stressed and I didn’t want to hear about him dying or about the other crap he was spouting. We finally got home and a couple of hours, and a six pack later, he barged into my room with a new mattress. Saying that the last thing he wanted to do for me before he left was to get me a proper mattress to sleep on, even though I was already happy with what I had. I was angry because he was drunk and stressed because I earlier and began pushing him away and telling him to get out. This caused my older sister to get angry at me and I could tell my father was very hurt. I know I messed up because my father’s mental state is very fragile, and my sister was angry at me for yelling. I regret yelling at him, so I need another opinion. Am I The Asshole?",

Ever since Sam moved in with me a few months ago, I have tried to include him with my friend group as much as possible. They got along very well and I would say Sam is now part of the core friend group.EVENT: The other day, I had a party/potluck at our townhome apartment. It was a fairly large function (12 people total), all of whom Sam knows and is friends with. I cooked food for everyone, and some of the friends brought stuff to cook also. Sam was having a good time and definitely engaged in the function. Overall successful function, but because of the cooking the kitchen was pretty dirty.ISSUE: The day afterwards, I woke up and started cleaning up the mess from the party. I saw my roommate Sam and asked him to help clean the apartment. I had already taken care of all of the dishes and cups, i just wanted help cleaning the tables and putting away the cleaned dishes. My roommate said that he would help, but was upset that he felt like I \"expected\" him to help clean. He said, since it was my party, it is my responsibility to clean and I shouldn't \"expect\" him to help clean.That really upset me, but i tried to stay civil and explain my side of it. He engaged with the event, ate food, I even made him a bowl of spaghetti. Sam agreed to clean reluctantly, but didn't feel like I should \"expect\" that out of him. Like how you wouldn't expect one of the guests to help clean. Ultimately, he cleaned for maybe 5 minutes max while we argued, and I did the lions share (95%) of the cleaning.Another thing that he was upset about was that I didn't ask him for permission to have the party/potluck. I assumed he would be okay with it. I didn't feel the need to ask him permission since I invited him to the event (of course) and our friend group is basically the same. We have had events like this in the past and it seems like he enjoys and engages with them.TLDR: Had a party at my place. Invited the friend group (which my roommate Sam is a part of). Sam engaged with the party and had a good time. Asked Sam of help clean afterwards. He doesn't feel like I should \"expect\" him to clean since it was my party.AITA???",

	"body" : "I (m25) and my girlfriend (f24) have been at odds about this for a while but it came to a head recently. She wants to get a dog for our new place while I am against it. I've owned dogs before and love them as much as she does, but in this stage of my life I don't think that the responsibility of dog ownership meshes with the steps we need to take as we assemble the rest of our lives. In addition, the joy that a dog brings to life is a beautiful thing, but the loss is unbearable every time. I've lost more dogs in my life than I think anyone should, and I really don't want to mourn another one. We've talked about it for a while and I've been transparent about why I don't want one, but it feels to me like she refuses to look at things from my perspective. I know why she wants a dog, and if things were different so would I, but we don't have the space or the means lined up to handle dog expenses and the proper time to give the pup the attention it deserves. Not only am I not sure if I'm TAH about this, I'm a little lost how we could compromise either. AITAH?",

	"body" : "I (17F) babysit various kids in the town I live in, including a twelve year old boy who we’ll call ”Freddie”. The topic of his english lessons this term is gothic literature, particularly Frankenstein.He wanted to watch the film of Frankenstein but his mum had specifically told me not to allow him to watch anything rated for above his age and I didn’t really want to push it with PG-13 so we looked through various gothic films and he picked Edward Scissorhands. It is rated 12 so I thought it was pretty much perfect.He wasn’t terrified by it - apart from saying that the town itself made him feel uneasy. But the next morning he told his mum about what he’d watched and she was furious. She called me and said I should never have let him see that film because he’s not mature enough. She said it’s too scary for him, that I’m lucky he isn’t traumatised because of it and I should never have shown him a film with death in it because children aren’t able to handle that.I apologised but said he wasn’t scared when watching it and that I explained the premise of it beforehand and he was okay with it. She said I shouldn’t make excuses for my negligence and that I won’t be working for her again.It seemed fine to me at the time because the rating followed her rules, but I guess I should have put it together that she meant “don’t show him anything scary”. I also think that the scene where that woman takes off her clothes is not something Freddie should have seen, although it happens in a surprising amount of films. I’d forgotten about that part.Was I the asshole?Edit: we watched it on Disney+, where the age rating is 12+",

We've hung out on a few occasions and we text semi-regularly. However, every time Jenae and I make plans or post photos when we're out, Destiny consistently texts us to ask us several questions (i.e. \"where are you guys\", 'when did you make this plan?\"). It indicates that she doesn't feel particularly great about the fact that she wasn't invited, without blatantly saying so.We do hang out with Destiny together also, but Jenae and I also prefer to have our own time together without feeling obligated to invite Destiny each time. However, I don't want to make it seem like we only invite Destiny out of convenience when we feel like hanging out with her. It feels almost as though the friendship is being forced to be closer than it is. Destiny has a couple of friends, but has fallen out with many of her previous friends.Additionally, she consistently tries to get in touch with our friends by following them on social media or feeling entitled to be invited to every one of our plans and be introduced to other people we hang out with.For instance, Jenae and I are planning a trip soon, and we know that she will feel upset if she isn't invited.

The relationship has never been established, conflicts have been frequent and also tensions with my husband, who is more accommodating and rightly feels love towards her.Two years ago, we have had the opportunity to purchase a beach house, and we decided to take it in their region, it made it easy for her to come and spend some time with her grandson (my BIL doesn't drive).First year, everything was beautiful and she was very happy.Second year, she was tight on money (BIL has a loss-making shop and she pays off his debts with her pension), and she didn't want to come.Since we don't ask for money, we insisted, and in the end she agreed to come for ten days.For ten days she didn't say a word. Literally. She sat on the terrace looking outside, she didn't speak to her nephew, the only words she uttered was to complain that we didn't let her make houseworks. She blatantly tried to eat as little as possible. My son often asked why granma ignored him even when they were alone.Now. She's 80 and she doesn't know better, but she probably suffers from anxiety, and one can totally understands her difficulty and discomfort.But those ten days were very long. Once accepted, you have to overcome the first impact, you cannot behave like this. I know, because I suffer from anxiety and not even in my worst crises did I treat the people around me this way.My husband keeps insisting that that was not directed at us, it was her shame not to have money with her. I insist that it was the alibi she gave herself to justify a behavior that she herself would have stigmatized if she had heard it done by someone else.Unfortunately, after twenty years of efforts and attempts to meet her (I agreed to organize a second wedding reception in the village, so that she could invite whoever she wanted and have the traditional wedding of the son she so desired), I reached the point of breaking up, and six months after, I can't get over it, I limit any interaction, I don't have no  intention to invite her to participate in our life again.We wanted to be a family, but I think  that no good deed goes unpunished.AITA?",

There was many issues with her especially when it came to my son.Fast forward to 2023, I am pregnant with our 3rd child a boy, also my last due to many medical issues. She suckered us into being back in her house by keeping our saved up money claiming it went to bills (it definitely didn't) we wanted to move out of state with my brother to create our own healing space. But she kept the money and said we could live with her rent free and she promised to be more respectful. She took the rent free part back in less than a month.Boy were we wrong. 2023 was the worst year with her. She blatantly disrespected me and my husband. My son was born on the same day as my oldest son, so I was at the hospital obvi and I asked her to bring my son and daughter to meet their brother, she made a big deal about it and when she got there she rushed it. My son started talking about picking up a cake and she said she just got him a cake I made her promise me in the hospital before she left not to throw a birthday party without me. Me and my newborn son come home there are obvious party stuff left over we throw him a party the next weekend and my son tells everyone he already had a party...and this is when shit really hit the fan.My mil kicked us out bc my mom came over, yes. That's all that happened. My mom came over I was breastfeeding my baby and sent my husband upstairs to make me a sandwich. She cornered him yelled about how disrespectful we were for bringing her into HER house she made that very clear. She never had issues with my mom before so we were more than confused. We pack up the kids and my mom and go to leave for her house she is saying nasty things TO MY BABIES. She begins to scream and clap at my husband who is almost to the car I am a couple feet infront of her with my kids and I turned and asked her to stop yelling in front of them and she told me to shut up.

	"body" : "EDIT: Thanks, you guys.So, long story short, I've been dating this girl for a while. I'll just call her \"Gabby\" for the sake of the post. She's mostly very sweet; we often play games together as a hobby, since we're living far apart for the moment. A few weeks ago, since we were celebrating 2023 Christmas, I've decided to take part in the Steam sales and give her a game that was on her wishlist; it was a co-op game, and I made it clear I wanted us to play it together. She accepted it, and at the time, thanked me profusely.We're both busy, so we didn't really get a chance to play it together up until the day of today (Jan 19), which was when I asked her if she was up to it. Gabby then sent me a text saying that she'd play it with me, but that she honestly wasn't all that hyped for it since - in her own words - she \"thought the game was kinda trash\".At that point I was a tad bit confused, but I took it lightly, and jokingly asked why she had it in her wishlist if she didn't like it (otherwise, i'd have given her something else). She said she just kind of \"forgot\" it there. Alright, I thought that could still work out, and incentivized her further to give it a shot with me, then maybe she'd change her mind about it? She accepted.Few minutes later, Gabby sent me a \"joke\". Said we couldn't play the game anymore due to a error in her Steam. I asked which error, she answered with: \"It says here that my Steam can't download shitty games\". Now, normally i'd be laughing at that kind of thing, just messing around and stuff. No biggie. BUT, considering Gabby had already said she really didn't like the game (despite being wishlisted), it felt like those kind of jokes with a little bit (or a lot) of truth to it. With that in mind, I got a little hurt, thinking she was belittling my gift, so I just told her to stop.She didn't.That's when I got defensive, and said those exact words:\"If the game is so trash, then you know you could've just hit 'refuse', right? It would be kinder than having to hear you say how shitty my gift was at every 5 minutes.\"Which offended her. She answered with:\"What? I'm here, still accepting to download and play with you despite not being that much into it, just for you to get angry and say THAT to me? Seriously? For real?\"After that, it was just us arguing and being rude to eachother. It wasn't pretty, but not important enough to convey in words. Alas; I ended the discussion saying that I was disappointed she was acting like that, and that i'd only talk to her again if she apologized for such behaviour. She told me not to count on it.For context: Essentially, her point was that I was being unreasonable since she was just \"joking around\", and I was making her look ungrateful. Those weren't her exact words, but it was all I could gather from what she was saying, since the situation is a tad bit confusing for me as well.So, did I overreact because of some \"jokes\"? Was I unreasonable? Am I the asshole indeed?",

	"body" : "I (F28) have been with my bf (M31) for 5.5 years now. We’ve been living together for 4.5.We were supposed to go to a cinema this weekend, it was supposed to be a date. It is important to me, because our relationship is not in a good place now - we don’t go out, our bedroom life is non existent. We do love each other, I know that for sure, but we are not as close as we used to be.As it turns out, my bf’s friend bought a ticket to the same screening, so now the date turned into friends going out. Tbh I didn’t mind that - I understand that it would be awkward to sit in the cinema together knowing that his friend is sitting somewhere in the crowd as well. We might as well sit together and hang out. Its a bummer, but whatever.Knowing that our alone time is not happening anymore, I said to my bf “It’s fine that your friend is coming with us, but now you owe me a date on Sunday”. Guys… His face told me everything. He let out the biggest sigh and rolled his eyes in the most theatrical way. A date with me is clearly a chore (mind you in the last 12 months we went out 3 times). He quickly realised what his reaction was and quickly apologised, saying that he didn’t mean it. I got so sad realising that he isnt excited to be spending time with me.I left the bedroom, he followed me and we had a chat about our feelings. He claims he didn’t mean to react this way and he is excited to spend time with me. We kind of made up after that, but I cannot stop thinking about it. I feel like guilty for overthinking and overreacting, because maybe he genuinely didn’t mean it and he is starting a therapy to sort out his problems and possibly improve our relationship. He did ask me to wait for him and be patient. AITA for doubting in this relationship?",

He also had his son (8M) which i pretty much took care of the entire time.Anyways I decided to moved to state B to be with my family since they has more free time and wanted me to move so they can help and take care of me. i decided to move and told POS i was moving, he was upset that i decided to move pack my furniture and get rid of my housing.

	"title" : "AITA for \"sleeping in\"?",
	"body" : "We have 2 small kids, 6 and 2 years old. I have a full time job and my wife has mostly been a homemaker since the 6 yo was born. For medical reasons, we have opted not to send the 2 yo to daycare, so at this point my wife is not receiving any mat leave and I am supporting the family on my salary.Despite this, I try to contribute what I can to the household. I admit I still do less than 50% of the total work around the house, but I’m genuinely interested in helping when I can. For example, and this is the topic of this post, we take turns getting the kids in the morning when they wake up too early.Also important is that my wife is what I call “nap-racist”. She gives me stink-eye whenever I try to take a nap. She was simply never a napper, always complaining that napping makes her feel groggy. Also, she’s much more anxious than I am, always putting upkeep of the house and children ahead of her own self care. My wife honestly doesn’t understand the concept of “self care,” and so is constantly nearing burnout trying to do everything for everybody but herself. Often I wonder if she sees me putting myself first (for ex: by resting) as selfish or lazy, even if it doesn’t inconvenience anyone. If my wife ever wants to nap, I’m always super supportive.Which brings us to the debate. When the 2 yo was a baby and would be up at 5am screaming hysterically and refusing to return to sleep, what to do was brutal but pretty straightforward— pick up the kid, take them far away from the other kid, and let the partner rest.Nowadays, they wake up a few times a night, usually needing a cuddle. When I go to get them, the whole procedure takes at most 2 min and they go back to trying to sleep. When my wife goes, the kid supposedly really wants her and freaks out when she leaves them, so it “takes longer”. I don’t really know why it should “take longer”, but I suspect if she tries to put them down quickly, they lose it because they know my wife will give in. Our morning family routine starts at 7:15. If the toddler is up at 6:30 and it’s my turn to get them, I go to put them back. Over half the time they lie there until 7 am. My wife thinks this is completely unfair, if the kid is up at 6:30 she just starts her day. She says that if SHE tries to put the baby back they’ll scream and she wouldn’t be able to rest anyway. But what I do on my mornings is ruining my wife’s sleep-in because the child calls for us later anyway.I genuinely don’t see her point. Wouldn’t it be better for both of us to be as rested as possible (especially if napping during the daytime is bad)? But she felt super passionate about it, even raising her voice this morning about how unfair this was (while the kid is trying to chill in their bed, mind you). I don’t know what to say. I think this is just her nap-racism sneaking in. This is why I wanted a third party’s opinion.So, AITA for trying to sneak in another 30-45 minutes of sleep when everyone’s still resting in the morning?",

Refused to commit, said he didn’t trust me, so i backed off and told him to go figure his shit out. His behavior was so hot and cold all year. Well i haven’t seen him in 4 months, our last convo, he still wasn’t ready for a commitment. My ex sent 2 candles worth 700$. He’s 39, I’m 33. He said some of the most cruel things to me the last time we spoke, it’s been 3 months. He told me every little thing I’ve done this year is a red flag. Despite him not telling me what his plans are, lying to me, he expected me to be devoted to him, and to be an angel this year, to win him back. He’s called me a narcissist, he’s questioned whether I’m too old to become another at this point in my life, he says things then denies doing them… he’s made me question my reality. Essentially I’m over him, and would never get back together after the things he said. I guess I’m just over his 39yo shenanigans! Who sends 700 dollar candles to somebody they described as a walking talking red flag?!i ended up sending the candles back. I put them in a box with the shit he left at my house over the course of the year. He lives with his mom and dad, in their basement. His family likely has no idea that he was still talking to me. So i put the candles in a box with his clothes, and wrote on the box “here’s everything you left at my house this year as well as the candles you just sent me. Gifts without an intent or emotion behind them, are pointless.” He messaged me and said “i can’t say I’m not shocked that you would send a box like this to my house. What good did you think would come from this.” Idk why he response makes me so mad. The fact that he doesn’t realize how manipulative his behavior has been is mind boggling.They’re Thompson Ferrier Candles, btw. I know everyone’s going to ask. He sent my mom a candle last year too. When i asked why he would send my mom a gift, he said he was just wanting to do something nice. Completely didn’t understand how that would mess with my moms emotions and make my parents feel like he wanted to have more of a relationship with themSo am i the asshole for sending the candles back the way i did? I feel like i might be the asshole because i chose not to let it go.TLDR; i sent my ex his gifts back, am i the assjole for sending it back the way i did?",

It’s not in the least bit true. Every single time he comes around it’s a shit show and I’m damned if I do damned if I don’t in the eyes of his brother. That being said I would never say he wasn’t allowed in my home.I pleaded with my husband to give me at least a months heads up if he wants us to host a guest in our 1200 sq ft 3 bedroom 1 bathroom home. He said you KNOW my brother won’t be able to hold on to his money that long so that’s basically saying to me that he can’t come.” I thought over that and it’s true if we waited he prob would blow his money and agreed. I dropped my annoyance about it until yesterday when I was told that his brother had left and would be here today. I started panicking and got pretty much furious that I was told something else. My husband steam rolled over me saying he always had said he’s coming Thursday to which I reminded him that he has said “he was coming Thursday so arriving Friday” (he said this while I was arguing that it was too many days) so that’s why I was planning on Friday. I honest to God feel like he’s gaslighting me. He buckled down with the narrative that he’s been saying Thursday this entire time. He HAS been saying my brothers coming Thursday but because he said word for word “coming Thursday so he’ll be here Friday” I had no other reason to assume it would be today. It FEELS like he said it to shut me up about the length of stay in the moment and now he’s just gaslighting the shit out of me.I communicated that I wished  he would have said to me “hey I know it’s a lot to ask but my brother has the ability to come visit us. I know it’s short notice and a long stay but I’d really like to see him.” Vs dropping it on me as if its no big deal and that I should be even excited. I was bringing up things I expected from my husband (not being a drunk mess etc) and he went in on me to just get along. I told him that I do just to have  his bro get on Facebook and post about me being a bitch and my husband said “gee I wonder why look at you right now” and I LOST it. I was shaking flipped him off pushed him out of our room and locked the door. I’m not proud of it. I ended up apologizing. My husband did ask what he could do to ease my worries and I asked he just consider me and that he holds his brother to the same standards as me. I told him that if I treated his brother the way he treated me he’d leave me. He said “yes, but I hold you to a higher standard than him.” Idk really what to think of that.AITAH for getting upset with my husband for not giving me enough notice?

My mom left for vacay for two weeks and after she left he took it upon himself to tell me my bf can't stay past 11 even though we're both adults (I'm 21 and he's 22) and we also are very considerate. We don't cause noise we literally just talk and watch movies after I put my daughter to sleep. He approached us in a very condescending and rude manner as if we are 14. I asked him why and if he had talked to my mother about it because my mother had never has a problem with him staying late. He said no he didn't talk to my mom and barely gave a reason on why he has to leave. He basically told us we had to obey this and that he is the authority figure without any discussion.

She said he can stay for 6 months to help him out so he can get a new job and place.. Me and my bf didn't think much of it and honestly took it as a joke or suggestion. We continued hanging out past 11 whenever he would come over making sure to be mindful of noise and just be in my room chillin. Nobody else in the house has ever complained of his presence including the owner of the house, my mom. This morning he came to me with once again a very condescending and rude tone. Saying we dishonored him and disobeyed him so now my bf isn't allowed to come over at all and he will call the police if he even steps foot in the house.

Yesterday was my older nephews birthday and I told my sister I would go. When I was getting ready to go I was just absolutely dreading it. I had already seen my nephew that day, said happy birthday, and given him a present. I thought to myself why am I going to go put myself through an evening of being surrounded by these shitty people who make me feel like crap? So I didn’t go.It wasn’t the first time I chickened out of a family event, a couple months ago when it was my younger nephews birthday I didn’t go. My sister got mad at me, I apologized and said I was uncomfortable going, and we got over it. But my sister is PISSED about me not going to my nephews party yesterday. She said she was disappointed in me and I replied to her text saying that I’m sorry she was hurt and I should’ve told her sooner I wasn’t going but I’ve decided to no longer visit the family. It felt like a weight had been lifted off of my shoulders, finally saying that I’ve had enough. My sister than texted me saying“Well you know what maybe I shouldn’t of made you the godmother if you can never show up for my kids or me that’s how I feel. Do what you want don’t expect anything from me”To which I replied,“I’m always there for you and your kids, and respectfully, you need to understand and respect my boundaries. Your family is not my family. They have hurt me in the past and it is my choice as an adult to not have a relationship with them. I am always there for your children and I always will be. I am your sister, and I hope that you can remember that and understand that my choices are my own and are not made with the intention to hurt you. I’m setting boundaries now that I am building my own life and growing up and this is one you’re going to have to learn to be okay with.

I love Anna, but I’ve noticed that she can be too quick to trust and believe people sometimes, and the most recent example of that has left her very upset and single. It started last fall when she decided to enroll in culinary education classes. One of the instructors, a man in his 40s, had Anna in his office for a one-on-one discussion about some exam, and he apparently reciprocated her flirting. She’d been telling me since the classes started that she found his attractive, and I tried to remind her that he’s her teacher, probably married, and that her last relationship with a man more than twice her age didn’t pan out (she really likes older guys).She brushed me off, insisting he wasn’t married because he didn’t wear a ring, and that this was all legit because he told her he’d “never even thought of doing something like this before.” I didn’t believe it, I didn’t trust it, but I didn’t want to act like an overbearing mother (she got very upset and defensive any time I tried to point out that this seemed fishy) so I stepped back and let her make her own decisions. Just before winter break, Anna ended up finding out that he IS actually married, that this isn’t his first affair, and it wasn’t even his only affair going on at that time. She has been swinging back and forth between anger and sadness over this whole thing, and I honestly believe she kind of manufactured her misery here. Even under better circumstances, pursuing staffers at your place of education is a bad idea for everyone involved.When the topic came up between me and another friend, I confided that I thought Anna was naive for going after the guy and believing the most cliche explanation ever (the “I’ve never done this before” thing). I thought I could trust this friend to keep it to theirself, but they told the entire friend group, including Anna. I got mixed reactions. Some friends are berating me, some are on my side, and some think I was right but should’ve kept it to myself. Anna is PISSED and hasn’t spoken to me since it happened, after which she sent me a long paragraph text about what a bad friend I am and then apparently blocked me.

He said no, he would lock it all the time if we lived in those areas.We already had a string of package thefts in the neighborhood. Yet he continues this. What can I do so we don’t get home invaded or robbed?Edit: he is now trying to beat the security system by locking the deadbolt from inside but leaving the door still cracked open. But it was a windy day and the door fully opened.How can this be fixed?",

	"body" : "I 29f was living in a one bedroom apartment with my 4yo son and bf at the time. We were having dinner and the phone rang. It was my friend “Lisa” I answered the call like any other.Backstory on “Lisa” I’ve known her since high school and she was always someone I could talk to. We have helped each other through some difficult times. Ex: when she got pregnant by multiple semi pro baseball players. I would always be the first one she would call. Vise Versa. She would always ask me for rides to places, for me to pick her up, just to hangout with our kids. There were and are times in our now friendship that we go months often years without talking. We always seem to out of nowhere start talking like we never stopped.Back to the story: I answer the phone “Hey, “Lisa” what’s up? Lisa says: not good. She sounds frustrated and sad. What’s going on? I ask My parents and I were arguing about my son’s dad and my son. I just can’t be here right now. Can you please come pick me up and if I can stay with you a few days.Now keep in mind from the beginning on this story. I lived in a 1 bedroom with my son and boyfriend at the time. He offered to leave and go back to his place, which was generous of him. I honestly just didn’t want to deal with the whining and complaining. Another reason why I didn’t want her to stay was the fact that her BD at the time was cheating on her countless times and was really verbally abusive. I had to tell her no based off all the information I know about her and her BD.When I told her I wouldn’t be able to accommodate the three on them. She at first sounded sad and questioned why over the next few days. I told her all my reasons and she said she understood my reasons and appreciated my honesty. I thought we ended on good terms, but that was 12yrs ago.AITA",

	"body" : "For context I 17 (f)( a full time student) live with my mum, sister (22) & her bf (25).1 year ago they moved in,as long as they looked for housing(which they haven’t). My mum also spends a lot of the time at her fiancés as she’s on night shift & my dog wakes everyone up when she comes in and out. My sister used to be a massive clean freak, side note my mum has said HE has until April but SHE can stay for how long she needs, but my sis takes that as her being kicked out also.I’ll do my best to keep it short, my sisters bf (Sam) smokes weed religiously, my mum made it  clear that he was to NOT smoke in the house and go out back. He is jobless and hasn’t paid my mum any form of contribution to him staying here (he’s on UC). Despite that he smokes it in the house & just opens a window. The whole house reeks of it & the course I study I could be kicked off for smelling like weed. That’s only the first issue. Bath water gets left in the bath, he won’t rinse the bath out, he won’t flush the toilet, they won’t clean after themselves, they leave food in the sink, leaves joint ends in the toilet/ sink/ bathroom, they feed my dog stuff he can’t eat,he spends min of 2 hours in the bath, the list can go on & on. Aidan had 3jobs  when him & my sister (Lacy) got together-all 3 good pay. She got a pay raise & magicly he lost all 3. Lacy tries to take all the fall for Aidan because my mum doesn’t like him. Like I said my mums at her fiancé’s & because of this the house becomes a shithole. Now Idk about you but I’m embarrassed if my house is a mess because I don’t live like a pig. Non of it is my mess yet I’m still the only one who ever tidies like always. Last week around Wednesday I didn’t have my study, so I cleaned the kitchen, for TWELVE hours & my kitchen isn’t even that big, that just how dirty it was. I went to my bfs for the weekend, I’ve came home, everything is a tip. Lacy was still at work so I’ve shouted of Sam & asked him why the kitchen was like that, he just gave me a condescending look. So I went on a rant on how he sits on his games all day when he could help clean up, telling him he lives like a pig, he could at least straighten the house, and get some respect for a house that isn’t his, ESPECIALLY since he’s not helping money wise and Lacy & my mum have a full time job & I’m in full time education. It was quite heated but it ended by me telling him to get out my face and to not speak to me. Lacy came home & about an hour later she’s screaming at me for being rude to Sam. I relayed everything I said & told her that she’s changed since living with him bc she would NEVER live like how they’re  making me live now, she called me a c*nt & now she hasn’t spoken to me since Sunday.

	"title" : "AITA for telling my roommate that she is neglecting her puppy",
	"body" : "Apologies for any formatting issues - I’m on my phone.My best friend and I (both 22F) started living together last year. We both work a full-time job (I work 40 hours, and she works between 45-55 hours a week).Roommate wanted a puppy (small female Maltipoo). I said that I was fine with her having a dog, but that I can’t put up with a yappy, untrained dog. She agreed.Things were going okay, but I would notice that the puppy would only get about a 5-10 minute walk in the morning at around 7:30AM, whenever my roommate could get home for lunch (between 11AM-2PM), and then maybe once or twice after she got home (5PM-7PM). Mostly short walks. When she’s gone she leaves a couple toys that the dog gets bored with quickly.The puppy generally played well with my indoor cat (boy), but there were a couple times where she was very hyper because she hadn’t been exercised, and she would grab him by his neck with vigor. This freaked me out, and I told my roommate that the dog should get longer than a 5 minute walk in the morning before work, because if she has a lot of energy she could accidentally hurt my cat.My roommate agreed and told me that she would walk her dog longer in the morning. She didn’t. She was also unwilling to put the dog in daycare, to hire a dogwalker, or to confine her dog in any way unless my cat was also confined some days.Now, the dog is 8 months old and not potty trained, not house trained, barely leash trained, not kennel trained, and not obedience trained (does not listen to any commands besides the occasional “sit”). She pees/poops in the house frequently, peed on the couch twice, barks constantly, and has destroyed some of my belongings. Roommate is not trying to train her, either.The other day, my roommate did not come home at lunch to take her dog out, and so the dog was inside from 7:30AM-5:15PM, and pooped inside. When she can’t take the dog out at lunch, I’ll usually take her out, but she didn’t tell me that she was going to be gone that day.To me, an untrained 8 month old puppy should not be left loose in the apartment for close to 10 hours without a potty break. So when it looked like it was going to happen again the next day, I said that leaving an 8 month old dog inside for 10 hours is getting neglectful. It’s also dangerous for my cat.My roommate was very hurt by this, and said that it is not neglectful. She said that we have different opinions of what neglect is, that her dogs growing up were left inside without a potty break for the whole workday, and that she has to train her dog the way that she sees fit. She is annoyed by how much I complain about the dog. She went to a mutual friend’s house and refused to talk to me.I feel bad for complaining so much and using harsh language, and almost wish I hadn’t said anything.AITA for saying that it’s neglectful behavior?",

Two weeks in she sprung a surgery to remove her bunions on us and said that while she is out she is going to need us to pay the bills while shes out of work and stuff.After I moved she started treating my boyfriend and I horribly. She was being controlling and toxic. There was alot of mental and verbal abuse as time passed and she kept getting worse. She would constantly kick us out over small arguments. (who cleans more, taking jokes too seriously, amazon being charged to the wrong card.)We started looking into our own place because it was just starting to be too much for us. She brought up that she wasn’t going to have the surgery in November like she originally planned, so we kept looking for places. During Christmas, she brought up that she was going to go through with the surgery in February and is going to need our help. This wouldn’t have been a problem if she didn’t say during arguments that “she doesn’t need us” “she could take care of the bills on her own”.In the beginning of January we were given the opportunity to apply for an apartment thats move in ready and in our price range. After approval they can’t hold the apartment for long so we decided that if we get approved then we will be moving. We would have to move by March 1st. The best part about it is its in the same complex so we can still be near them to help out.My boyfriend told her about the opportunity and she went BALLISTIC. Keep in mind we haven’t gotten approved. She was saying things like “If you guys move don’t ever talk to me again” “You guys are just using me” “You're ungrateful”. She even threatened to kick us out that very same night after we told her. She had the nerve to throw and break her phone and call us childish.We don’t want to pass up this opportunity but we don’t know if we should stay or not. She has made it clear numerous times that she doesn’t need us and she can handle everything on her own. She mentioned that her boyfriend would be helping with bills and stuff during this time.

Early on in the relationship we suffered a few blips. He is neurodivergent, this was a new thing to navigate as he hadn’t been in a super serious relationship before. He has seasonal depression, adhd and believes he has high functioning autism. He loves to debate and consequently argue. Last night we were watching a recommended show of his. I had just had a new iphone delivered and was finishing setting it up- organising my new homepage, whilst watching the programme. He doesn’t like when I’m on my phone when we’re watching one of his recommendations. I regularly  avoid doing this. He believes it takes away from the experience of watching movies and that I can’t do both. I somewhat agree, if I were to be scrolling on social media but in this instance I wasn’t. I was setting up my new homepage. He pauses the TV and says ‘are we watching this or what?’. I say ‘yes, I’m just organising my phone screen’. (Not super happy at his tone and abrasiveness though). After the show is done, I say ‘hey, I don’t want to argue but I don’t appreciate the way you spoke to me then’. He starts to tell me that it was ‘rude, distracting him from the show, and that if it was important we could just pause the show. He asks can I not watch something without being on my phone for an hour?’ I say, ‘I don’t want to argue about this, I gave you the opportunity not to be a dick and you’ve just became defensive with me.’ I walk away, not wanting to argue. He attempts to explain that what I was doing is rude, it takes away from what I’m showing him, I wouldn’t do the same in the cinema so why here?, if it’s important we can pause, if it’s not then I should stay off my phone. I tell him that I was enjoying the show, that it was a mindless task of organising my Home Screen and I was still watching it and enjoying it. He disagrees. I tell him that I don’t want to be policed in my own home watching tv after work, sometimes I’ll want to go on my phone. I could maybe understand his frustration if it was an organised date night- where he shows something he loves, we make an evening out of it. But it was just, ‘what do you want to watch?’ And ‘idk, you pick’ kind of situation. I really don’t want to feel like I can’t be on my phone when we watch tv, it makes me feel like I have to give it all my attention, which becomes more of a chore than a nice thing to do together. I do enjoy his recommendations, but I’m not willing to not go on my phone (the little times that I do) just to prevent a blown up argument. Am I being rude and disregarding his feelings?",

There’s a certain supervisor that has always picked on me since I’ve been hired, but luckily we haven’t worked together for the past couple weeks because we’ve had different schedules—until tonight. He recently changed the cleaning process and it now takes twice the amount of time to clean.1st INCIDENT: I asked my supervisor why we’re doing it this way when it takes much longer and he responded by saying, “you’ve done enough already, you can wait outside”. Keep in mind this is after I had cleaned so it wasn’t like I was sitting around refusing to work and complaining. My coworkers agreed that I had asked my supervisor in a respectful tone and was very cordial when inquiring why we were using this new process. He continued to give me attitude and while I was walking away from the plane he yelled, “look at you, first day back and you’re acting like this!”, I kept walking because I didn’t want to escalate the conversation. I also haven’t been on vacation or missed any work so I don’t know what he’s talking about when saying it’s my first day back.2nd INCIDENT: Later that night in our official work groupchat we were asked to vote for an employee of the month. The supervisor that has been problematic votes for a guy named Brad (he is white, this will matter later on)…he then sends a text afterwards saying “The only white boy who works and doesn’t complain”. Clearly referring to me because I’m the only other white male that works in our department.QUESTION: I don’t want to work with him if he’s going to continue picking on me and throwing passive aggressive comments towards me. I don’t have isssues with any of the other coworkers, and they enjoy working with me— so I’ve made sure I’m not the delusional one here. What should I do? Should I try talking to HR?

I texted my landlord at about 5:30 asking for a spare and then got caught up in hosting and drinking at the party. As the party was ending I realized I hadn't heard back from my landlord. So I reached out to the person i'm seeing and asked if I could stay over. I've been with this person on and off for about 3 years. For the sake of this story, i'll call them my partner. They told me they were headed out but suggested I go to a KeyMe kiosk (it stores copies of your keys that print on demand) which was perfect because I had zero intention of screwing with their plans. The problem was I didn't have my wallet, but I convened with them and they really helped me out. We decided that I would get cash from an ATM, to buy a gift card, to use on the KeyMe kiosk and they asked me to update them on my progress.I then spent about the next 3 hours walking across Manhattan. No stores would sell gift cards using google pay, the rest wouldn't sell them after 11pm, and when I finally did get one and made it to a 7/11 that was actually open, turns out the kiosk doesn't accept gift cards. So at this point, about 3am, I am nearly frozen & defeated and get on a train to head to a 24hr McDonalds. I hit my partner and ask if they're headed home, if i can stay over. They agreed and left Manhattan to meet me in Brooklyn where we both live. I stayed over, and next morning they went with me, bought my spare key and lunch the next day. They were amazing and I let them know I was infinitely grateful.Today the situation came up (for context, it was a digression from another conflict we were already having) and they accused me of being selfish that night. They feel like me not checking in with them like we agreed meant I had no regard for what they asked me to do and that was selfish. I explained to them that I did not want to bother them or screw with their plans that night in the first place and since i was confident (at the time) that there was a finish line in view, I figured would just let them know once I had the key.We went back and forth a bit and ultimately. I told them I completely understand their point about adhering to what we agreed on instead of doing something different regardless of my reason, and that I will be cognizant of that moving forward, but I don't agree with the assessment that I was being selfish when my intent was the very opposite. So I wouldn't concede to that label, which was upsetting to them. I argued that the substance of the point that they made was completely understood so whether or not it should be labelled as \"selfish\" is something that we can agree to disagree on. They do not see it this way and that further perpetuated the conflict we were already having. Am I the asshole?",

The residence of the seller was only a 15 min walk from my apartment so she agreed I could meet her there later that afternoon. When I arrived at the door she brought me the chair, she seemed really nice, we made the exchange and I was on my merry way.Like I said, my place was not far so I decided to walk the whole way with the chair upside down with the seat resting atop my head. Upon arrival, I put the chair down in front of my desk and sat in it. Something was off. The wheels wouldn’t move; the chair wouldn’t roll. I turned the chair over and examined it. There were no locks, like some chairs and tables with wheels have. I wiped each wheel down, greased them up but were still all jammed. It was obvious after a good look that not just one but three of the four wheels were busted.I do realize that I’m a fucking ninny nob for not checking the wheels on the damn chair before leaving her house and giving her the money. She was just a nice, little university student, I didn’t expect her to be a double-crosser. Nonetheless, I messaged her right away and was polite about it at first, basically saying that I’m sure it’s an honest mistake and I’ll be happy to come over again right now with the chair and get my money back. She flat out refused and assumed that I had broken the chair somehow on the walk over. Of course I tried to argue my side and explain to her everything in a civil manner, but she proceeded to refuse, saying that she’s moving to a new apartment and she can’t take the chair back, nor return the money.At this point it was no longer about the money, it was about the principle. This is when I took on a more obviously frustrated tone, but without being menacing. I asked her if she knew the chair was broken and accused her of intentionally ripping me off. She only replied with more accusations that I must have been the one to break the chair.The next thing I said was the only mean thing I said throughout the entire conversation, which was, “your parents must be proud of you.” (Not that bad if you ask me). Ok, I might have said, “This is bullshit” once, but for the most part I was being a cordial cupcake.She immediately blocked me and about 20 min later I received a message from one of her friends. They told me not to make any more attempts to contact her and to stop threatening her or else they would call the authorities and give them all my FB information. But where was the threat?

I learn over time that my suitemates don't like sharing much of anything. not their food, trash cans, cooking oil, or even dish soap.about a week after i move in, I'm cooking something in the kitchen. while I'm cooking, my suitemate \"Anna\" approaches me, telling me that it is her stuff. she says, \"can we talk about how much of my stuff you're using?\" to which I reply, yeah, I'm using your pan and spatula. I won't use your food. she says okay and leaves. she later texts me saying that she'd really rather me not use her pans. I tell her it's a bit ridiculous for everybody to have their own pots and pans in a shared kitchen. she tells me she's not budging on this and that I didn't clean her pan properly. I apologize profusely for not cleaning her pan right. I agree I won't use her pots and pans. when I buy my own pot and pan, there's barely room in the cupboard for it, but I squeeze it in.about a week later, Anna texts me telling me not to stack my dishes on the drying mat on top of hers if I don't clean mine properly, because it could gunk up her stuff. by this point, I'm suspicious. I KNOW that I cleaned my dishes properly. I check after she texts me this, and they're just fine -- certainly not messy enough to drop gunk onto her dishes. I text her that I clean my dishes properly.the next day (today) she knocks on my door and shows me one of her bowls. there's a speck of dust on it, and she tells me its proof i dont clean my dishes right. I simply tell her I don't believe her. I know my dishes were spotless, I was extra careful cleaning them. she says she doesn't care what I believe at this point and I should just respect her stuff. I double check my dishes. there's not a spot. and so this is where I believe my behavior may go into asshole territory. I text her, reiterating that my dishes definitely didn't make hers dirty. she responds, reiterating that she doesn't care what I believe, she just wants me to respect her shit.

	"body" : "So a little backstory: I (18) work at my local pub. My Mum(M) and her fiancé(LL) are the landlady/lord and I have been working there since I was 12 after school/ college part time. Since September I have been working 6 days a week full-time to save money while I take a gap year. Now I may be extremely biased here as I had some bad history with both my mum and her fiancé so I’m genuinely wanting outside opinions. Since Christmas I have been doing our staff rota which was previously done by LL as he “doesn’t care, just wants it sorted”.Recently we have had issues with staff attitude especially with our younger staff so LL asked me to change the rota and remove our two waitresses(W1&2) and have just him and me do food service on a Sunday(Sundays are usually our busiest days). He never works FOH and is our chef 5 days a week. He spends most of his time either upstairs gaming(LL and M live above the pub) or in the kitchen and I have honestly never seen him work on the bar for longer than 15 minutes.So this happened last Sunday. We run Sunday roast 12-5. He came into the kitchen while I was double checking an order and announces he is finished because it is quiet. This is at 1:45! I rolled my eyes and he saw. He immediately goes, “Why are you rolling eyes I’m the boss I can do what I want.” I responded, “You said you wanted to do a Sunday service why are you going upstairs halfway through?” He said back, “ I think you forget that you don’t have any power here. I can do what I want so I’m going upstairs you can manage without me.” I’m not going to lie I can and did manage without him but the principle of the matter is what bugs me. So I said back, “You asked me to put you on Sunday and take W1 and W2 off and now you’re not even going to work the shift?” He left the kitchen and as he left he said, “you know I have worked 7 days this week?” (Which really pissed me off as I have been working 7 days a week since September as a half a part time job as well as the pub. I worked 3 shifts with him that week as well and he closed the kitchen early 2 times so was only working for about 2 hours max each day) and went upstairs. I turned to my mum and asked her “am I wrong?” She didn’t respond so I went back out front. The Food bell rung and I went back to kitchen to get some food and my mums’s phone is blowing up. I look at her phone and he is calling me a bitch and asking her why she didn’t stand up for him? Wtf is he 12?!? My mum complained that she was now “getting it in the neck because of me” I told her “it’s because he lazy and it’s not fair on his staff”Annoyingly it was really quiet after he had gone up stairs so I don’t really need him. So where I think I might be an arsehole is shouting at him in front of the kitchen staff and letting my past issues cloud my judgement. AITA?",

My brother was with them that night. He is a person who is hardly affected by these things but he still tried to stop all of it from happening. During Covid my mom was hospitalised so I moved back home after 4 years. My brother was 16 at that time. Series of events starts from here. She was back home a month later I got a pitbull pup. Me my mom and my brother loved him like crazy 6 months later her friends told her that pit bulls are crazy breed and we should get rid of him. My dog was trained on 108 commands by the time he was 6 months old. However he was never fully trained for pooping and peeing outside. He was getting better at it though. My mom thought I wasn’t taking care of him in a good way and her friend’s influence made her give the dog to one those friends who took him to US overnight. I got pissed and moved out of the house the very same day, my brother decided to do the same and came along with me. I was staying by myself for 2 years when I thought my dad’s health is deteriorating and he has been drinking regularly. I got a bigger place and asked him to move with me which triggered my mom. My mom again influenced by her friends filed for divorce after my brother turned 18. She has gone thru a lot of domestic abuse and mental abuse by my father. I was a young kid who took stands a couple of time but eventually thought it’s too toxic and moved to another place. Now I stay with my dad he doesn’t want a divorce cause he says he loves my mother. My mother can’t even look at my father’s face. I know my mother is not a bad person, I know my father hasn’t done good by his wife. I don’t know what kinda f- up situation I’m in.

My other best friend don’t call or text if I don’t reach out first.Long story short yesterday my other  best friend posted that I am getting married and how she was my maid of honor and the other didn’t know, saw it and blew up my phone.

Went on Twitter, snap chat and Facebook talking about how she is done with me and how she just got rid of another fake friend. We have been best friends for 5 years I know she is.

Which will range from 350-450 (her cap is 350, I take care of the rest) I take care of all of our other bills, Rent, Utilities, phone, internet, etc. after all of it we have about 600 bucks left over after gas and other smaller necessities, we only have that much extra because I work 45-50/hrs a week.Just wanted to give very surface level context, but I work 4 on 3 off so I have 3 days where I have been “resetting” the house by cleaning and getting it ready for her every week because she is pregnant and I want it to be easier while I am at work 13,14,15 hours a day and she is home with our first child. But recently I have been really stressing about the amount of room we have for a second child coming and I suggested to her that I will get a second job on my 2 days off and still reserve Sundays for family day, so I can take that money and put it into our savings so we can move before the baby comes, it sparked an argument with her saying “ I don’t want you to burn yourself out, and when are you going to clean, this is very hard on me with the baby and me being pregnant” so I understand where she is coming from, but we need to start planning for the future more than we have been.We came up with these goals together when we found out we were having another child, she then went and talked to her mom about it and her mom says we should stay where we are at because I quote “they won’t remember it anyways” but as a father I will remember that I feel and felt like a failure because I am not able to provide the right life for my children.

I started reading music my sophomore year and started off on bells (glockenspiel). My second year I was promoted to center marimba after auditioning for the spot. I've had that spot since then.When getting my music for this competition season I've accumulated 9 1/2 pages of sheet music. I have the most music out of the entire ensemble, including wind players. Also to add, I started playing 4 mallets my junior year with a small feature of permiantations. Compared to last year I have 3 times the amount of 4 mallet playing. Around 60% of my sheet music requires me to play 4 mallets.Our ensemble includes a section of marching winds, percussion section, and mallet section. Our old mallet/percussion tech left us last year and we now have a new percussion tech. He specializes in drumset and drum related activities (bass, snare, tenors etc.). He can't really read treble clef let alone teach 4 mallets. That's left the mallet line with a strong disadvantage when learning music. We don't have someone to guide us, and my director has left it to me to be responsible for the slack of keeping up with the rest of the ensemble.During rehearsals we are split into \"sectionals\" except that my section doesn't have a director. One mallet player has a learning disability that really sets him behind when learning music, and he is overall around 4-5 years younger than me. I'm not a teacher, I'm a student just like the rest of the mallet line/band.Whenever I try to help said student, they just sit there and watch me try to help them. They never actually try to play the music and \"give up\" but they refuse to quit the ensemble. My efforts to help have frustrated me greatly, I dont understand his disability nor was I notified of it (i figured it out myself).I was also never appointed the position of section leader or any other type of leading psoition.

There were at least 30 people there as she a mix of childhood, college, work, and city friends like me that she's met since moving to nyc. I knew at least 2/3 of the guests and got along well with all of them. There was a $50 spending limit. I spent $51.23 but with our sales tax being almost 10% I went about $5 over the limit. I bought 3 unisex items, 2 of which were on super sale (30-50% off). Without the sale the total would have been around $80. I bought everything at target, it's not like any of the items were extravagant by any means although I got a lot of feedback that my gifts were creative and fun. Some people spent less than $50. For instance someone brought a lush bath set that I saw in store for $30. No issue with that at all just adding for context. I'd say most people spent right around $50.My gift was extremely popular. It was one of the first wrapped packages picked and before we made it through half the picks my gift had already been stolen the max amount of times and removed from rotation. I was super happy the final giftee was excited with the gift. Multiple people asked where I got the gifts and I told them on super sale at target. After the party I left for the holiday then a long vacation with my husband. I returned recently and heard through the grapevine a couple people were annoyed with my gift. Apparently they feel the $50 cap applies to the value of the gift not the sticker price and feel that i intentionally tried to upstage them. Hand to God I didn't, I thought if I spent $50 I was within the rules. For what its worth the 2 ladies annoyed with me are people I did not know prior to that night, and after apologizing to the hostess she reassured me i did nothing wrong and she loved what i brought. No one I know was upset with my gift either. But now I am questioning myself if I was an asshole for buying gifts that were worth more than $50?

	"body" : "So my boss convinced me to download FanDuel and  they said they were gonna send me the money to bet on it and then I could keep a portion of it and they would keep the rest. I was confused as to why they couldn’t just do it on theirs but I’m a people pleaser and can’t say no and didn’t know much about it but said okay I guess. So I downloaded it and they sent me $5 to put on it. I signed up and learned that there was a sign on bonus and I said oh wow maybe I’ll make a bet later too using that. Later on they said hey send me your login so I can make a bet since you don’t really know how it works I said okay. Come to find out later they used my $150 sign on bonus for the bet and I didn’t know nor did they tell me they were going to. I didn’t even know it was that much. So anyways that bet won $776 on my acc. They told me to send them all the money and I can keep $50. Upon realizing they used my $150 sign on AND that I’m going to now have to pay taxes AND they took advantage of me, I said we could split it. They said no and that they deserve the most. I sent $400 to be done with it. They keep texting me saying they deserve that money and it’s not fair and they lost money now and they were gonna use it all on a trip and it’s not fair.",

	"body" : "I 21f, am in college and I live on campus in an apartment. At the beginning of the semester, there were four of us, however one of them moved at shortly after the semester started. Fast forward to the start of this semester and we had a new roommate just show up. I, nor my other two roommates, were made aware of a fourth person moving in. She just showed up.She’s been here for 5 days so far and she’s at the top of my list for worst roommates. She started off with wearing her shoes through the apartment (we’re in the Midwest & it’s covered in snow right now) so she’s tracking in snow and salt all over the apartment and embedding dirt and salt into the carpet. She also keeps shutting the bathroom door after she showers and not leaving the fan on, and our bathroom has already been treated for mold this year (campus housing is fantastic). We have asked her to leave the bathroom door open already. She’s been very loud coming in and out of the apartment at all hours and I have been woken up from her being loud in the middle of the night. The last straw, however, was that I woke up for work Saturday morning to find that there was literal feces on my hand towel in the bathroom from her. I know it was her because she was the only one in the bathroom after I was the previous night. Disgusted, I did not have time to address it before I left for work. When I came home from work, I found that another feces stain was now on the paper towel roll in the kitchen.I made my 2 other roommates aware of this and they agreed that it was disgusting and that we needed to sit her down and discuss with her. Tonight, I got back from classes, only to find that there’s trash on the floor, literally 4 steps away from the trash can. She couldn’t bother to take the extra 4 steps to throw the trash in the correct spot. I’m at my wits end. I made a list of everything that has happened and previous agreements for apartment rules that we had agreed upon prior to her arrival. When presented to her, she stated that I, specifically, am being standoffish towards her and that she does not appreciate it.AITA for addressing these issues and trying to remedy the situation?",
