	"body" : "We have been planning on going on vacation to cuba for the Christmas holidays for a week. It’s pretty pricey during the Christmas holidays but that’s the only time we can all go. We have three children 20F, 15M, and 12F who we are making them pay for their own ticket and part of the hotel since we wouldn’t be financially stable enough to pay for 5 plane tickets and such.My 12 year old daughter has been complaining that since the other two have jobs and she doesn’t that it’s not fair. However we’ve decided to stick firm with it and be equal to them all. Their other option if they don’t want to pay is staying at grandmas. She has savings which are just enough to cover the vacation but she also wants to save up for a phone. My other two children aren’t happy that they have to pay for their own but they are willing to since we’d be going to cuba.AITA for making them pay? I feel like most families don’t make their children pay for their own tickets but since we all really want to go my wife and I think it’s the best option.Edit: my 12 year old daughter (almost 13)  is going to grade eight and she has worked at our business a couple times for me which i would pay her.",

	"title" : "AITA for wearing a different colored bridesmaid dress after the bride tried to purposely make us look unflattering?",
	"body" : "Hi, for privacy reasons this post will be a throwaway, and all names are fake.Recently, I (28F) was a bridesmaid in my friend Tara (28F) and Tony's (30M) wedding, along with bridesmaids Amy (27F), Jane (29F) and her sister Lily (32F).Tara was one of those brides where everything had to be perfect, so early on, Tara placed her priority on the logistics. Because of this, Tara had left the details about the bridesmaid dresses for last.Tara had organized a lunch for us in April to talk over the details of the dresses. She handed out swatches and said that the dresses must be in that color and floor length. I asked Tara if she was being serious to which Tara asked what the problem was. Simply put, the color was ugly and unflattering. Jane also spoke up and said that this color is going to make everyone in the party look bad. Amy also agreed. Tara rolled her eyes at us and said that she was sure and she expected us as bridesmaids to go along with what she wanted. Lily decided to chime and say that she thought the color was fine. I think that she said this to prevent her younger sister from going full bridezilla.For months, Amy, Jane and I BEGGED Tara to consider a different color, but she wouldn't budge. We asked Lily to ask her sister to reconsider, but she said that she was the bride, and that we should \"respect her choices.\" Yeah, no shit she was the bride, but that doesn't mean that we have to sacrifice the way we look, and look unattractive. Amy pointed out that Tara was probably making us look bad on purpose, so that she could look better, and that made me furious.And here's where I may be in the wrong. Amy, Jane and I decided that enough was enough and that Tara was being really unreasonable about this whole thing, and so was Lily. So we decided to lie to Tara and say that we were going to order dresses in the color she wanted and sent her screenshots of dresses in that color. Meanwhile, the three of us created a separate group chat and decided to order dresses that would actually make us look good. We agreed on baby blue and bought the dresses online. Tara didn't ask any more questions about the dresses and essentially just took our word that everything was okay.Flash forward to wedding day. The moment we put on our dresses, Tara lost her shit. She started yelling at us and crying, and Lily had to escort her out of the room. Apparently she must have gotten ready elsewhere, because we didn't see her up until we were called to go to the venue for the ceremony. The wedding was great, but Tara was upset.Since the wedding, none of us have heard from Tara. However, Lily and Tony have been texting me, calling us horrible people and claiming we ruined the wedding. Tony even said that Tara almost cancelled the whole thing, and he had to force her to go through with it. Maybe Tara was upset that we didn't get the color that she asked for, but I don't think it was right for her to make us look unattractive. AITA?",

For context, I would always make these dumb but funny jokes about babysitting Sophia considering I’m older than she is and I’ve been working there longer than her and she is barely an adult but I still made those jokes about her when she was still 17. Honestly though, Sophia is still pretty much a baby.But anyways around Sophia’s last few days working here I made a joke which left her embarrassed. I was making a salad and then she came over to make one as well and she made a joke saying that it smelled like eggs and she asked if it was me. I told her that it was probably because her body smells like a fish.She didn’t say much and later I continued to say “can anyone smell something fishy” in front of the other coworkers and everyone laughed but Sophia moved her hair in my face and I said that she had lice and everyone once again laughed. Sophia was very upset and didn’t speak to me for the rest of the shift and I tried talking to her but she wouldn’t even look at me. At one point one of the prep cooks asked me why I treated her like that and even said that I traumatized her. The problem is that Sophia got bullied when she was in high school for these exact reasons and I only brought back all her trauma by what I said. I didn’t know though.Towards the end of our shifts, I was closing and I thought it’d be funny to mess with Sophia by asking her if I have to babysit her again. She got really angry and told me to shut the fuck up and leave her alone. I went and told the shift lead and she went and had a word with Sophia about how she needs to keep things professional and our manager also had a word with her and she got written up for talking like this.Once we were let out she ran to her car in tears and drove home. The next day she filed a complaint to HR and even told another manager and I got talked to. Throughout the shift she wouldn’t speak to me. I asked if she can hand something to me, she wouldn’t do it. Towards the end of the shift, I was one of the closers and I was in charge of checking tables she asked the other server that was closing with me to check them and she told her to get over herself already and to ask me.In the end she went and got the manager to check them because she wasn’t going to speak to me. I was only trying to make a joke. Recently, Sophia got fired and I haven’t heard anything since. So I’d like to know AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for rehoming my cat?",
	"body" : "Hello everyone.So when I was 9, my parents rescued a 5 year old cat from our local animal shelter. I agreed to getting the cat, since I was 9 at the time, and of course I wasn't going to turn down the opportunity to get a fluffy animal. However, I'd be lying if I said I loved the cat growing up. I didn't hate the cat by any means, but I came to realise that I'm definitely more of a dog person. However, we never owned any animals apart from the cat, since my dad has a fear of dogs for some reason.Last year, I moved in with my boyfriend, and I took the cat with me, since my parents thought that the cat had bonded to me more. I was fine with this, since the cat does it's own thing. However, problems began to arose when me and my boyfriend got a French Bulldog puppy, since neither of us had been able to get a dog up until now. The Frenchie was very gentle towards our cat, and doesn't bother her. The cat, on the other hand, made her distain for him VERY apparent. This was done through hissing, loudly shrieking etc. This went on for a year, with the cat's behaviour towards our dog gradually getting worse. I live 2 hours away from my parents, so taking the cat back to them wasn't really a viable option. After making all the efforts I could to get my cat to get along with my dog, albeit, to no avail. I decided to take my cat to the local animal shelter, since cat's tend to be easily adoptable when compared to dogs.My parents recently came to visit. While they were here, they asked me where the cat was, to which I told them that I'd taken it to the local animal shelter. A huge argument ensued, despite the fact that I'd reassured them that the cat had been adopted, since it was no longer on the shelter's website. My parents left shortly after, and we haven't spoken since. My boyfriend has sided with me on this, saying that had we taken our Frenchie to the shelter, there's a good chance it may have been euthanized due to the over abundance of dogs in shelters.AITA here?",

	"title" : "AITA for reporting a delivery driver who I thought was lying to get out of doing more work?",
	"body" : "Throwaway account because I don’t want this linked to my main.So today for lunch I decided to order from a Mexican restaurant through one of those food delivery services. I’ve had a bad experience or two where my order was missing some items, but the drivers would always be gone before I realized and could catch them to fix the issue. I’d always have to report it through the app’s support chat, which is such a pain to use because they obviously outsource their representatives and it’s frustrating trying to communicate with them. I usually give up after a few messages back and forth.When my driver arrived, I told her to stay so that I could check the bag and make sure everything was there. I noticed she kind of raised her eyebrow for a moment but otherwise she stood quietly and waited. Sure enough, a couple things were missing. I politely said she needed to return to the restaurant and get my missing items.In a very neutral, rehearsed-sounding tone, she said that it’s “against company policy to do that and I should contact support through the app.” I explained that I preferred not to deal with support. She said they’re the only ones who can help and she’s really not supposed to go back to the restaurant.I was a bit annoyed at this point so I asked what the company policy was on making sure orders were correct. She said that restaurants close the bags for the drivers and they’re not meant to open them or the containers inside. Something about food safety violations and not being trained (?). After a moment she apologized for the trouble and left.To me this honestly just sounds like a bunch of BS excuses to get out of doing her whole job. If they “can’t go back to the restaurant,” how are customers supposed to get their food/money back? If they “can’t open bags to check the orders” how do they even know they’re delivering the right food? It makes no sense to me.So on the page where I rate my driver and can leave feedback, I made a note of my situation and explained why I thought she was in the wrong. I then left one star and revoked my tip. A bit later I was talking to my sister over the phone, who I thought would enjoy the story because she works for a different-but-similar delivery company. My sister said “did you ACTUALLY think she was gonna go back to the restaurant?” I laughed, thinking she was taking a dig at a competing company’s drivers, but she just said “I’m not joking, you literally reported her for following the rules.”At first I thought my sister had misunderstood a part of the story or something so I kind of brushed it off, but now based on her reaction and what both her and the driver said, I’m wondering if they’re right?

	"body" : "My 18 year old daughter graduated a week ago, she pays rent, splits the bills with me, and pays for her own phone bill. She’s a very independent young girl.As a 56 year old woman, I’m at an age where I don’t have a menstrual cycle anymore and so I don’t buy products for that purpose anymore, and so it turned out to happen when she turned 18 so it was as if it were perfect timing to stop buying them, but even if she were under 18 and I didn’t have this anymore I would stop buying them as well. Since she’s 18 I feel better about not having to go out and buy them since she’s at that age where she’s graduated and independent.My boyfriend somehow found out that she’s been using napkins she bought at the grocery store, he said that he asked her why she bought 2 packs of napkins and she explained that she needs them for personal use and assumed it was for that. I didn’t believe him at first until I asked her about it and she explained to me that she makes homemade “tampons” by rolling the napkins, and she does it to save money. I have money myself so I could go out and buy them for her but she would need to pay me back.He asked me what I thought when I finished talking to her alone and I said that he was right and explained that she does it to save money, and he was furious and said that I should be providing those for her. I told him that I no longer buy them because I no longer use them, because when I did I would share but now, especially because she’s 18 she can buy her own. I know she’s my daughter but the support has to stop sometime. The reason my boyfriend was furious was because she got her thing and found out there were no products left so she had to use napkins and now she only uses those. This is her own issue to deal with, and she has no problem being self-sufficient. She’s been 18 for several months.",

	"body" : "I (27M) have an older sister (34F). She is a professional chef, and she has a lot of culinary-themed tattoos. Recently she got her hands tattooed with measurements she uses a lot in the kitchen, like teaspoon and tablespoon and that sort of thing. She says she actually refers to them at work a lot, but I really think she just got them because it makes people ask her what they're about and then she gets to talk about being a chef. It impresses people and I know she enjoys the attention.Recently, we were having dinner with our parents and some family friends. The conversation turned to tattoos, and of course my sister started talking about her new ones. Since they're food-related, that steered the conversation away from tattoos and onto cooking and recipes. I kept waiting for the conversation to go back to tattoos so that I could talk about my newest one, but it wasn't happening. Finally, I found an opportunity to point out the fact that one of my sister's tattoos is such poor quality it dyed a part of the skin around it blue. That happens if the artist presses too hard and it's permanent, which means it was a cheap tattoo.Everyone else looked really awkward, but my sister laughed for some reason and said something like \"yeah, I just have a blue hand now, oh well\", and that really bothered me. I have many tattoos myself, but all of mine are really meaningful and I take a lot of care to find good artists. She obviously doesn't take them seriously and just gets them on a whim, but since hers are mostly for attention, everyone wants to talk about hers instead.I told her she shouldn't be so casual about having a bad tattoo and that it looks like it was cheap. I told her I'm glad she likes it but it looks like she's been taking colloidal silver or something. My dad told me to let it go and my mom kept trying to change the subject, and finally my sister just said \"my tattoos are personal, it's okay if you don't like them\" and ignored me for the rest of the night. My mom thinks I should apologize and apparently the friends who were there thought I was out of line. Personally, I think I was just pointing out a fact, and I honestly want her to get better tattoos in the future for her own sake. AITA?",

My daughter's mom and I were never in a relationship when she got pregnant with my daughter. My daughter has always lived with her mom, she visits us 1-2 times a month on the weekends.For years ever since my wife and I got together we always do 2 trips a year for each of our birthdays. When our kids were born, we skipped the trips for a few years and then as they got older we left them with her parents for our little 4 day trips. Now that the boys are older, we took them to the Grand Canyon for my wife's birthday a few months ago. We were surprised at how good the boys are at traveling (quiet on airplanes, they don't mind walking for a few hours, just generally in a very good mood) so we thought we'd do something bigger for my birthday - a trip to Disneyland. This is especially special because I haven't been there either (I grew up poor and Disneyland was just too expensive). We flew out last week (before the Thanksgiving rush) and enjoyed 5 days in SoCal/Disney. It was a fun, fun experience.When we got back, my daughter (who has already been to Disneyland with her mom) visited and found out about the trip from my sons. I wasn't hiding the trip from her at all I just didn't think it was a big deal because she's already been there before. My daughter was very upset and said it was unfair that she wasn't invited or included on the trip.I told her that it was a family trip for us and that her mom wouldn't have covered her half of the ticket anyways. Her mom is not in poverty or anything, she's just a teacher without much cash to spare. I legitimately tried to reason with my daughter. If her half of the ticket was covered, she could've joined us. I've never had my daughter yell at me much less as much as she did that day. I don't understand the issue when 1 - she's already been to Disney 2 - her mom couldn't have afforded that extra expense 3 - my sons weren't jealous of her when she went a few years ago. I just don't get the issue. I told her that we enjoyed the trip so much that we're going back in March when the weather is warmer and that we'll let her mom know now so she can start saving for the ticket.

When I got there, I noticed she was asleep on the couch and her laptop was on the coffee table. She hates sleep mode so she disabled it so her laptop was on, not even locked. She had a word document and it seemed she’s been working on it.I caught some words and couldn’t help myself, I started reading. I took the laptop to the kitchen to not wake her up. Turns out it was romantic fan fiction about one of her favourite tv series. Nothing steamy, just some silly, girly, romantic notions kind of bs. You know the ones teenage girls dream of and then realise no man actually behaves like that. It’s like “no Susan, I ain’t touching the small of your back because you’re cute, not catching those harassment allegations” if you know what I mean.I was curious and desired to spy a little bit to see if she’d written more and discovered her accounts on 2 platforms for fan fiction (had no idea those sites were that huge). Anyway, she’s written a lot of them. All cutesy, girly shit and some naughty stuff (again, unrealistic in my opinion).When she woke up in the morning, I confronted her about this and she was defensive and started going on about privacy and stuff. I told her to cut the crap and to admit that she feels dissatisfied about our relationship and that’s why she’s writing and I gave her a reality check and said her “soft” men she writes were unrealistic. She was really angry and kicked me out. I told her I’m not one of her characters and won’t tolerate her mood swings but she still kicked me out.Later that day we were meeting our friends for lunch. Sandra came but barely spoke to me. At some point, we were talking about something and I mentioned what Sandra writes, hoping that people will laugh and one guy did, the rest just ignored my news which kind of surprised me, I tried to continue the topic and understand why everyone’s seemed okay with the cringe but Sandra called me an asshole and went to the bathroom. My friend told me it would be best if I left but I didn’t want to do so because  didn’t do anything bad. When Sandra came back she told me her writing is her private thing and I’m an asshole for bringing it up. I told her to grow up and call me when she comes to her senses but she’s hasn’t called me since.I told my other friends and they agreed with me that what Sandra writes is cringe and should have been called out and they don’t think I am the asshole so I’m still confused about my other friends’ reaction.

	"body" : "I 46 M have been married to my wife Amanda 41 F for 6 years. When Amanda and I met She had two children from a previous relationship Chloe 17F and Marcus 15 M. Despite their father being absent, the children have never viewed me as a parental figure which does not bother me as although I love their mother, I don't see them as my children or feel any love for them. They're good kids, just not mine.Earlier this year Chloe expressed her desire to move out at the end of the year. I did not think she could realistically afford to move out. Her mother and I both work long hours, so Chloe leaving would mean I would most likely have to hire help or cut down my working hours as she does a lot to help out at home so her leaving would not be ideal. I handle all household expenses so In order to deter her from leaving I suggested she try paying a portion of the bills/home expenses to get an idea of what living alone will be like. Her and her mother both agreed this would be a wonderful idea and so we drew up an agreement that she would pay ¼  of the bills and household expenses and her mother and I would stop financially supporting her.I thought this would be enough for her to change her mind however she was able to afford this comfortably. I decided to lie to her and tell her that due to inflation our bills and expenses had risen greatly and she would owe me an extra $150 a month. My hope was that even if she could still afford to pay me she would not be able to simultaneously save enough money to move out.Recently her brother Marcus was doing a school project that required him to analyse our families electricity, gas, water etc usage. I foolishly allowed him access to my study to look over our past bills. At some stage he asked his sister to assist him in his work. When she was looking over the bills it came to her attention that I had been overcharging her for sometime. She worked out roughly how much money I overcharged her and went to her mother with this number. They are now calling me an asshole for stealing her hard earned money and are demanding I return the money. I don't think its fair to call it hard earned when most of it is inheritance from her fathers passing. I had her best interest in mind and think i was just teaching her how the world works, so AITA?EDIT: thank you everyone for your helpful suggestions, i will be putting the sum she estimated I overcharged her into an account and will tell her i was saving it as a surprise. Hopefully she doesn't come across this post.A response to some common themes in the comments, i would like to make it clear i have never cleaned my home and will not be starting now. I do not like the noise of the vacuum or the smell of cleaning products. Maybe i went to far by saying i have no love for my step children. I want to make it clear that i like them they just annoy me as they're not my blood.EDIT 2: you all need to get a lifeEDIT 3: I aged down everyone for privacy reasons which was my mistake. Many people are concerned Chloe is a minor I would like to make it clear she is in fact older however still do not wish to reveal her age for anonymity’s sake",

	"title" : "AITA for Skipping my Biological Daughters Graduation to Attend my Potential Step Kids Instead",
	"body" : "I (41M) have an ex which I have 3 children with, one of which recently had her high school graduation. My daughter Angie(17F, late birthday) invited me to her graduation, and I’d said I’d be there. I am currently in a committed relationship to my girlfriend of a few months (41F), who has a daughter Lauren (24F). Lauren recently graduated with a bachelors in biology.A week before the graduations, I was then given an invite by my girlfriend and Lauren to her graduation. Her father passed away and she told me it would mean the world to have someone there to support her in his place. I agreed before learning what the date and time of the event was.Day of the graduation, I’m getting ready to head over to Angie and her mothers house to head off to the ceremony. My girlfriend asks me why I’m getting ready to early, so I explain its in two hours, got an hours drive and want to make sure I’m there on time so I don’t hold them up, as well as travel time to the venue - then she cuts me off to say that she had no idea that was today, and told me today was also Laurens graduation. Laurens ceremony was 3 hours after the start time of Angie's graduation. I did some math and figured I had time to at least be partially present for Angie’s graduation, give her the gift I had for her, and take some pictures beforehand, but my girlfriend was not too happy with the idea. Stating it would be devastating if I didn’t keep my promise to Lauren, and that I wouldn’t be “stepfather material” if I blew her off like that. I tried to explain I'd still be there for the entirety of Laurens ceremony with this plan but she just wouldn't listen, but wouldn't give me any reason why either besides just me \"owing it to her\" and her daughter.I let that get the best of me and gave Angie a call, told her I was having issues with my car and wouldn’t be able to attend, however I would see her as soon as I could to get the gifts and take her out to dinner to celebrate with me. I went to Lauren's ceremony later in the day. Of course I was in some of the pictures, which were posted on Facebook and I was tagged in them. My wife, and probably Angie too, saw the photos on my page.My ex wife is livid, saying I betrayed my daughter and blew her off for some other kid I barely know or have any responsibility for. I tried to play it off like we took Laurens car there but she didn’t listen. She said I could have done better, could’ve done more, with stuff like uber and lyft I could’ve gotten a ride if I cared enough to see her and pay the fees but I just decided not to and I don’t deserve to be in her life anymore. Angie isn’t responding to my calls to set up our agreed upon dinner date to celebrate her achievement. AITA, or are they just blowing things out of proportion ? I can understand how not even bothering to attend partially would make me TA, but I figured planning a day just for her separately would make up for that, am I wrong?Edit : me and Angie were never close. She's what I considered my \"different/boring\" child. Always on her phone around me, we never shared any interests, its not like we were buddy buddy. Angie always had social problems. I am quite close to Lauren. Shes very funny and outgoing, enjoys engaging in conversation/debate with me. - Added since someone said I barely knew Lauren.",

	"body" : "Last week has been quite a disaster for my co-worker (30F). You can call her Aly, Ali, Allie, etc. but anyway I remember her being confident and content the day we went into work. Her brother Rhett (26M) would end up falling off a roof of his house hours later. From what I’ve heard, he was conscious at the time of the hit and believed he was okay and that he felt fine so he didn’t call emergency services. Turns out he was really messed up internally and died and when I found out Ally’s brother died, I was in shock and saddened by her loss. I couldn’t imagine losing a sibling. However when I heard more information, I couldn’t help but think he was reckless. What was he doing on the roof? Why didn’t he just call for emergency services just in case? If that was me, I would have definitely have done that, especially knowing something like this could put my family throw grief and sorrow if it ended fatally. It was unfortunate that they had to lose him, but when I think of tragedy, he’s just not what I think of. Careless and reckless deaths don’t belong in the same context of “tragedy” as other types of deaths. Now, I would never ever say this to Aly but I’ve considered venting this to other friends or co-workers but I just don’t know if they would see my point or not. Many of the co-workers especially seem like the type who would disagree with my stance but it only makes me feel it stronger in a sense. A reason why this would come off as asshole-type behavior is that Rhett was a minimum wage worker from lower-class income and he may have just decided to let it go because he was afraid of being in steep medical debt if he went to the hospital. I do see the point of how class would have an effect on his death but I don’t know if that was really his reasoning. I don’t know him well and I’m not a minimum wage worker. Would just simply venting to someone I knew who knew Aly or Rhett (other than Aly) be out of line or is it okay?",

I remember really enjoying my childhood time with Amelia, who was old enough to babysit me by the time I could form memories. I know that Ada's a responsible girl and has recently been taking babysitting training at her school, so I asked early on into the holidays if she would like to watch Delia. She confirmed that she would and has been doing a wonderful job.Ada's taken more and more responsibility over the cousins, and now handles their breakfasts, lunches, snacks, and entertainment and does a good job with the babies' naps and bottles. It's been wonderful for us.For the first time the other day myself, my sisters, and our respective husbands decided to go for a nice hike and just left Ada and the children alone with my parents. While we were out, Caleb and Benjamin had gotten into the pantry, eaten a ton of candy, got really hyper and were annoying Bella, Brooke, and Alice. Ada responded by locking Caleb and Benjamin into the bedroom her and Alice are staying in as a time-out. Ada was then distracted with the babies. In the mean time, Caleb had started crying because his stomach hurt and ended up vomiting because of all the candy, all over this blanket Ada's had since she was little and is very attached to. She takes good care of it and was distressed to see how messy it had gotten.My parents were shouting at the kids to calm down, which also was not helping the situation. Cynthia and Beth were upset with Ada leaving Caleb and Benjamin alone for some unspecified amount of time in a locked room to vomit. I was annoyed at Ada for messing up the childcare on the one day none of the parents were there--she has had days of supervised practice, effectively, and chose to mess up the day we had all went on a hike? Ada was crying because she was really upset over her blanket but also embarrassed to be so attached to a blanket.I told Ada that I was disappointed in her. I told her that she ought to know better from her trainings and, if she wants to make money off of it, she's going to have to manage multiple kids. Ada then started crying again and Amelia told me that I was being an annoying younger sister and I would never understand how hard it is to be the eldest. I don't know what that has to do with anything--if Ada didn't think she could handle the children, she should have spoken up at the beginning. We had all trusted her and she had disappointed.

	"body" : "My husband, Matt (52M) and I (46F) have three children; a son Andrew, 24, and two daughters, ages 12 and 8. When Andrew was growing up, I felt a bit trapped in the role of a stay-at-home mom. Matt was (and still is) a great father and earned more than enough to afford all the necessities and some luxuries too (we had just purchased a new Infiniti which Matt had picked out) but I wasn't happy and was seriously considering asking for a divorce.One day I was involved in a minor fender bender while out shopping. I was driving our still fairly-new car and Andrew was with me. None of us were hurt but neither of the doors on the passenger's side of the car could be opened. Andrew was understandably upset, (and so was Matt). The guy who hit me, Raul, was actually very nice. We exchanged contact info, and honestly I really enjoyed talking to him. So I began seeing him whenever Matt and Andrew weren't home. Honestly I was happier than I had been in a long time, but I eventually felt guilty. I told Raul that I wanted to work on my marriage. So we broke up.I confessed everything to Matt, and he agreed to go to counseling. Around this time, I found out I was pregnant with a baby boy. We did a prenatal DNA test and it showed that Matt was not the father. I decided to give my son up for adoption after he was born, so that's what we did. Matt and I then had our two daughters. I've always felt guilty about the adoption, so a few years ago I did a DNA test and found my son, Diego. I was horrified to learn that grew up in foster care and had an unhappy childhood. He always wanted to know his biological parents. He found Raul and has a good relationship with him. I told Diego that I wish things had been different.Matt's parents, who passed away in 2021 and 2022, left half of their estate to Andrew, and the other half was to be divided between our two daughters. TBH I thought this was unfair, but it's the way they wanted to do it. The girls will receive their portion of the estate when they turn 18. I have yet to begin distributing the money to Andrew, and the reason why is that I feel strongly that half of his portion should go to Diego.I have told Andrew that I would like give half of his portion to Diego because it’s the least we can do to make up for the fact that I should never have given him up. He’s my son, and the only reason why I gave him up is because I thought it’s what I needed to do to save my marriage, but he’s had a really hard life as a result. Matt has taken Andrew’s side saying that not only is this this unfair, but it’s against what his parents wrote in their wills. I know that there’s the legal aspect, but there’s also the moral aspect of me wanting to make up for a mistake I made when I was in a bad place. Matt is now threatening divorce, while Andrew has saying some really horrible things about both me and Diego to pretty much anyone who will listen.Is what I’m asking such an unreasonable request?",

However, things have taken a challenging turn for the worse since I moved my new wife and her 13-year-old Daughter into our home.My daughter has been quite vocal about her dissatisfaction with my wife's efforts to be a mother figure and the way she tries to assert authority over her. She feels uncomfortable with my wife's attempts to take on a motherly role.

I will just address a lot of the things here including what happened after my first post.Update:I talked to her over the weekend. She didn't have time to sell her car before leaving so she contacted me saying she did some paperwork to transfer the car to me.I do understand that she felt hurt, so I told her that I would buy a plane ticket to go see her. She had never once went back to her home country after moving away, so I've never visited her home country. I wanted to show that I am very serious about her and that I am still committed, so I wanted to fly over to visit and talk things out.She immediately turned me down - saying that flight tickets are expensive and that I still have work. I begged her to let me, and she eventually said that she couldn't forget the stuff that happened, and that she couldn't come back from it. I explained my side again and that while I understand that she is hurt, I shouldn't be forced to take responsibility for her, and that I hoped she would be understanding of that.The conversation was long. She said she could never trust me again. She said I never saw a future with her from the start, and that I abandoned her. She said it wasn't just about the sponsorship, but it played a big part in it.In the end, she told me that she still loved me, but she doesn't think we should be together.To clarify a couple of things:Why I didn't want to go through with sponsoring her: I would have to be financially responsible for her for 3 years. If she gets any government assistance or social welfare, I would have to pay it back. I also can’t sponsor anyone else until the 3 years have passed.Even though I listed that I missed her cooking first, it doesn't mean that that that was the first thing I missed about her. I was just listing it out without thinking about a particular order, and yes I did miss HER terribly.To those who commented and messaged me saying that I am an immigrant: I don't know what that has to do with anything. My parents moved to where I am now so yeah.Yes, no one I know has to do anything like this. No one I know has to make the decision of whether or not to sponsor a visa. I don't think it's fair for anyone to have to take on this much responsibility, and saying that they should feels like gaslighting. Relationships shouldn't be this hard, and having to do something like that doesn't feel normal. For those of you who called me an asshole, how many of you actually have to make a decision like I did?

Angela is bisexual, and while I'm genuinely not bothered by it or anything, I do like to make a joke out of her sexuality every now and then. It's never malicious, and she usually just laughs along. However, this past summer, I went on a tour of a US Navy base with Angela, our 5-year old adopted daughter, and Angie's 29-year-old sister. We went down to a submarine, and our daughter was freaking out about how cool it was, and we all had a good time. However, while we were using the ladder to get out of the sub, Angie's sister went up right before Angie. And her sister was wearing a skirt that day (with running shorts underneath, however), and my wife looked up and got a view up her own sister's skirt while we were making our way up the ladder. After we got out of the sub, I jokingly asked my wife \"did you enjoy the view?\" My wife took a second to process the joke, and then she said \"excuse me? What's that supposed to mean?\" She forced me to explain the joke right there, right in front of our daughter, which I didn't really appreciate.The aftermath of it is that after our Navy tour, Angela spent a few days at her parents' house because she was so upset about my joke. We did later reconcile, and although we're all living under one roof now, there is a bit of an uneasy atmosphere these days. In any case, I've stopped making jokes about my wife's bisexuality.Edited: to add that my wife naturally has a sense of humor about her sexuality, and she subscribes to subs like r/bi_irl and doesn't mind self-deprecating jokes.Also edited to add that I made that joke in front of my daughter, because she wouldn't have understood it. That's why I didn't have a problem with making the joke in front of her, but I did resent having to explain it in front of her.Last edit I'll make: While my wife was upset about the joke I made, I was also upset at her for not being graceful and making a big deal out of it.

I explained that he had to be the better man, especially since Ben hasn't really done anything except from making fun of him, teasing him, and sending girls letters as people in that age-group do.He got upset and asked Sarah (his twin sister) to back him up, and she was on his side. I didn't back down, however, and made him accept that Benjamin would be coming.The party went just fine, Ben brought gifts, etc. Aaron wasn't happy he was there, but he managed to hold in his disappointment until everyone left. And then he began to yell at me, saying that he hates me and that he'd never talk to me.I just didn't want to allow my son to throw a tantrum like that, again, Ben hasn't really done anything bad or bullied him in other ways.AITA?",

In the beginning, he couldn't eat, he couldn't sleep, he barely ever talked to anybody and his grades started to drop a bit. His grandfather was basically like his dad (his dad walked out on him when he was 10) and those two were inseparable. I felt so bad seeing him like this, knowing there was nothing I could do.As of now, he is doing a lot better. But whenever there are any reminders of his grandfather, he breaks down all over again. And when he does, he's all depressed for about a week before he starts to recover all over again.Now comes that damn hat.His grandfather wore that baseball hat all the time. During his last few breaths, he gave that hat to Josh. Now that hat is his prized possession. Whenever he sees it, again, he breaks down.I've tried and tried to stop getting him to look at that thing but he just keeps doing it and reminding himself. Whenever he does, all the work we put into getting him to cheer up again just goes down the drain.I was just sick of that hat so one day when he was showering, I snuck it into my bag. When I left, I threw it into the garbage.He called me 2 days later in a complete panic, asking if I've seen it. I thought about lying but decided to fess up. He completely broke down harder than he ever has recently, asking how I could do something so awful and claiming that I 'ruined his life'. I started crying too, trying to explain that it was for his own good but he eventually hung up on me.I was just trying to make this grieving process easier for him because I hated seeing him like that.

My neighbor has 2 daughters with a husband whose a lawyer and she's a nurse so her kids are spoiled rotten. When I caught wind of her taking his kids school shopping I asked if I could have a lift to the local walmart since I didnt want to waste money with having to take myself and the kids on the bus and she said sure. We were dropped off at walmart and I told my kids they could get 1 special school item so my 2 daughters got sparkly mechanical pencils and my 1 son got a dinosaur notebook and my other son got colorful gel pens. There was frozen pizzas on sale and since we cant afford to order pizza and only have frozen pizzas on occasion I said why not and bought one for dinner and then I got them some new school clothesWhen neighbor picked us up a few hours later her backseat and trunk were FILLED with garbage from Justice, Abercrombie, Staples etc plus they had To Go bozes.

	"title" : "AITA for being upset over my brother's relationship?",
	"body" : "So I (22M) have a brother (24M) who's been seeing this girl for around six or seven months now. If it's relevant, my brother works 40 hour weeks, Monday to Friday, and works overtime quite frequently. He's a workaholic, if you will. On the other hand I'm unemployed and have been for a year now, I have my degree and diploma but am still job searching.My brother and I were born 19 months apart, so as you can imagine, we've always been very close. We always have done everything together, and still pretty much do. We have many shared interests. Golf, soccer, you name it. Except, now that he's in a relationship, a lot of the time we spend together has significantly decreased.Him and his gf are long distance, so they can only see each other on weekends, and even then, it's an hour and a half trip one way, and he always seems to be the one going up to see her. So pretty much every weekend he's not home, unless either of them have other plans. He's also wasting a lot of his gas, because his workplace is already over a half hour drive from our place, and to go up to her place is even further.Another thing I should mention is that she's a bit on the heavy side. I genuinely just don't find her attractive at all, I don't know what he could possibly see in her. She also has tattoos, which my dad does not approve of. He hasn't seen them yet, though, because she very strategically wears long sleeve shirts when she sees my parents, which has only been twice now.We met her over dinner several months ago, and I guess I must've been visibly offput, because my mom said after the fact that I was being very rude towards her. I didn't actually say anything to her, though, but I guess I looked really disengaged.Although I was still annoyed about my brother being away every weekend, the straw that broke the camel's back was the weekend that he missed a soccer match we have with our friends, which is a weekly event during the summer, to go to a function with her family.Though my mom pointed out that other friends of ours have missed games, too, I reminded her that the summer is almost over and so we would only have a few more games to play. On top of that, we film each game, so I had to go even earlier to set everything up by myself. I don't think it's right for him to ditch his friends and our weekly games over his girlfriend who he sees every single weekend otherwise.Now, we're going to a get together at our aunt's house for our cousin, and my mom told my brother to invite his gf, which he did, so now she'll be meeting one side of our family.Obviously I'm not happy about this at all, but our younger sister (18F) and our mom and dad are both fine with it, and are constantly telling me to \"get over it\" and accept that he's a grown adult who wants to settle down. I just don't think this relationship will last, and he's wasting his time. AITA?EDITOkay, so since I mentioned her appearance, a lot of people are focusing on that. Okay, fair enough, but let me add a bit of context as to why that bothers me so much. When my brother was younger, like early adolescent age, he'd make fun of fat people. My sister used to be on the heavier side before she reached her full height, and he would tease and pick on her for that. He doesn't anymore obviously, but he did. So I guess hypocrisy comes into play as well in my annoyance with the relationship.Also - it's not even just her appearance. She's quite irritating. She finds everything he says funny for some reason.EDIT 2So the overwhelming majority consensus is that I'm a major AH, apparently. I feel like, again, everybody is focusing too much on the appearance part of it and not as much on what I'm saying. Why is it only MY responsibility to get along with my brother's gf?? Should she not have to make an effort too?? I said after that she should've tried to make conversation that night we met her, but my sister said she probably felt uncomfortable to even try because of the \"look on my face.\"And again, I'll add - they're also on opposite ends of the political spectrum. At least, I thought my brother was, unless she's caused him to change sides or whatever. I thought nowadays difference in political parties was a bone of contention in relationships.

	"body" : "I (F20) am in college. In high school, my friends and I were considered the \"weird kids\" because we don't party, drink, or go out. To provide background information, we were bullied a lot and I have developed anxiety as a result. A lot of my friends in college have similar backgrounds, but it's much better now because the more \"social\" personalities that would have bullied us in HS leave us alone for the most part, so I am doing well now and am in mental health recovery.Anyway, with finals coming up and spring social events being in full swing, my friends and I decided to start a student support group for fellow students with anxiety. We advertised it on social media and held it in a classroom this morning. At first, it was going fine. My friends and I were very comfortable because the room was full of people like us and everyone could hear and relate to each other, so talking about how we were doing was very therapeutic. However, about 10 minutes in, a girl walked in that I recognized from one of my classes.This girl, to put it gently, is nothing like us. She is incredibly social and is involved in things like greek life and admissions, and there is no doubt in my mind that if we had gone to high school together, she would have at least been friends with my tormentors. At first, we thought she was looking for a sorority event or something, so we told her that this was the anxiety support group. She said she knew and was here for that.I immediately pointed out that she clearly has no trouble putting herself out there, and I voiced my doubts that she knew what real anxiety felt like. She said that she's been having a tough time with finals and was hoping to talk to people that understood. I sympathized with this-- of course anyone can get anxious from schoolwork, but it wouldn't be fair to have her there around people that have been struggling with social anxiety for their whole lives and wanted to talk to similar personalities about our shared experiences.I told her as much, and that maybe the guidance offices could help with her schoolwork, but that having someone there that couldn't relate to social anxiety and resembled people that only make this issue worse can make the space less comfortable for people to be open in, and that I wanted everyone to be able to be open and to relate to each other. She apologized and left.One of the other attendees said that what I had done was horrible and that I had no right to suggest that she wasn't anxious. That wasn't what I was suggesting at all; merely that it can be harder for other people to share their true feelings in the presence of someone who can't understand, but I do understand how it could have come across that way.AITA?UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your feedback. I believe some of you missed my point-- I'm not saying she can't feel anxious because she is popular, I was saying that her presence could be triggering for other members of the group. That said, she wasn't in class this morning so I wasn't able to apologize for the miscommunication in person, and to be honest I don't know if I would have been able to without fear of being ridiculed again. After talking to my therapist, we agreed that I wouldn't be able to seek her out and apologize personally for the above reason, but I still wanted to make sure she knew that I wasn't trying to downplay her anxious thoughts. I reached out to the guidance office to let them know that she was stressed about finals so hopefully they will help her manage that. I also let her sorority know that she had come to my group via their social media DMs. Idk how good a bunch of sorority girls will be at helping her manage her anxious thoughts (LOL), but she chose to join and hopefully they'll know her mind well enough to help. After all, she has many friends that should be able to support her.EDIT2: Wow, a ton of you continue to miss my point. First, for anyone insinuating that she doesn't feel welcome at her sorority due to her anxiety and was trying to make friends with us instead or that maybe she felt unsafe with her sorority friends knowing about it, she is constantly talking about how welcomed and close she feels with them, so I figured they would be a good support system for her. I really do think they'll care about her mental health and want to support her. Again, they're not the brightest, so whether they'll actually be able to do that remains to be seen, but those are her friends and they can support her. Second, why would a person be embarrassed about having anxiety? If people were going to be unsupportive that would be one thing, but as we've already established, she has people that will at least attempt to give her the support she needs. Anxiety isn't something you need to be ashamed of and hide from the people you care about. I hope she sees that now. But yes, I was TA for kicking her out so abruptly.",

On their own they are literal perfect angels but the second you get all of them together, hell breaks loose. So, I've stopped letting them have anything unless they earn it. Like they can't use electronics unless they clean to my standards and that awards them an hour.

She said I'm creating much more work for her than necessary and she doesn't feel that children should have to earn everything. She said I make her look like an AH in the eyes of her children, basically, because she's not defending them against what she and they consider controlling. This only just came out yesterday when my oldest step son asked where his battery pack for his controller was and I told him he had to do the dishes for them. He said he did the dishes and I told him it wasn't to my standards, so no he did not (cleaning counters and table is apart of washing dishes).

Lia’s birthday was recently and we were all really busy to do anything special. Last minute all three of us got invited to a kick back lia’s boyfriend’s friend was hosting and it worked out that we all could go. The friend told us to be there by 6 but Liz and I wanted to go around 8 because we didn’t want to go to a party early. I should have realized what was going on because lia’s boyfriend kept texting her to drive over earlier and he would pay for an Uber to come get Liz and I later. I told Lia to just wait for us to get ready. Lia drove and we arrive around 9 because we wanted to pick up some alcohol. I was so surprised and kind of embarrassed to find out that  the kick back was a surprise party for lia organized by her boyfriend . I felt kinda bad because apparently the boyfriend was trying to get in contact with us to tell us about the party but Liz and I had blocked his number prior to this whole thing because he dropped us as friends earlier this year. The party was really nice tho. We kinda just left lia with her boyfriend because he doesn’t like us very much. I feel like he should have tried harder to contact us so we could at least got her there on time and brought a present like everyone else. It’s around 11PM when liz and I want to go cuz it’s getting boring and like usual we are pretty wasted so we go to find lia. She’s all over her man but we say excuse us and tell her we want to leave. SHES SAYS ILL SEE YOU GUYS LATER THANKS FOR COMING??? Like did you not bring us here??? I tell her that she’s literally our designated driver and she could just drive us home and come back. She starts apologizing and starts saying she’ll do it but her bf like gets mad at us. He tells us to order an uber but we really don’t trust Ubers when we get drunk. I did feel bad because it was her birthday but like we were 30 mins from my place tho. Her boyfriend ends up driving us back and cussing us out the whole drive and he got really hurtful saying we were bad friends and taking advantage of lia. Longest 30 minutes of my damn life.

So, I call my daughter SAO-ER-SE, like what you would expect if you see the spelling. It’s still lovely and my daughter is proud of how there’s no other Saoirse in her friend group.A few weeks ago my stepson’s aunt picked him up to take him to his mom’s. My stepson introduced Saoirse to his aunt and she said “Oh, what a beautiful name! Let me guess, it’s spelled Saoirse? You know, the (people of my great grandfather’s origin) will pronounce it SER-CHAY.”The aunt actually speaks the language. My daughter was all excited to learn why her name could be pronounced so differently and the aunt gave her a quick 10 minute course on pronunciation. My daughter loved this new name so much she insisted on pronouncing it as the aunt showed her.

She is pretty flat chested and instead of dressing in a way that flatters her she wears clothing that looks EXTREMELY unappealing on her because it draws attention to her lack of a chest (think things like dresses, wool sweaters, sleeveless turtleneck tops).I told her that she would probably have an easier time on her next date if she embraced her body type and dressed more appropriately. I meant that as a confidence boost as in a \"be happy with your body!\" type way but she seemed pretty peeved and asked with what I meant with dressing more appropriately. I explained that her style draws attention to her lack of a chest so she should try to dress more like a tomboy instead of trying to look feminine. This seemed to annoy her even more somehow and she said that her tits don't define her femininity, and that her clothes don't even draw attention to them. I said that she can dress however she wants, but that she will continue having a hard time in the dating scene if she pretending to be someone she isn't instead of being herself. After that she asked the waiter for the check and immediatly left without saying another word.I talked about this to out mutual friends but they seem to completely misunderstand me too and they say I was being rude.

I've been a photographer for 16 years now and I've recently been getting a lot of shit for this.A couple of weeks ago, a couple came in wanting a maternity shoot which I was more than happy to do. The package was around an hour for the shoot. We sat down to discuss what photos we'd do when the husband speaks. He asks if when we do the pictures where he's behind her with his arms around her, that he stand on a box or something to make himself taller. I must admit that the height difference was amusing. Him at around my height at 5'4 and her at say 5'8. I looked at the wife and asked her what she thought of it. His wife was in agreement to this. She said it was her idea as he's always been a bit self conscious and this made both of them feel better.I won't lie, I laughed and shook my head. I thought it was a ridiculous request. It's 2023, a man can be comfortable within himself to not be bothered about things like his height. I asked what they did at their first maternity shoot and apparently they didn't have a professional one (they already have a child) because of COVID so they did their own home phone ones.The husband got a bit red either from anger or embarrassment but he asked they could just cut that portion out entirely if the box trick was going to be an issue. Unfortunately I'm on a schedule and I have to do things according to this plan so no, I couldn't just cut a section out. I told them this and they said they wouldn't be needing my services and left.I told my friend about how strange this interaction was but she said I should've just done it. It was money and their shoot. Well it's my studio so I have a say in what happens at it? A few other friends have said the same but my sister said it was fair enough. He should've just sucked it up for an hour. Not even that.Idk now. I feel bad but I don't? Am I the asshole? Should I invite them back and just do it?EDIT; To answer what I see in the comments. When I mean schedule, I go through the photos in an order. Set A, B, C, D, so on and so forth. It messes me up when that order is changed and I can't think straight. You're right, it would've taken less time but not for my brain to process.Secondly, you're all angry at the fact I said the height amused me. The height difference was amusing. I'd never noticed before but seeing a man who looks like he goes to the gym with tattoos and what not, be shorter than his wife was bizarre to me? I can't explain it.I did call them and apologize, offering my services again (with the box) at a reduced rate and they told me they'd think about it.",

	"body" : "I (29M) am engaged to this girl named Maaya (29F). I love Maaya so much and we're getting married this coming spring. She's had a rough life, and although she has a degree, she just barely graduated with a 2.0 GPA from college back when she was 24. This was due to the fact that she was both a drug addict and a hikikomori during her college years, and it took her 6 years to graduate from a 4 year program. I met her when she was in the early stages of recovery, and now she's a happy, normal person with her whole life ahead of her.It's worth mentioning that Maaya is a locally successful musician, and she plays the guitar. She's a bit of a wizard at the guitar, and she can really shred. It's her #1 passion, and she plays both solo and with a band.Starting this semester, my girlfriend has gone back to college to take remedial courses, because she wants to go to grad school to study applied math. So I applaud her on her efforts to better herself. Her college has a weekly open mic at the campus restaurant, where anyone can come up on stage and perform in a time slot. So I've recently found out that my girlfriend has been performing at these open mics for the past few weeks. When she told me about this, and she told me about how happy it makes her feel to perform in such an intimate setting, \"enjoying her second chance at enjoying a normal college life\" (to paraphrase her own words), I kind of cringed and told her that she was being cheesy. I told her that these kinds of open mics are meant for 19/20-year old zoomers, rather than the semi-professional musicians like her. Looking back, it's an odd thing for me to nitpick about, but I nevertheless believe that this is the truth. When I told Maaya that she was being so cheesy and that she's too old for this kind of stuff, I could tell that her heart was sinking, and she just sort of made these angsty, embarrassed noises.Later on, I hit up Maaya's instagram page, and I saw that she posted about what I said to her about the open mic. Her post was along the lines of \"who knew something so small can hurt so much\". I was mortified and, honestly, furious that she would embarrass me by posting about our relationship spats so brazenly, and I got into a bitter argument with her that left her crying.

It's annoying having to stand by the fridge and it takes time, and I really use it because of this. The bottle is annoying to keep clean if we use flavor tablets (which I like and we use sometimes). So when I'm thirsty I will often go grab his bottle that's next to him and drink a lot of water out of it. Sometimes I finish it off completely and he gets really mad and in all but words says I'm being an ass by not at least offering to refill the water bottle or clean it occasionally for him as it's a chore. He also gets annoyed in general at me constantly drinking his drinks (or eating off his plate). I will often grab his soda before I open my own and take a big drink out of it and he will say it's not fair that I \"arbitrarily set this rule of one soda per day then drink half of his\" (it's never half - at most a fourth or third). So he will grab another then I'm mad at him as he now has drank 1.75 sodas and they're like $3 apiece.I grew up in a household where if there's a cup of water we just grab it and drink from it not really caring whose it is (three siblings, two parents) and germs weren't a serious concern among the family.  I will often tell him at a restaurant when they take orders for dessert \"you order something and I'll share it with you\" but he gets so annoyed at me and tells me \"order your own dessert!\"I honestly feel like he's being really petty as I've always done this in any previous relationships and with my family (especially my older brother) but he thinks I'm being an AH by doing so.",

She watches them from around 8am till 6pm. She also picks up our oldest two children (7M, 6M) from school and my two stepsons (16M, 14M) spend a lot of time at her house. She has a similar arrangement with her daughter and her two children (7M, 3F).Previously, my kids already spent a lot of time at her house and my husband would often slip her some money to cover things like food costs. The kids have always really liked it her at their grandma's house. She still has her two youngest children living at home (16F, 13M), as well as her niece and her niece's son (5M).I recently found out that my husband has talked to his mom (without telling me) about paying her to watch our children. The amount he wants to pay her would be around $80 a day and it would be out of his bank account.I am against this for several reasons. Firstly, he didn't even discuss it with me before talking to her about it. Secondly, I think it's turning a family obligation to help one another out into a financial one. Thirdly, it will continue to incentivise her to not get an actual job (she's been unemployed for 4 years). Fourthly, one of her brothers is already bankrolling her and bought the house she lives in, I'm not even sure she pays any of her household bills, I don't want my husband and I to be the next chumps paying her bills. Lastly, she hasn't even shown any interest in us paying her, it was my husband who brought it up, I worry he's going to cause problems where they don't need to be any.When I brought up not wanting us to pay her to my husband we got into an argument, and he thinks I'm being an asshole about it. His argument is she is essentially providing the service of a nanny and therefor deserves to get paid for it and as we can afford to pay her for it we should. He also thinks she's likely to use the money to buy more toys and crafty type things for the kids.I think if you start paying a family member for childcare where do you draw the line. I used to watch MIL's youngest kids all the time when I was on maternity leave and she was working, arguably I should send her an invoice. And like I said her brother already helps her out financially, so she doesn't exactly need the money. Am I the asshole here or am I making some fair points?",

The easiest way I thought I should do this since no one wants to go (but if it works out better that I have to bring the minors with me then they will just have to come) is that I offered to my 19 year old to rent my house with her girlfriend, they would live with the other three kids and they also have their cats. I'd pay for everything else, because it is still my house and I still have to come here for work so my thought was crashing on the couch or something since it is still my place and the plan is to sell it. I wanted to ease everyone into the process of me moving and not have to involve other family to take in my kids.My oldest has voiced some concerns that I just don't understand. Her biggest one was that since I kicked her out to light a fire under her to get out and live on her own and enjoy freedom, she feels like now that I'm asking her to come back and pay rent and live here again that it contradicts why I kicked her out.To me this is totally different. Another thing was that she and her gf (who lived here to for over a year) thought it would be hard moving back in loving with everyone again including me part time, because of how “horrible” it was and \"toxic\" it was and how they don't want to go back to a “dark place”.She added how the house is in rough shape, lots fo broken things that’ I’ll eventually fix, front door lock is broken, and some water damage issues, and also appearance problems.

Her idea was more so that she finds her own place and she did she'd take on my two youngest instead of maintaining a house, all 3 kids, our dog and her cats, cleaning, parenting etc. But to me it's a better deal financially and logistically for us all? And it doesn't feel right to have her take them on because then I'd have to sign a legal guardianship.She also says how everyone just wants this over with, just sell the house and I leave so they can start to heal. I have many reasons why selling would be more complicated right now, ans juat keeping them all in the same house while I'm gone and then crashing when I work for now just seems best for me financially and then like I said so no other family members have to take any of my kids in if I let them stay.There are so many details that go into it that I can explain if needed.So, AITA for proposing this idea to ny daughter after kicking her out?

She screamed and cried asking if I thought she was crazy or if I was unhappy, which is not the case at all! She is an amazing woman, has been getting increasingly emotional over small things and has talked about wanting to consider therapy.

My daughter has already moved out and said she will stay with friends this year. In order to make the most use of the free space, I'd decided 3 weeks ago to undergo renovations in my daughter's room and our home office. These renovations meant the destruction of her and the office's connected right internal wall and the mailing of all her things to her po box. Once finished, I called in my family and had them move into the now-renovated bedroom/office for the 3-4 week period between Thanksgiving and Christmas to save money.Now, the reason I mentioned this is because of yesterday's incident. My daughter, having just started to receive her stuff, called me confused as to why I'd done that. I told her about the renovations, why'd I sent over her things, and to expect more of them over the week.There was a brief silence (she usually does this when she is uncomfortable) and she explained how she couldn't take most of the stuff into her dorm on short notice and that she wished that I had told her the plan before renovating or moving anyone in. I told her that since she moved out the room was mine to do what I wanted with and that I couldn't hold any of her stuff as I already shipped it. I've come to regret being as irrated as I was and feel as if I could have involved her more but I was already on a tight deadline with the renovation and needed to move out as much stuff as possible fast. Aita?Update: So after my family and I finished eating, I called my daughter to see where she currently stands. She's ignored me for a bit but she just texted me asking if I'd finished sending her things(to which I answered yes) and that she intends to spend Christmas at her same friend's house.",

Myself and my ex wife have one kid, the oldest (16F), and then my ex wife has 4 other kids (14, 13,11,8) with the man she cheated and left me for. We make things work for our kid obviously. My current wife has hosted for multiple overnight days for several of my ex wife’s kids, multiple party’s, outings, etc. She does money cards for holidays for the kids at my request, bring snacks for everyone when we do sporting events (also at my request). We try to make everyone happy. My wife gets upset however because she feels like I’m doing too much and it’s ridiculous to be “all over my exs kids” I’m friendly and try to make the kids have a safe space since my ex is no longer with him anymore. We wrestle, there are two younger boys, etc. My wife comes across jealous of the kids and pushing her own daddy issues when she brings up that my daughter needs to feel like I’ve only got eyes for her. I told my wife’s she’s crazy and jealous for no reason and I won’t stop being there for these kids. AITA?Edit to add, my ex wife and I separated when she found out she was pregnant with her second that wasn’t mine. My daughter was two when we moved across county from each other.",

	"body" : "I (26f) have a neighbour who is a girl aged around 19 (I don’t know her age specifically) who lives with her family. I don’t know much about her, but I see her every day out on her balcony smoking. She doesn’t seem to ever be out her house and seems to be slightly odd. Besides that, I had no problem with her.About roughly 2 weeks ago, me and my partner were engaging in s*x when he opened the window because we were getting hot. After about 15 mins, I can hear that girl shouting up from her balcony saying “I can hear you clapping” “can you close your window”. My partner kept looking out our window at her to check if she was still there and she started saying “are you gonna close the window now then” every time he looked out. The very next day I was outside my block talking with some neighbours when she came walking past giving me a really dirty look. I just ignored her.Yesterday me and my partner were making love again, when about 10 mins in I hear her again basically saying the same things as last time. This time I looked out and said “can you mind your own business please, you’re embarrassing me”. She replied “then stop opening your windows, nobody wants to hear that, it’s disgusting. What about how I feel?”. I wasn’t about to argue out windows so I just closed my window but me and my partner were put off after that.Now today her mother pointed us out when we were leaving our block, asking us to “close your windows when you’re shagging” and that we’re apparently making her daughter uncomfortable and that she has PTSD. I told her that her daughter is making ME uncomfortable when shouting up to us while we try to make love.Basically she wasn’t having it and threatened us saying if it happened again she was going to make a report for “anti social behaviour”. Are we actually doing something wrong here? AITA? Please keep in mind how hot you can get when making love before deciding. Also for anyone who wants us to get a fan instead, we do have one but it just ends up blowing around hot air the hotter we get, which is why we open the window to let cold air in.",

	"body" : "A year ago, my stepdaughter (19F) came to live with me, her father, and her half brother (9M). SD came with a lot of mental issues rooting from her treatment from her mother during school. She has been a mess since she moved with us and admittedly it was not the best circumstance and she claims that she's improving, even though I'm not sure that I see it. She had a hospital stay about a year ago and has been in intensive expensive therapy since.SD goes to school and works at her school but she has very few hours and is not taking a full load. Since she moved in, she's had some responsibilities around the house. One of those responsibilities is picking her brother up from school and watching him  and driving him to activities. She complains about this, so I think you'll understand why I think she's being a bit dramatic.SD's medication was recently changed. She was placed on a medication that was supposed to eliminate her nightmares and allow her to sleep. I don't know how severe they are, but today was her first day on them.At noon, I found her asleep on the couch. Naps typically aren't allowed, especially on a weekday when she needs to be doing coursework and chores. I woke her up and she claimed that she was \"out of it\" and \"couldn't stay awake\". I reminded her of our rule and encouraged her to be productive. I thought all was well until I asked her to pick her brother up.About 10 minutes after she left the house, my husband came running in panicking because he'd discovered her laying dazed on the ground after allegedly passing out in the lawn. Honestly, I was suspicious. She's very dramatic a lot of the time and a hypochondriac. When I asked her what she was doing, she babbled about the medication also apparently being a BP lowering medication and she'd passed out from that. Her BP is often low, but I don't see how this could've caused something like that. I think she's just trying to get out of picking her brother up but now my husband is mad at me. AITA?",

	"body" : "Throwaway, my daughter is an avid Reddit user.I (48M) recently lost my wife to cancer a year ago. It was very devastating for me and my daughter, Emily (17F). Three months ago, I remarried to an amazing woman, Jess (41F). We’ve been working together for several years and she helped me out a lot when my wife was in the hospital during treatments.Things have always been tense between me and my daughter, as she has always been a ‘mama’s girl’. They’ve been getting more tense since Jess and her son, Eli (8M) have moved in two months ago.To give background, me and my daughter live in a 2B2B house. When it was just us, my daughter and I each had our own rooms. Now that two more people have moved in, Jess and I thought it would be best if her son slept in my daughter’s room. Emily originally did not agree with this, but eventually came around when I told her it was either share a room or take the couch. I thought this arrangement was okay, because once she turns 18 I’m expecting her to move out on her own.Other than the room situation, Emily has been hostile with Jess and Eli since they’ve moved in. I cannot understand why she could have this resentment towards Jess, who has done nothing but try to be a motherly figure for Emily.Now, we are planning a family vacation for me, Emily, Jess, and Eli. Emily and I had made the vacation plans together right after her mother passed as a way for us to mourn together. I extended the invite to Jess and Eli after they moved in so we could all feel like a brand new family. I originally booked two rooms; one for me and one for Emily so we could have our own privacy in the evenings. But Eli has insisted on his own room, so he can feel like a grown up on his first ever vacation. I told Emily about the new arrangement, and told her I could cover the cost of a new room for her, but only half. I can only do half because I am taking Eli to Legoland like he was hoping for this vacation. I am hoping that Jess and Emily will be able to bond while I bond with Eli and our family will be blended by the time we are back home.I expected Emily to be okay with this, because she is a lot older than Eli and more mature than him. Instead, she totally freaked out and went off on both me and Jess, saying she feels like not only has her mother been replaced in eight months, but she’s also being replaced by the son I have always wanted. I admit I have always wanted to be a boy dad, but that doesn’t mean I love Emily any less.I love Emily, and I really do miss her mom. But I feel like I deserve to move on and get on with my life and find happiness. Why doesn’t Emily want that for us?So Reddit, AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for asking a girl if she was sure?",
	"body" : "I (20M) am in a college class that requires a group project as the final. I go to a pretty good school, so most people there, myself included, are very intellectual. My group consisted of myself, three other people that have a more scholarly demeanor, and one girl, who we'll call L, who is not quite this way. Not that there's anything inherently wrong with people like this, but she's very bubbly and outgoing, is a cheerleader and sorority member, and is honestly sometimes a little childish in the way that she interacts with people, i.e. talking to us like we're her friends rather than classmates. While the rest of us will sit down and immediately get to work in a group meeting, she will ask us how our days/weekends were, what we did, etc. Again, I don't see anything inherently wrong with this and can appreciate that she makes the group environment more fun.However, the rest of us naturally tend to take each other more seriously in terms of information for the project. The way I see it, the time that L spends at parties and with friends is spent by the rest of us challenging and charging our minds, so it's only natural that we are more inclined to listen to more professionally-charged ideas. Unfortunately, this has culminated in more than one instance where L will give an idea, the other group members will more or less disregard it, and someone else will say virtually the same thing and be praised for their genius. When this happens, L will just sink into herself and concede that the other members probably know better. I know it's unfair, but I don't really think it matters who gets the credit as long as the project gets done well, and this just demonstrates L's lack of confidence in her own ability. If she doesn't believe in herself, why should we?Today, we came across a problem that had a bit of a crossover with environmental studies (an environmentally-friendly solution was one of the criterion), and L immediately piped up with a solution since environmental science is her major. The group didn't really address her solution and continued to think of others, but we weren't really getting anywhere. L rephrased her solution, but since she was so uncertain in herself throughout the project, I really wanted to make sure she had thought this through. I asked if she was sure and if she could do more research, and she said \"I don't need more research, this is my major and I know what I'm doing\". At first, I thought she was needlessly aggressive, but after thinking about it, I can see how someone would be frustrated at a group for constantly shooting down their ideas, even for someone as farcical as L.AITA?EDIT: Some people have asked and no, we are not all men. There is another woman in the group who is taken just as seriously as the rest of us. It isn't about that.EDIT2: No, I don't stand up for L when her ideas are taken. That robs her of the opportunity of learning how to stand up for herself.",

That doesn't initially seem like a problem, but I'm in a long term committed relationship and I want her to experience what I'm feeling but she never actively tries to meet any guys. I'm also pregnant and I've always wanted us to have our kids grow up together, even though she said that she didn't want children, I know she'll change her mind when she finds the right person, but it's just so hard since she won't even try to look for me. She always claims that she doesn't have any free time since she is studying at university and also working two jobs to pay her mortgage and bills since she doesn't live with her parents, but I know that she has at least two days a week where she does nothing. She also says that no one is ever really into her. I think these are just excuses though since she'll come home from work and say that a boy called her pretty, but she never asks them for their number or to go on a date with her. While I'd admit she's not the most conventionally attractive person, since she dresses quite emo which is out of place in our town, I wouldn't exactly say that she's ugly, just that she needs to try a little harder to be seen as more attractive. She seems happy in how she dresses and presents herself though, but I think it's a definite factor in why she doesn't get approached by any guys.The other day she texted me after one of her shifts and told me that one of her customers had told her she had pretty eyes, and that he didn't make it a weird compliment or try to push it further, and that it made her happy because it seemed genuine rather than creepy like it usually is. When I asked her if she gave him her number she got pissy with me, once again saying that she didn't want to date the guy and that she just appreciated the genuine compliment for once. I'll admit I got frustrated with her and told her that she's being selfish by not going on a date with anyone who shows interest in her and that she is running out of time and that she's never going to find a boyfriend at the rate she's going. I still kind of stand by those words, but out of anger, I told her that she embarrasses me by still being single at 22, that she's a shitty friend for not even trying to fix it, and that she can't rely on only her friends to be there for her all the time since boyfriends are more important since they may be a husband one day. She got really upset with me and told me to cool down before talking to her again and hasn't texted me since.I really love her and just want the best for her, but my boyfriend thinks I went a little overboard. I agree telling her that she was a shitty friend for actively staying single was over the top, but I really think she needs to learn that one day when all her friends get married and she's still single that she's going to be alone.So AITA for wanting my best friend to get a boyfriend?",

Like when my best friend broke up with his girlfriend and I started reaching out to her, my fiancé told me that I looked like a predator trying to talk to a vulnerable girl. Anyway. I have a friend (Emily) who often invites my and my fiancé to family parties, at one of these parties I met my friends sister (Sarah). Sarah and I hit it off. We talked and laughed for a good portion of the night. I guess my fiancé was mad about it because I heard from my friends mom that she noticed that we were talking and that my fiancé seemed upset. That night my fiancé mentions that I was a little too touchy with Sarah and she was uncomfortable with the way we interacted.Anyways, Emily invites me to an outing. I go with her and her husband but my fiancé is working. Sarah shows up for a while. We talked and we had fun. She seems like a really good person. No big deal. I didn’t tell me fiancé because I didn’t want to make a big deal out of it. We’ll later at another function Sarah mentioned the outing out loud and my fiancé heard so it became a big deal. She asked me why I didn’t tell her and I told her that it wasn’t any of her business and she was overreacting.So here’s the deal. I found Sarah on Instagram and I messaged her to ask her for her Snapchat so that we could talk more freely. She even asked me if I would get in trouble and I said no I’m not doing something bad. Well my fiancé saw a notification from her and lost it. She asked me why I would add someone that she’s uncomfortable with and why I would think that talking to her on Snapchat is okay. I told her that she can’t tell me who I can be friends with. She said that I needed to remove her from my Snapchat and I said no that she can’t tell me what to do. It’s not my fault she’s insecure. So am I the asshole for refusing to remove my friend?Edit: Thanks everyone for your comments. You’ll be happy to know that my fiancé asked for space to think about all this.

My husband and I both graduated from the high school that our girls graduated from and boys are currently attending.A long-standing tradition at the high school is a beach bonfire party for the juniors & seniors after Homecoming. The party is synonymous with drunken shenanigans and all that stuff. I attended this party both my junior and senior year of high school. They were always wild. Dark night + outdoors + drinks + being on a secluded beach + all your friends + older guys = lots of fun as a teenager, terrifying as a mom.I'm 44 and I realize now that some of the things that happened at those parties were wrong. Older graduates from the high school attended, there was a lot of coercion/peer pressure to do things we weren't always ready to do, and plus just being in the dark in a secluded place.My husband and I both agreed that we didn't feel comfortable with our older daughter going. A few years later, our younger daughter too. Our girls have always been trustworthy but we attended those parties and knew how intense they got. My older daughter was fine with it while my younger daughter was unhappy with our choice at the time but hasn't brought it up in years.This year our son is a junior and wants to attend the party with his friends. My husband and I discussed it and...honestly the concerns when raising daughters is just so different to raising sons. We agreed it was fine for him to go as long as he went with a group of friends and promised that he wouldn't get in the car if there was a drunk driver. He's always been trustworthy so we have no concerns about him attending.The problem is now that he's mentioned to his sisters that he is going and they are upset with us because they weren't allowed to go. I don't want to outright say the very difficult reasons why we were scared to let them go, but now they feel that we're unfair/sexist.

Brian goes to a college prep program HS in our city and is involved in many after-school activities and has a car to get around for them.  My wife and I both work so we can’t drive him everywhere he needs to go.  Also, we have made it clear since he was young that spending the night at a girlfriend’s house is a no-no.Brian has never dated, we figured he was just a late bloomer, but last spring he made varsity soccer and befriended a senior teammate, “Luke” (m18).  Luke invited Brian to his graduation party and after that they started hanging out a LOT over the summer.  Brian started to spend the night at Luke’s house multiple times a week, which is unusual behavior.  (I also checked Brian’s computer and found gay porn, but kept this to myself.)  We confronted him because he was out of the house 2-3 nights a week and he denied that he and Luke were having sex.  It turned into a yelling match.  Luke left for college in August and the subject was dropped.Fast forward to a few weeks ago, Brian came home and broke down crying after a swim meet and finally confessed that Luke had broken up with him over the phone at some point this semester because he couldn’t do long distance.  We comforted him and were very glad he finally opened up and we learned the truth.  However I informed him that he would be grounded from his car and some other things because he lied to my wife and I about having a boyfriend and sleeping at his house.He absolutely lost it and told us he wished he never said anything (which hurt our feelings) but did so because he “couldn’t take the pain anymore.”  He said I have said some homophobic things in the past (Disney shouldn’t have gay days, non-reproductive sex is dysfunctional, Gay porn is disgusting, etc.) and said he never felt comfortable telling us.  I told him frankly I don’t even remember saying those things, and I think they’re irrelevant/excuses for the fact that he lied about dating someone behind our backs.  Brian (like usual) stormed into his room and slammed the door.Brian’s grades and sports performance are now falling, he says because he has to coordinate rides everywhere and because he can’t hang out with his friends, but I feel taking away his car and friend time is the right punishment because he lied about sleeping over at his boyfriend’s house.

	"body" : "So I(53F) and my boyfriend 'david'(51M) have moved in together. My youngest daughter 'Lori'(21F) lives with us. My three older children have been moved out for years, but live nearby. Their father died almost a year ago.When my boyfriend moved in he expressed discomfort with having people in his home all the time. My older kids would come to visit Lori, and David could hear them all in the basement all of a sudden, in his space. David has some really bad social anxiety and didn't like not knowing. So I asked my three olders if they could call and let David know they were coming before they came in the house. Since then, they've stopped coming over all together, or so I thought. I really wanted them to get to know David, so I'm disappointed they're not making an effort now that they have a chance interact with him (Calling to let him know they're coming).Lori has been acting out in ways she never did before. She's ignoring me, snapping at me, not making an effort to do any chores. She keeps accusing me of not communicating with her, when really she's just ignoring what I am saying. She didn't 'know' that David was moving in with us, (even though she was told) because she just isn't listening at all. This is very out of character for her.Well, last week I found out that my older kids were coming over when David and I were out of the house, without letting us know at all. This feels very frustrating and violating. David is hurt and frustrated because he feels like they are being sneaky. WIBTA for telling my older children they are no longer welcome at all? I would still see them other places, just not my home.Edit: It was my home and David moved in with me. I didn't realize that was going to be important, sorry.Edit 2: The kids father was not a good man. I wouldn't say they're grieving about him as much as you're all saying. I don't think I'm rushing things with David, I have a lot of wasted time to make up for. I think the kids should be happy for me and understand the change in status quo.Edit 3: Wow, that's a lot of negativity over the fact I'm respecting my boyfriends anxieties. He doesn't like a bunch of people he barely knows in his house without letting him know. Lori can have her siblings over, fine, but maybe she should revisit her communication issues before complicating things. My kids have been actively cold towards David, whose doing a lot of good for me. Call me an asshole, fine, but don't you think an ESH would be more fitting considering they're ignoring boundaries to see their sister?",

	"body" : "So I (17F) was recently blessed with a little nephew about 3 months ago which I am so grateful for, but my sister (29F) has been off since he was born and even before then. Let me list out a few:Prenatal:- She didn’t want anyone to come to her prenatal ultrasounds aside from her husband (my BIL). They were fine showing us the photos from them, but she never wanted us to come. Additionally, she refused to do a transvaginal ultrasound which would have given a better view of my nephew.- Never let us touch her belly and was constantly trying to cover it like with a pillow or her coat,  especially towards the end of her pregnancy.- She wouldn’t let us be in the delivery room. She insisted on wanting only my BIL in there. She didn’t want anyone visiting her until after my nephew was born.- She really wanted to try a natural birth with no epidural even though she is a pretty small person. When my mom bought up trying a c-section, my sister wouldn’t listen.- Part of me thought she was faking the pregnancy, but I did see her changing clothes or taking on and off a sweatshirt and leaning back to stretch and there was very much so a baby in there.Baby!!- She doesn’t want anyone around when she’s nursing aside from my BIL on occasion. He says it can be painful to her and that she’s not comfortable doing it in front of us… why? We’ve all seen boobs before. Girl… it’s literally all she has to do. Her husband changes the diapers, plays with him, and all that. She just needs to feed him.- She lost weight pretty fast following the birth. Her stomach took like two months to return to normal, but she lost most of the baby weight pretty quick because…- She eats like a bird. At thanksgiving, she picked at her plate and when I called her out on it, she got upset. My BIL and her went into a room away from people and he got her to eat a bit.- She’s gross. There always seems to be spit up or milk or something on her shirt. I’ve seen her wear the same shirt days in a row.  Her hair is always greasy or tangled, her hands have these bruises because she does this thing where she cracks her knuckles all the time and bends her fingers back.- She doesn’t like anyone touching the baby. My parents can hold him and I can do, but at thanksgiving she wouldn’t allow for any of our family to hold him People are going to want to hold him and it’s a little selfish of her to not let them.Anyways, she and my BIL let us know that she wanted to spend Christmas Eve by themselves. The whole thing just seems super selfish to me and I told her that and now she’s not texting me back.

	"body" : "I honestly don’t think this is even a big deal but my boyfriend is being very sensitive about it, so I guess I want an outside opinion.We were at my grandparents’ house for dinner yesterday. My boyfriend has met my parents and grandparents but this was the first time that he met my extended family. It was all going very well until my aunt started asking my boyfriend questions.For context: We’re from very different backgrounds. I’m currently in uni and he is working as a security guard. We actually met because he was working private security for a friend of mine and he recently switched over to working at a museum. I’m 23 and he’s 28.He’s a very sweet man and the first relationship where I didn’t feel like I’d have to put on an act for my partner. I think it might have something to do with his working-class upbringing and it’s one of the things I adore about him.My aunt asked him normal questions (about his family, where he went to school, what he does for a living, etc.) that he didn’t seem to have a problem with answering them. When he told her about his job she asked if that’s what he wants to do for the rest of his life or if he’s planning on getting a serious career. He told her that he likes his job and doesn’t plan on changing it any time soon.She then looked at the both of us and made a comment along the lines of “it’s a good thing your finances are separate then”. My father ended up changing the topic and I thought that was it. My aunt can be a bit direct and doesn’t always filter her words so sometimes she makes comments like this but they shouldn’ be taken too seriously.My boyfriend was quiet for the rest of the meal and didn’t say much on the way home either. When we got  to my place I asked him why he was acting like this and he said that my aunt’s comments were hurtful and that he wished I had said something. I told him that it’s not a big deal and that’s just how she can be and that he shouldn’t make a big deal out of it. I told him that if he ever does want to change his job though, I could talk to one of mine or my dad’s friends. He said he didn’t want that and that was the end of it for me.I texted him this morning if he wanted to come over later but he said he was busy this weekend. I asked him what he was doing but he didn’t answer me. I honestly think this behavior is childish and very unfair towards me.Edit: my boyfriend (not ex) called me back and asked if I had time. He'll be coming by in an hour or so. I agree that it might have been bad timing of me to mention my father's contacts but it wasn't meant to belittle him. Depending on his mood I'll try to explain my thoughts to him againUpdate: My boyfriend (still not my ex) came over last night. We talked about what happened. I apologized for not taking him seriously enough and he apologized for blowing things out of proportions over one comment. He agreed that at some point in the future (maybe once we have kids) he'd like a less stressful job but right now he doesn't want to. Neither of us even mentioned breaking up so you can all calm down. He's actually in the kitchen making breakfast right now. I hope you all have a nice sunday :)",

	"body" : "For the past several years, my daughter has been dealing with anxiety.  She has been seeing a therapist, taking medication, eating well, and exercising regularly.  She has had periodic meltdowns, but for the most part this has been enough.  However, in the past year at college, she has been struggling to adapt to living in the dorms.  Her last semester's grades took a dive, and it seems like all the responsibility is greatly stressing her out.  I was under the impression that this anxiety was only a phase and that she would outgrow it eventually, but it seems to have only worsened after she turned 18.To make matters worse, my daughter hasn't yet gotten a summer job, and I think her nervousness is making her seem weird during interviews.  With each rejection email, I'd gotten more and more frustrated with her therapists.  I was starting to be convinced that they have been refusing to help her for years, since the longer she has anxiety, the more they get paid.  However, my brother, who has a psychological background, told me that it's common for anxiety to get worse during early adulthood and that her therapists are likely doing all they can.  I decided that he was probably right, and I stopped thinking about it.  I think I deserve quite a bit of credit for that.  Today, however, my daughter came home from an interview, telling me that it didn't go well, and I had enough.  I told her that she was going to have to at least make an effort to be normal and that staring at someone's shoes, rather than making eye contact, would never get her a job.My daughter was taken aback by my frankness, but I just kept going.  I told her that if she thinks she will be able to finish college without putting forth much effort, she was sadly mistaken, and that obtaining a degree is going to help her live a decent life on her own when she finally moves out of my house.  She began to tear up and told me that I was being unfair, but I chuckled and told her that life isn't fair and that she needs to learn some social skills or she would almost certainly end up homeless.  The thing that infuriates me is that she can look my wife and I in the eyes as she's telling us these sob stories, but she decides not to make these same connections with prospective employers.  I told her that she needs to maybe go take a walk and think about how her actions were screwing things up for her, but instead she stormed off to her bedroom and slammed the door shut.She hasn't come out for several hours, and I'm worried that her delusional thinking (that she will just be handed a degree or a career) is never going to end.  I tried sliding a list of tips for making a good impression during an interview under her door, but I heard her get up and tear them up. I'm at the point now where I just want to kick her out of my house, but my wife insists that I'm being too hard on her.

She said no problem.Now for context, we've been good friends for about a decade, and this was one of our mutual friends getting married from our friend group. I'm the only one in our friend circle who smokes, so I would occasionally step outside for a cigarette throughout the evening. At one point a girl who was working at the venue was also outside on a smoke break herself, and we started chatting and got along really well. After about 5 minutes she had to head back in to get back to work.I started to immediately kick myself for not getting her number because I thought we hit it off. I kept an eye out for her in the hall but I didn't see her again. When the night was wrapping up, Kate and I started to head back to her car, which was about a 5 minute walk away. I couldn't stop thinking about finding this girl, so I told Kate to go ahead because I was going to have one more smoke and I'll catch up. She said it's ok she can wait with me. I told her again it's cool, go ahead, but she said she didn't mind.We started walking again and about a minute later I clutched my stomach and said I need a minute and I'll see her at her car. She became concerned and asked if I was ok and basically wouldn't go ahead without me because she thought I was going to be sick or something. After AGAIN not going ahead when I asked her to I grumbled that I'm fine and we walked the rest of the way to her car.Once we got in the car I snapped at her for not being able to take a hint. She was really confused and I explained that I wanted to go find a girl I was chatting with earlier to give her my number, and why couldn't she go to the car like I asked so I could go back and find her quickly. She said she had no idea that's what I was trying to do and to go back now and she'll wait for me. I said it's pointless now because she came outside with some garbage and saw us walking together so she's going to assume I have a gf. Kate said she'll come with me to clear up that we're just friends and I said to forget and told her she's a huge c*ckblock for not taking a hint.The car ride home was complete silence, and when I got home I started ranting to my roommate about what happened.

	"body" : "I (31M) and my wife (32F) have been married for over 3 years, together for nearly 10. We have a child who is now nearly 2 years old. Obviously, during pregnancy there can be substantial weight gain, and I know it is difficult to lose baby weight.I have never previously said anything about her weight. I have explained that when she was ready to begin exercising again, to just let me know, and she can take as much time by herself as she needs. I had read it can take months or until a new mom is done breastfeeding before ready to exercise again. Here we are nearly a year after breastfeeding ending, and she snacks often and I’m noticing that she has put on more weight from this time a year ago, which was already a year post-partum.I had explained to her even before we were married that obesity was a rather large concern of mine. I shared concerns about my sister’s weight, and the effects on her overall health. I’ve stressed the importance of regular exercise and healthy eating. My wife used to teach exercise classes and worked out regularly. We have a child now, and both have full time jobs, so teaching classes as a hobby is no longer an option.I know people on here will think that she’s the mom, so she probably does everything around the house, and here is dad complaining about weight. We share duties, I work from home and do a lot of the household chores and cook most dinners. I try to cook very healthy dinners, but that’s ruined with her other meals and snacks. When I get a break, I exercise. When she gets a break, she lounges and snacks. She’s probably worked out twice in the last year, I had to spark it, and I don’t think she appreciated it.I’ve since kept my mouth shut to see if things change, but nothing yet. I’m feeling this beginning to boil up in myself, and need to say something. Everyone says to just applaud efforts, rather than confront, but there has been nothing for me to applaud. Looking at recent pictures of us, all I’m beginning to see is weight gain and lack of self control.I’m scared a day is soon going to come when I can’t even say I’m attracted to my wife. I love her very much. She’s a great mom, great person, but an obese partner may not be something I can continue with, as shallow as I feel about it. Don’t mean to fat shame or anything, but I’ve made known was my perception for a long time.How should I broach the subject? Do I suggest exercise schedules? Point out her increasing weight gain? Mention the concerns this is casting to me in our future relationship? I sure feel like an a-hole, but I’m getting to the point where something needs to come from my mouth.EDIT: There has been no medical eval to see if hormone issue. Suggesting that sounds just as bad to me, but seems to be the first recommendation. I have already mentioned healthier eating in the house. I stopped getting any of my previous junk foods to help show I meant it, but she still gets hers.  I stopped getting frozen pizza and pastas, she still gets hers. She hasn’t stepped on a scale in months. If I had to guess, maybe she lost about 10lbs of baby weight in the first year, and has since put on 30+lbs in year 2. So maybe like 50lbs over pre-baby weight. She may want a second child, but I wouldn’t want to at this trajectory.EDIT2: There have been a couple of instances where she says she needs to exercise, and may create an exercise schedule for the week. Then just doesn’t. When I try to remind her what she said, she get’s irritated like I’m the bad guy for asking.FINAL EDIT: Thank you to those who were able to understand where I was coming from, and could sense the love I have for my family. Thanks to others for criticism that was CONSTRUCTIVE, even if you couldn’t see where I was coming from. Plenty of comments were not helpful whatsoever, but I know where I posted, so to be expected. Ultimately, this is a conversation we are going to have. I believe my wife would share something with me that was troubling her about myself, even if she knew it would be tough for me to hear. Tough conversations are a huge part of marriage after all. This is still a health issue in my mind, whether physical or mental. I have taken away much from this post, and will approach this conversation very gently, with my intent being that we are there for our child as long as humanly possible. There seem to be a good many of you who don’t understand or don’t care about medical issues caused by unhealthy eating/sedentary lifestyle choices…maybe look into it yourself if you want to live a long healthy life (IATA).",

So is she, obviously more than me, but I think there's been a change.On a day warmer than 20C? She's sweating around her hairline and upper back. It isn't enough to stain her clothes but it's visible.She walks up two flights of stairs to get to our condo? Sweating visibly.Takes a hot steamy shower? Sweating afterwardsCooking in the kitchen for an hour? Sweating.Sleeps in a heavy blanket? Coated in sweat when we wake up.I brought this up with her a few days ago. She says she hasn't noticed, and she feels okay. She then asked me if she smells, and I told her she didn't smell but was often visibly wet from sweat these days. I asked if she thinks it's related to when she stopped shaving her legs/pits because maybe that's holding in more heat than she's used to, and she got upset with how I said it and suggested that I called her \"gross and dirty\" which I did not say, I thought we could talk about these thingsCouldn't there be something off or different if someone starts sweating out of nowhere?Was I over the line with this situation?",

We would often use playful banter and recently I started to do online dating which I am relatively new at.I have had pretty bad luck with my dates and I was simply ranting to her about how dry my dating life is. I consider myself to be a nice guy and with the handful of dates that I have been on, they have all ended up in the friendzone. So as a thought experiment, I simply said \"What if I just stop being a nice guy and take on the polar opposite and be the bad guy for once?\"I told her I was obviously joking about this, but it was just me letting off some steam. She took it as me asking for her advice which I clearly wasn't. She also took it personally which I don't really understand how that could have been taken as an insult. For context, I would often rant to her about different things and this was no different. When I want advice, I will directly ask and she knows this. I asked what makes this any different from all of my other rants? She says that I am sounding like a jerk to which I said I wouldn't actually act on this, this is just me exploring what I need to do to get out of the friendzone.Long story short, I apologized for how I acted but she cannot move on with being my friend anymore. Am I the asshole?Edit: It seems a lot of people want to add random facts to validate their own responses. You are alll entitled to your own opinions, but it doesn't make them right. Also, therapy? Really? How would that help my dating lolEdit 2: I'm done with this thread. Y'all are lacking sense of realityUpdate: Today I showed one of my dates this post and she thinks there is some truth to what you guys are saying. She highly disagrees with the animosity that you are all showing though. We are having a second date this friday so you were all wrong lol.

Overall it was a pleasant experience and she seemed like a nice person.  The trouble started when I got up to go to the restroom immediately after the deed and she looked upon my nude body and said “you are SO skinny and your **** is so big.”  I responded “well there are lots of things I could say about your body that I choose not to.” My words seemed to hang in the air and before long she was unceremoniously headed home in a cab.Objectively, I’m about 20-40 pounds light for my height (6’2) and she’s reasonably above her optimal weight for her age (not that there’s anything wrong with that).  Roles reversed, I wouldn’t dream of saying anything that isn’t clearly positive to her in such a delicate situation.  That said, after the fact I’ve wondered if I was in the wrong.I’ve always been self-conscious about my weight. I’m a skinny guy naturally and gaining weight despite eating, sports, and working out is a challenge.  I think of “you’re so skinny” as pejorative to a male.  On the  other hand, there was a clear compliment in there and the remainder was either neutral or negative while my retort was clearly negative.  It’s worth noting she didn’t respond to my barb with kindness (there was no “I didn’t mean it that way” coming back my way).AITA?",

	"body" : "IMPORTANT INFO: Since i’ve seen multiple people calling me racist for some reason: we’re both mestizo latin american, Liz is not black, she just has natural curly hair.I (26F) have a friend “Liz” (25F) since we were in high school. Liz has beautiful curly hair (dyed) ginger, I don’t know much about curls but looking at references i think she might have 3b or 3c hair.Last week she came to church with pin straight hair and her natural brown color. I was totally taken aback since she never straightened her hair, not even to formal events, and had been dying her hair for years. I asked what was the occasion, thinking she just straightened it with an iron, and she told me she got it straightened with keratin.I asked her why did she destroy her hair, and she told me I knew she had been really depressed and she wanted something “she could control”. I know she has been depressed. Around two months ago she underwent a knee surgery and has been walking with a cane, and just before new year her dog had to be put down. I get getting haircuts after being sad but i thought that was ridiculous.Her hair was the most identifiable part of her,  the way she would style it was very fun and you could find her easily in a crowd. Today i tried to find her at church and told her that without her hair she was harder to find, this bothered me because now she just melts with the crowd and isn’t that special anymore. At lunch i told her i missed her old hair and felt like she had lost her fun personality with her hair.She didn’t reply but i noticed she was upset, our friend that was with us at lunch told me that was mean, I didn’t think i was but maybe i should apologize, AITA?edit: okay i get it, i’ll apologize to her tomorrowedit 2: this morning at 9 am i texted her apologizing for my reaction to her hair. I told her i was just shocked at the drastic change, that she looks beautiful and i hope her new hair is easy to maintain. She replied with two audio messages 30 minutes later, i saw the messages but was too busy so I waited until i was free to reply. At 6pm i check the chat and realize she deleted the audio messages so I explained to her that i was busy, to send them again, but Liz replied “it’s fine, it doesn’t matter anymore” so i said great.Thanks to everyone who commented, I apologized and I think maybe shes a little hurt but we’ll get over it as friends.edit 3: today Liz was not at church, I ran into her boyfriend and asked where she and her sister were (she lives alone with her 15yo sister) and he is the one that drives them. He told me that she didn’t feel like going so she stayed. I texted her asking how she was and if could come over and bring them lunch, she answered that she didn’t want anyone to come over, that she was tired from work and didn’t want visitors. So i told her that if she needed to talk to anyone to text me.Around 6pm i saw an instagram story posted by her sister of the three of them in the movies (the story was posted like 2 hours ago) so i texted her that i wanted to talk to her and is she wanted i could go to her place or we could talk on the phone, it’s 7pm and she hasn’t replied so i’ll be waiting.",

Valentina is a neurologist and an attending. So as you can guess she has a huge ego and a tough attitude.I am training in the same hospital that Valentina works in, which is quite well known. I was checking up on a patient we had operated on who was now in the neurology ward for a stroke. Since the patient had a hard time understanding, I gave him handwritten instructions.The next day, I got a call from the ward, saying I am expected to go there as soon as I can because Dr. Valentina asked for me. I go there to find a fuming Valentina who hands me that sheet of paper and asks me to read it. I read it aloud for her.She said there are 8 people here includings interns and med students and herself and no one was able to read that except for the one who wrote it. So she asked for the paper. I gave it to her. She threw it in the trash and said 'it belongs there if no one can read it'. And told me to write it down nicely this time and hand it to her patient.I did it and I can't really say anything because after all, she is an attending and quite well known in her job. However, when I was over in their house later, I told Valentina this attitude was wrong and she could have done it more gracefully.She called me an inconsiderate AH for writing that instruction that way and said 'no amount of words could express how angry she was'. She said the patient had lost sight in one of her eyes due to the stroke. And the other could barely see. Valentina goes on about how she, as a goddamn neurologist couldn't read my note, let alone this poor patient.Kate later said she would usually defend me but she knew her wife's work ethic and integrity and wouldn't question her on these things.

I initially said no because I live an hour away and only see him 4 days a month, but his dad offered to switch weekends so i was considering letting him go.However, i checked his grades and saw that he has a D in one of his classes.  I emailed the teacher and she said he has been on his phone in class and unfocused and not doing assignments complete.I texted my ex who told me he has been working with the teacher, counselor and assistant principal and our son for the last 3 weeks but the teacher has been relatively non responsive, gives students 0s if they don’t follow all instructions to a T, and takes forever to update grades after the students fix the problems.  He told me he already turned our sons phone off during school hours as punishment and the D is due to one 200 point assignment where our son received a 0 for not taking notes correctly in class and he is working with the teacher to help him redo it and turn it in the right way and the teacher allegedly said he could do this.  He also claims he has been in contact with all his other teachers and he is not acting up in their classes and this instance was specifically when there was a sub in class.  Needless to say I have difficulty believing my ex as I am sure he does not want to admit our son is not doing as great as he thought he would be in his care.My ex also is attributing our son’s academic issues on being new to high school and the school district and is blaming me for “not having any oversight and enabling him” the last 4 years and him switching schools a few times and that “his last school district was not good and he never learned any good study habits”.  Which is ridiculous because I tried very hard to get my son back on track when he was with me until my ex got the judge to move him to his district. Also his dad is enabling him now by trying to get me to let him go to homecoming when he is almost failing a class??I texted my ex and my son and said absolutely not, no homecoming dance due to the D and his bad behavjor in class, that I will not reward bad behavior and bad grades.  I also explained to my son that homecoming is for juniors and seniors anyway and he will have the next 3 years to attend.My son is furious with me, and I feel bad but at the same time my work friends are telling me I am doing the right thing by disciplining him when his dad will not.",

	"body" : "Recently I (35M) got some surprise money from my grandfather. With it, I decided to do an upgrade to my desktop setup by building a new computer from scratch. Though the computer I had before was still relatively new, I decided upgrading my rig would help me get more into 3D modelling such as Blender, as well as increase the quality of my video processing for my gaming streams to help gain some extra income for the house.My son (18M) asked me if he could have the old computer, as he was hoping to get more involved with this weird hobby he has with recording VHS tapes. He's been doing it at the library since they apparently have a setup for that and has shown me some of the videos he recorded, and I honestly just don't get the appeal. Two years ago I gave him my old Gateway, and while he told me that it wasn't able to do video transfers, I told him that he didn't need a thousand dollar computer either in order to do that.I have a hard time believing that the video transfer thing is what he truly wanted the computer for, and that he just wanted an excuse to play more video games as he's done before. While he is an adult, he's still only in Grade 11 due to delayed development as a kid. I only gave him the Gateway for homework purposes, but since I gave it to him he's barely touched it, so I'm having trouble believing he'd have put the newer one to use considering he hasn't been productive with what he has now.I was originally planning on selling the computer on Kijiji, but I had a blunder the other day after getting in touch with an old friend for the first time in over ten years. He came over with his son, we had a few beers and whiskey, and I don't know what got into me, but next day I found out that I offered the computer to his son while drunk.My son was in the room while my wife told me, and while I didn't initially take much notice when he left, I shortly after heard a loud bang from the basement and went downstairs to find out what the sound was, only to find him standing in front of his computer which he had smashed the heatsink and motherboard.I was shocked, while I only gave him the computer after knowing it wouldn't have anything important for me left on it, I did have fond memories of it like playing Unreal Tournament with friends and using Limewire for family movies. I was frustrated, but kept my cool and simply said to him \"congratulations, now you have no computer at all\", to which he barked back at me \"not like I could fucking do anything on it\" followed by other curses at me.

I told him that if he didn’t clean his room I would throw away his coin collection. He told me that “threats don’t work on him” and that he had to work on something for school now.Well, it wasn’t a threat, it was a promise. The next day I threw his entire collection in the trash can.He came downstairs a few hours later to ask where it was, and he freaked the hell out when I told him that I had thrown it away.He said that I owed him thousands of dollars worth of coins, that I was the worst dad ever, “how could I do this over some fucking cleaning?”.But then everything went downhill in the past months. He’s refused to eat, he barely sleeps, he skips school and his grades have gone down. My wife says that what I did was completely out of line and that we owe him those few thousand dollars worth of coins. She also told me to mention that those coins were of sentimental value to him, because a large chunk of them were from his grandpa, who had inherited it from his dad, who had inherited it from his dad.I’m lost for what to do at this point.

She yelled that she did get more but that they're all warm and will take hours to be cold enough to drink and that I was so inconsiderate because I can drink coffee, etc. I love coffee, the smell makes her sick though, but I wanted an energy drink.Anyway, she was making such a fuss and was literally sobbing, so I walked the 2 minutes to the corner shop and got her the same brand but a different flavour, they were sold out of the one she likes. I was pissed that she was making such a fuss about this, so I slammed it down in front of her. She was still crying and yelled that she can't drink any of the other flavours because they're too sweet and make her sick.

So, when I told her my family decided to go on this trip, she asked if she could come too. I told her I was pretty sure my parents would say no, so there was no point in asking. I thought that was the end of it, I was wrong. Flash forward to a week before the trip, she asked if I had asked if she could come. This caught me off guard because she doesn’t normally push stuff like this. I told her that like I said, there was no point in asking, and it felt kind of like she was taking advantage of my parents’ kindness. She said it felt like it was a slap in the face and said that I was being ridiculous because she had refused my parents financial help in the past and that it doesn’t matter where they were going, she just wanted to spend the holiday with me. It really felt like she was trying to get a free vacation out of me and my family, so I may have been a little harsh about it, but I still think I was right. She said I was an asshole for calling her a “gold digger”, but I still think that she was taking advantage of my parents. AITAH?UPDATE: We broke up. She came over and was really upset about everything. I couldn’t handle it anymore and I ended the relationship. She said that was what she was coming over to do as well so maybe all of this was for the best. I just couldn’t take her outbursts anymore and just wanted out of the relationship.

I sat her down and told her that I was sorry for opening her door and I’d never want to make her uncomfortable but that Fluffy was HER cat, not mine, and there was no way I was going to continue to be kept awake and my sleep was important too and frankly, she was being selfish.And to my surprise she just burst into tears? I immediately reached out my hand to comfort her and she snatched it away. She eventually calmed down and managed to tell me what was happening.Basically, she has feelings for me and thanks to all the fun reddit relationships stories about roommates/housemates suddenly falling in love over quarantine, she was awake when she heard her door open and she thought it was me coming in to confess feelings towards her or for a cuddle or something? I honestly didn’t know how to react, it was so bizarre and I felt so blindsided. The reason why my friends were telling me I was an asshole was because they all knew how Jane was feeling. I had to gently tell her that I was very straight and I didn’t reciprocate the feelings but I appreciated her honesty and her friendship and I hoped we could move forward. This didn’t go well, Jane ran into her room and immediately locked the door.I had no idea what was happening for the next week or so until I came home one day from work and everything of Jane’s was cleared out. She left me a note saying she’d paid me out for the rest of the year but she couldn’t handle being in a house with me and thanked me for being a good step mum to Fluffy.I’m pretty devastated honestly. I think Barry (my cat) notices that things are weird and hasn’t left my side. I’m upset it had to end this way as I did appreciate her friendship and I feel bad that I hurt her. So I guess I will be trying to make the best of having my own space until my lease is ended. Thanks for all the advice in the first post everyone, just wish it had a better ending!TLDR; the issue was not the door opening, Jane had feelings for me, I got her hopes up and now she’s moved out.",

(There's 6 of u It was several states away and 2 of my siblings drove since they lived closer, 3 flew, and I also flew but at the end of the day so I wasn't on the same flight as any of my other siblings.My wife had asked me if she could come as she wanted to be included. I declined, saying this was a family only trip with me and my siblings. When I got there, all of my siblings had their spouses or significant other with them and everyone kept asking where my wife, Sara was. I told them I'd told her to stay home as I'd figured it would just be us and didn't expect partners to be invited. (Everything was planned via sibling group chat and while I didn't read everything, I don't recall seeing anything mentioned about partners being invited.)Later, once things had settled down, I called Sara and told her all of the partners were here too and everyone missed her. I also apologized for not realizing partners were invited. She then asked if she could get a last minute ticket and come join us. While we can afford for her to, it's near the holidays and last minute flights now are expensive and we'd be on a very tight budget until the next time either of us gets paid, too tight for my comfort. So I ended up telling her no, it's not really in the budget and to enjoy having the house to herself for the week.Sara said I was being unfair and if I could take a week long vacation without her, she deserved to do the same. I told her this wasn't intentional, and her leaving for a week would be purely retaliatory and petty. Sara said if I wasn't going to let her fly out and join us, it was only fair she gets to take a vacation too, instead she's stuck at home where she's got to work, take care of my 3 dogs, (our 19yo neice would happily crash at out place and watch the dogs if we asked) take care of the house, and it's going to be raining all week so its very dreary there. I told Sara she's being ridiculous and I don't have time for this as I've got plans to go out. She called me a jerk and hung up. She's ignored my calls and texts since. AITA?",

	"body" : "Hello! I just want to mention my cultural background, so maybe that will adjust some of your judgement (because I hear how bad the title sounds). Basically, my husband is one of three brothers and they all got married around the same time. All us ladies had kids at around the same time, and my SIL (Call he Dee) was a SAHM like me and other SIL until her youngest kids turned 2. She has a wonderful career that she loves, so returned to it. She doesn't really need to work as all our families are very fortunate in the finance department. But it does mean she has less time to do the sort of domestic things we do, so I wanted to mention it because maybe she's just used to doing quick meals all the time.Anyway, for one of our holidays we rented a big property. It had a huge rumpus room for the kids and was on a five acre property. It was only for three days, so between us the couples came up with a schedule where we each picked a day to cook so the others can take a break. Additionally, all the couples had a day with all the kids (at least nine under 11).On Dees day, she woke up and spent time with all the kids with her husband. They made pancakes with the kids, and then all the other meals for the rest of the day she just made stuff she had pre-prepared earlier, like marinated roast chicken (just stuck in the oven), or bbq chops (she had premade all the sides). Dessert was ice cream and trifle (basically very easy stuff). In comparison I and other SIL had put on desi full feasts so everyone had a really nice day. Ofc that also meant a massive kitchen cleanup. We didn't mind at all, but we're a bit disappointed that one of our days wasn't reciprocated in the kitchen by Dee.Is this a petty thing to bring up? I haven't been in the workforce since I got married, so maybe I'm overthinking this. Thanks",

	"body" : "On Christmas Eve, my family got together at my aunt's house and had a feast. It was a potluck, so my wife and I came with her homemade green bean casserole. It was a great occasion to catch up with my extended family, some of whom I hadn't seen in years. After dinner, my aunt made a pot of coffee, and someone noticed that \"It's a Wonderful Life\" was playing on TV.I consider this movie a Christmas classic, and I've probably seen it a dozen times or more, but my wife had never seen it, so we sat down and watched it from start to finish. When we got to the part where George Bailey is taken around Bedford Falls by Clarence, my wife began to cry. I asked her what was wrong, and she said that it was tragic that George had all sorts of opportunities in life, to get educated, travel, etc., and personal matters keot getting in his way. I couldn't believe that this was her reaction, as she had clearly missed the entire point of the movie. George was about to jump off the bridge because he was mistaken that his life was meaningless.I turned to my wife and asked if it would be better if Mr. Potter had taken over everything, and she said that \"both options were sad.\" One of the options was clearly sadder than the other, and I didn't see any of my other relatives crying. I told my wife that she was embarrassing us with her reaction and that she should stop crying. She was ruining what was meant to be a happy and lighthearted Christmas film, and I'm convinced that she was disturbing my family as well. When we finally left, my wife had pulled herself together, and she told me in the car that I had been cruel to her. She said that the \"only one who embarrassed us was me\" and that people have \"different reactions to movies.\" I asked her if anyone laughed at the end of \"Old Yeller,\" and she kind of went silent and shook her head. She muttered under her breath \"You're such an asshole.\"I don't know what to even say to her. Christmas Day was quite awkward, and she barely said two words to me. I hope this treatment doesn't continue through New Year's, but my wife seems determined to be mad at me.

If anyone wondering, we talked and agreed that while this was the first time I acted like this towards her, I definitely have issues and she agreed next time heñp me restrain myself and find a good therapist, perhaps even the same one she goes to.I’ll try to keep it short. But TLDR; at the bottom anyway.I have a bad habit of being overly aggressive when I’m losing in a game I’m invested into. My girl was working today as a guide at some outdoor activity out of town. She likes to call me whenever she’s bored , though checking with me if I am available for a call, so we could talk about something to distract her. I have no issue with this. However I really really dislike when someone disturbs me from my alone time. And I tend to snap at whoever distracted me.She called 2 times. First time I picked up while playing, told her that I’m sorry but I’m busy playing. She understood and hung up, while sounding a little hurt. I get that. But then she called a second time to ask will I pick her up from the drop off point after her work or she will just get a taxi. Unfortunately by that time I was losing bad and it so happened that I was violently cursing when I picked up the phone. She thought I was screaming at her and hung up crying.Now, I have two issues with this situation, she didn’t check with me this time if I am available and called directly which caught me off guard, second, I told her I was playing, but she called again, instead of texting me, and she knows I always respond. Now she’s mad at me and says it was a asshole move to scream at her for calling me. AITA?TLDR; Was playing competitive game, fiancée called without heads up to blabber about, I told her I’m busy, she hung up, then called again to ask something important and caught me at the right moment when I was cursing at the game and mistook my cursing as a attack on her.",

	"body" : "Hey reddit. I feel like I'm justified in this but based on a few arguments with friends I figured I'd post here.Me and my friends all go to the same college, and we're all in a group chat together. We all have a kind of edgy sense of humor, and we end up toeing the line or making jokes at the expense of other people quite a bit. More often than not these are jokes that end up using \"slurs\" or other language that's deemed offensive today. For contexts sake I should mention that none of us are black or gay but we say N- or F- slurs pretty often.One guy in the group has a history of telling us off for making jokes like these. One time last year one of the group members made a joke about his girlfriend that got him on his period or whatever and he left the group chat. We talked with him about it and his big issue was that he felt like we were bad people for cursing like that in the group chat. We told him we'd stop out of respect for him and we did, and he came back and joined the group. We've all been hanging out together since but I guess we fell back into the habit of making jokes like that again. The one guy continued to tell us to stop, and say that it was wrong for us to use language like that, but it felt kinda playful like he didn't really mean it so we brushed it off.Well, I guess it was less playful because he reported us to the faculty of the school we go to. We all had to have meetings with somebody from the office of discipline. We felt really hurt and betrayed by our so called \"friend\". We basically got him in a room and asked him why he felt the need to report us and he tried to deny it, but then said that he wished he DID report us because the language we used and the jokes we made were \"sickening\". This is where I kind of lost my temper and started yelling. I told him that he was way out of line for reporting us to the office, that he was a snake for it. I have a scholarship and a job offer and he literally gambled it all over something as little as a few curse words or dark jokes- JOKES- about his girlfriend. He told me that he knew we weren't really joking and that we deserved what we got. We're still in college, we have our whole lives ahead of us. It isn't fair of him to risk my scholarship and my future career over a few mistakes we made when we were kids.We haven't talked to him since. We're basically his only friends so nobody knows what he's been up to. I was complaining about the whole situation to a friend from high school when he said that I was an ass for yelling, that I should have just stayed calm about it.

I pleaded with her,she still relented, but I ended up just leaving them with her despite her protests. It took longer than I said it would, and we got back nearly 2 hours later. The moment we walked in she gave me a dirty look, and when my friend and her kids left the house, she freaked on me. She told me I was way longer than I said I'd be, that I lied about it, and that the kids were horrible. She claimed to be exhausted emotionally, and that it was unfair of me to leave the kids with her for over an hour extra, without ever contacting her to let her know I'd be longer. I told her she was being unreasonable, and that I've done a lot for her recently; it was the least she could do. I later told her she was selfish for causing a scene, despite how \"exhausted\" she mightve been. A few days later, I again asked her to babysit them. My friend and I had to run to town, I told her we'd be an hour at most. The trip went badly, and I got a flat tire. To make things worse, on my way back I hit one of the kids she babysits' (6f) bikes. When I arrived, Jane was visibly upset. In private she told me it was unfair of me to leave for 3 hours when I said an hour at most, and not message her at all to let her know I'd be late. I told her I hadn't been gone for 3 hours, but she insisted. When i told her she was lying, she showed me valid proof. She also asked what she was going to tell the owner of the bike (The little girl just turned 6 today, and Jane and her planned on celebrating her birthday tommorow. Jane said the day would now be ruined for her.) I told her it's not my fault, one of the kids moved it today. She then got even more upset, because that means that it was one of my friend's kids who moved it, and I didn't even offer to pay for the damages. I just repeated that it wasn't my fault. We argued back and forth for a bit, I said she babysits all the time so doing it more no big deal. She said that these kids are super needy, and always need her to be engaged with them in an activity and she cant take her eyes off of them. I told her that if she ever took her eyes off her phone she'd know that thats what babysitting is. She disagreed, saying that they wouldnt sit still and just do something simple like watch a movie, they needed to be active WITH HER at all times.  She told me that it's as if I don't care at all about her time, because I'm always late and not taking responsibility for it. She said she won't keep doing me these favours if I won't be honest about what they really entail. I called her selfish for being upset over doing me a favor, and she walked off. AITA?",

We have a set time everyday to call so we avoid scheduling anything during that time as much as possible.I'm flying out on Friday for a competition in which my team and I will be representing our university. During this time, I won't be able to talk to him at all for the next several days (phone policies + being busy with the competition). Thursday at our usual time is the last time we would be able to call before I leave.This is where the problem started... After I told him how I wouldn't be able to talk to him for several days and how Thursday would be the last time, he asked to call earlier in the day on Thursday (mind you, I have classes/office hours earlier so this makes things very hard, at least to talk our usual amount of time). I was confused so I asked him why. He said that a video game was coming out during the time we usually start calling and that he'd like to play it then.I started arguing with him saying he can wait an hour and a half until I have to leave to begin playing. I didn't see why he had to start playing it the literal second it came out. He argued back saying that he'd been waiting for this game for years and that he wanted to play as much as possible before he went back to work (he goes back the day I come back. In other words, he has nothing to do all day except game while I'm gone). I explained that he can play as much as he wants while I'm gone and he'll have extra time especially because we won't be talking like usual. But he's completely refusing to budge on this. He says that he offered to call earlier that day and if that doesn't work for me then we simply won't call at all.Honestly, I was very angry. He knows how much time and energy I put into this. He knows that I am extremely nervous considering it's the first time I've ever flown out for a school competition. He knows that I've never been a captain before and that this is a really huge deal to me.I accused him of prioritizing the video game over me and he just agreed to it and didn't really see the problem. He says whenever I miss a call, that I've prioritize something else over him but I don't really see how that makes sense? If he ever told me he needed me or was not okay with me not calling, I would 100% cancel to talk to him (unless it was something I literally can't get out of).He said he was done talking about this and that his decision was final and I'd have to deal with it and then he hung up on me. I messaged him back asking what the fuck his problem was and now he's mad at me for swearing.AITA?EDIT: Not sure why I'm being spam downvoted for random replies I make. Like if I say he will be asleep so it's not possible to call, like why even? I'm just providing context for the situation :/EDIT 2: I don't know what game it is. All I know is that he is playing on his own. We had no conversation about this game beforeEDIT 3: This is not a vacation, this is a competition. We have a schedule that we have to adhere to, there are rules we have to adhere to. I didn't make these rules, I'm just forced to follow them. Not doing so can result in disqualifications. For those saying it's ridiculous that I can't spare an hour a day to call during it: I am able to call once I got back to the hotel!

Amy is the type who's a bit scatterbrained, always misplacing her stuff. About three weeks ago, we went hiking and she left her backpack in my car. It wasn't anything fancy, just a regular old backpack.I didn't think much of it at first. But as days passed, the backpack just sat there in my car, taking up space. I figured Amy must've forgotten about it or it wasn't that important since she hadn't mentioned it. To be honest, I was getting a bit annoyed about it cluttering up my car.So, after about two weeks, I decided to clean up. The backpack didn't seem to contain anything of value – I didn't thoroughly check it, just a quick glance. It looked like some papers, a water bottle, and maybe a shirt. I thought to myself, \"Amy probably won't miss this,\" and made the decision to donate it to a local charity shop. I felt it was a good deed, giving something to someone who might actually need it.Fast forward to last week, Amy asks me about her backpack. She said it had some important work-related documents, a spare set of keys, and a flash drive with sentimental photos. I was taken aback. I told her that I had donated it, thinking it wasn't anything significant.Amy got really upset, saying that I should've asked her before doing anything with her belongings.

	"body" : "My husband (38) and I (F37) recently got married earlier this year. My husband was previously married but divorced 3 years ago. He and his ex wife have 4 kids (9 ,8, 6, 4). When my husband I were dating, he told me that he wants to spend all of his holidays with his kids since he and his ex agreed they would spend holidays together with their kids so they could be with both parents (which I totally understand but didn’t think it was that serious). Well a few days ago, my husband I were discussing Christmas and I suggested that we go to my parents house in Texas since he’s only met them twice. He immediately spoke up and said no, because he wants to spend it with his kids. I told him that missing Christmas with kids for one year wouldn’t be a big deal. He was upset and asked me why I couldn’t just come with him. I work very long and hard hours at my job and I told him I wanted to spend my Christmas relaxing and enjoying my time off without all the energy of taking care of his kids. I just want to spend it with him and my parents. He called his ex wife and told her that he might not be able to come for Christmas, which led to an abundance of drama as his children were upset. I told him he is fine to go with his kids and I can go to Texas alone, but he said he wants to spend the holidays with me and his kids and doesn’t want to pick. I feel like I’m always second choice to his kids and it upsets me. I feel bad asking him to miss a Christmas but it’s our first Christmas together married and I just wanted it the two of us.Thanks for all your responses. I really didn’t mean to come off as nasty as I did in my original post, but it has been very very frustrating for me. I love my step kids, don’t get me wrong. But spending every holiday and weekend with them can get exhausting sometimes especially since I went from having 0 kids, to having 4. I understand my husband wanting to be with his kids, he is an amazing father and they are so lucky to have him, and they always come first, but i always feel that in not important. I just feel that my feelings are not being validated. Having to spend every holiday and weekend with them and not mine sucks. We spent Halloween, thanksgiving and christmas last year with his kids. Then new years eve, 4th of July, and birthdays with his kids this year. I just want one holiday where I can visit family with him. I don’t think I’m asking for a lot. I just want a holiday with my side of the family.",

Fine, I welcomed her with open arms.My son is not ready to be a dad. My son has a career ahead of him, soon to be his own apartment and drives a brand new Honda accord.

I told her that we’d hire the best lawyer in town for my son and that we will have rights to that child by any means.

We both had kids from previous relationships, I had 4 kids (20m, 22f, 30m and 32m) and he had a daughter (20f).Now, I love my husband and I love my kids, and I se his daughter almost as one of my own (I’ve known her since she was 13). The thing is I don’t get on all that well with either my daughter or my stepdaughter, I simply think that the boys are easier. My stepdaughter still lives with us from time to time, she comes over every other week or so. Like I said, I find her difficult.Ever since I first met her she has claimed to have “depression”, but I don’t know if that true, the girl just loves attention (she even claims to be allergic to nuts,no medical examination). I have managed her fits, her being “too depressed to go to school” and her general attitude and I think I’ve done my best to be a good stepmom to her.My own is just the same, claiming to have depression and anxiety due to her “bad childhood” and just sees the world her point of view, and in her point of view I have been a terrible mother. I think just like with my stepdaughter that I have done my best under the circumstances I have been in.The problem whereI might have been at fault started a few weeks ago. I had a few drinks with one of my closest friends while my stepdaughter was at home, we were talking about the struggles of raising daughters and I confessed to her I found it very hard to get along with my daughter, I said I honestly think my sons are much easier and It would be easier if I only had sons. Like I said, I love my daughter, I would not trade her for anything in the world, but she is difficult. My stepdaughter was in the kitchen when I told my friend this, and she got really angry at me, but I brushed it aside and told her that was just how I felt.Now at a recent family dinner my stepdaughter had apparently told my daughter I said this, and they both confronted me. They said I had always been rude to them both, emotionally abused them and would always get mad at them while the boys get praise. I guess the whole thing got a bit out of hand and I might have been rude and screamed at them when it was not needed. But I honestly tried to tell them that I just feel like I get along with the boys better and are better at handling boys emotions and it’s not like I don’t love them just because I get along better with my boys.I understand we all might have overreacted a bit at that what I said could be hurtful out of context, but the both of them refuse to talk to me because of this. But I honestly think we just need to talk trough it and that they are being childish.Am I completely in the wrong here?",

	"body" : "My GF and I have been living together for 5 months now. It’s been a bit of a learning curve but we’re adjusting. But like every couple, we have our episodes of bickering. To preface I am a very particular person. Especially with the correct use of utensils, placement of items in the household such as food and appliances and most relevant not leaving dishes overnight. With that being said my GF and I have a set of “terms and conditions” that we mutually abide by in the relationship. One of those being “ if one of us cooks, the other washes the dishes”. Now, I actually hate doing the dishes. Before this condition was set in stone it was an unspoken tradition. Though on occasion she would cook and I would ask her to clean and vise versa. To eliminate that frustration we had made this rule.  When she makes dinner I always wash the dishes before we go to bed, while she’d rather do them in the morning which I CAN’T STAND. Growing up I was never allowed to leave dishes over night and now it has stuck with me. It’s not only unsanitary but it can attract bugs. My GF just doesn’t understand that and we bicker about it every other day. Today I had enough.  I cooked like most days, and after I  relaxed and got comfortable. With it getting late I had insisted on my GF doing the dishes since she said she would after dinner. She gives me her signature line “can’t I just do it in the mornin?” NOOOO GOD NOO WHY CANT SHE JUST  DO THEM. Like she knows it makes my skin crawl, that’s why we have that condition. But after talking about it I realized I may have been dramatic and apologized for my reaction. BUT THEN SHE HAD THE AUDACITY TO SAY, “I’ll do half tonight and the other half tomorrow” LIKE THAT DEFEATS THE PURPOSE, THERES STILL DISHES IN THE SINK OVERNIGHT RIGHT!?! She believes that I am “doing too much” and that they will get cleaned eventually. I threw a fit and asked her “how did that make any sense?” To she followed with “Don’t worry about it there is no compromising with you, it has to always be your way”.

I told her so, she was ok, and we kept contact.When pandemic hit, she was diagnosed with some disease, and told that her lifespan will not be longer than 10 years more. She often talks about this, matter off handly because she's lively and overall a happy person, but she does talk about it.Anyway, her home studio is full of stuffed animals and toys, funkos, RGB lights and whatnot. I get it.In the last few months, despite her condition, she has started to look gorgeous, she appears to be taking better care of herself, she has never looked that good, so I talked to her and she told me she does still harbor feelings for me. I was so happy, but I needed some time to think, and reorder my stuff because I just finished another relationship, she said she understood.Anyway, yesterday, I see in her Instagram stories a plushie from some game she likes, with a caption that read that it was a gift from a male that had \"paid attention to her tastes and got it for her\", I was hurt and went over her house to talk about it. First thing I saw when entering was the damned plushie sitting on her desktop, it made me so mad, and, this is where I might be an ass, I asked why she was accepting gifts from other males, when she recently told me I'm the one she is interested in. She gave me a weird look and told me she can't waste her time waiting for me to \"make up my mind\" and losing potential partners that could love her, sickness and all. I swear, it was not my intention, but I snapped and told her those guys are not actually interested on her, they just pity her because she talks so much about her sickness that she must be fishing for some empathy. I regretted it the minute I said it because she started crying and told me to leave or she would call the police, which was ridiculous, so I left, hoping that today, she would have cooled off and we could talk about it. Only to find myself blocked everywhere.I reached out to mutual friends, and most of them called me an asshole, saying that she doesn't want to see me again, that I was cruel and insensitive, but I was just mad, over what I think, is a very rational reasonSo Reddit, really, AITA here?",

Also my wife's ex died in a sad incident in 2015.We met online, she was living in another city not far away. We started visiting each other and eventually got married. She moved into my house with her son.Her son is an amateur photographer and graphic designer. He has worked for a couple of small magazines and micro influencer. I don't know how much, but he makes money from that. He's never taken any money from me. I've never seen him take anything from my wife either.At first he was good with me and my daughter. We only argued twice and the second time I somehow ended up kicking him out of the house.I can't tell you the whole first one because then it's over 3000 characters. It's just my daughter said something about the troubled guys he hangs out with. I warned him. He didn't argue, but he was very irritated. After that day, he continued to be nice to me and my daughter, but it was very fake.Last week he had a photo shooting job and came home late. I told him that my house has an in and out rule and he shouldn't be so late. He calmly told me that he didn't come because he was working. I said him, \"I understand, but there are rules in this house.\"He said, \"Your house, your rules, but I don't think I can follow them when I'm working, sorry.\" That made me mad and I said \"Maybe I need to think about some things.\" He responded, \"Like what?\" Call me dumb for being provoked by a kid, but I got really pissed off and said, \"Like kick you out.\" His mom tried to calm him down, it didn't work. He said, \"Think about it. I'm waiting.\"I don't want to tell the whole conversation, but in the final I told him, \"Then get out of my house.\" He asked to my wife, \"Do you have anything to say about this?\" When she said, \"Let's sit down and talk in peace,\" he went to his room and locked the door.Two hours later he packed all his things, called a taxi and left the house. When I asked him to stop, he said, \"Think twice before you speak.\" My wife cried and begged, but he didn't listen to her either.The next day in the evening he called my wife. He was back in his home city, staying with a friend for a while and then renting a house. He's a minor, I don't know how he's going to rent a house, but he's already not supposed to get on a plane or bus by himself. I really don't know how he got back. Cunt is really like one of those annoying kids in sitcoms. Wife had told me before that he was very stubborn, just like his father, but I didn't expect this much.Things have been going downhill with my wife. I don't know what to do. AITA?Edit: I have to say, I really didn't mean to kick him out. I just didn't think he was really going to leave.

And so I was like \"ARE YOU SERIOUS?\" to my mom and about how I didn't like her and it should be obvious.

We currently live together with two other girls, her best friend and a close friend of mine.She comes home to the apartment in tears with her best friend who was consoling her. I didn’t talk to her until that night, when she felt better.She said sorry about my behavior, I said it was no problem. She frequently complains to me about her mom, so I’m use to it but she launched into a story about how she went to the bank to open up her first credit card, and found out she had a credit card open that was maxed out with 2,500 spent on it. She said her mom opened up a credit card on her name, hid it from her, and she had no idea. She admitted her mom did make payments on it every month.I told her it didn’t seem like a big deal at all, it sounds like her mom is building her credit and she’ll thank her in the future. I said if she’s making the payments, there is nothing to worry about.She said no, but she’s only making minimum payments and even then she’s spending what she put in. I asked if she said she would pay it back and she said “yes but.”I said no buts, she is making a big deal about something silly. Her mom is helping her build her credit, she should be grateful. She said but the credit card is maxed out, and has been at 2500$ for the past year.I said again she’s making payments, be grateful. I asked if she even knows anything about credit and she admits she doesn’t, but that she knows enough to know this is really bad. Her mom doesn’t have the money to pay it back. I asked how she knows that, is she in her bank account? If no, she should shut up and give her a chance to pay it back.She said “Why do you have to do that? Why can’t you validate my feelings?

She goes to the same school as Kay. She’s 17, same age as me. We hang out because of Kay, but we just don’t click. Her father wants to be an elder at our church (this is important).Over two months ago, I was with Kay. She said that Lacy told her a secret that she shouldn’t tell anyone, but she wanted to tell me. Before I could stop her, she told me that Lacy told her she was a lesbian.Lacy being a lesbian is a big problem if her father wants to be an elder. We believe that in order for a man to be an elder, his family has to be in order, too. If it gets out to other members of the church, he’ll never be an elder. If he does become an elder and it comes out, he’ll have to quit. It would be a social mess. My church experienced an elder gone bad (he was a charming narcissist) when I was a kid. It ripped the church in half and I lost friends. I felt like I needed to do something. I felt like it’d be too weird to talk directly to her parents, so I told my parents so they could talk to Lacy’s parents. They did. Apparently, Lacy’s father thought it didn’t matter because Lacy is an adult and her behavior has nothing to do with him. I mean, we’re almost adults, but I don’t think anyone thinks that. She still lives with her parents. I know he can’t just tell her not to be a lesbian. My parents thought it’d be best to tell another elder. Then there was a decision that Lacy’s father wouldn’t be an elder.A couple of weeks ago, Lacy came to me. Her parents are now really angry with her. She asked me if Kay told me she was a lesbian. I didn’t want to say she told, but I couldn’t dodge the question. I told her Kay told me, but I was trying to help her family and it backfired. Now, Lacy has told everyone that Kay can’t keep a secret. I’m pretty sure that accusation has spread at their school, too. Kay is so sad looking now. She’s polite, but she won’t really talk to me. She hasn’t been back to church yet. I think I ruined her reputation. Lacy is about to graduate but Kay has to be in that school two more years. Am I a jerk?

All of my sisters cheered in college, but the twins for my mom currently and my eldest sister just graduated. Although my moms denies it, I believe slight nepotism is involved as there’s not a statistical way I have 3 sisters cheer there without nepotism being involved.I cheered competitively pretty much my entire life until 2 years ago. I quit because I was done dealing with the politics on the team and the bullying I received from one teammate. My mom was supportive of me quitting competitive cheer as long as I did my final 2 school season which I did.I had always been very skinny and I kept that way for cheer, but after quitting competition cheer and with my school stunts being pretty much nothing, I realized I didn’t need to stay skinny any longer. For the first time in my life, I ate how I pleased and didn’t feel the need to exercise an excess amount, and I gained around 40 lbs. None of my friends or family have commented negatively on my gain until recently which I was very thankful for.As college approaches for me, I’ve decided that I’d like to cheer again. I asked my mom if I could cheer for the team just like my sisters, and she said no. She claims that because I didn’t do it competitively she couldn’t justify it and that I’ve gotten too out of shape, and she simply couldn’t keep her job if she allowed me on the team.My eldest sister wasn’t good at cheer at all, and the twins aren’t amazing. I feel like my mom is ashamed of having a daughter with fuller hips. I called my mom out on her fat phobia, and she claims that I am fat and if I can’t handle the truth I need to lose weight. This caught me off guard because in two years of me having a more full figure she never said anything remotely like this.I don’t want to be the only one of 4 sisters who don’t cheer in college, and I don’t want to just be a fat girl in the stands compared to my sisters cheering. My mom has apologized for her comments and has tried to say it’s more because I’ve not cheered competitively in years, but I know after her outburst that day it’s because of my figure and her embarrassment of my curves.I understand it’s nepotism, but there aren’t a set number of spots and it’s just who my mom wants. My dad is on my mom's side and said I understood that when I quit cheer this would happen, and my sisters won’t really publicly pick a side, but they have begun to make sly remarks on my weight out of nowhere. My friends do believe I’m in the right but know they’re biased and would support me regardless. I have begun portion control and lost 4 lbs, but it won’t be enough to get to where I was. I now rarely speak to my mom and while I feel like I have some blame I don’t think I’m the a-hole in this situation. AITA?",

I was wearing a black dress, demonias and black fishnets. My make up wasn't extreme it was pretty light and basic. I'd never been to a wedding before so I didn't really know how to dress so I thought a nice dress would be fine.When I got to the ceremony my mom muttered something about what I was wearing being inappropriate, then she walked away. I didn't say anything because I obviously didn't want to start a fight on my sisters wedding day.After the wedding, at the after party (is that what it's called? the party after the wedding?) my mom started complaining to me about what I was wearing and said I was taking the focus off I'd my sister because people were staring at me. People were staring at me but not for long there eyes just lingered for a few seconds and then I don't know they probably went back to thinking about how gorgeous my sister looked. I attracted some attention but not as much as my mom made out.A little later my sister came over and said that I was selfish for what I was wearing and asked me if I was trying to ruin her big day I said no and asked her what the fuck her problem is. She called me a slut and an attention whore and we almost got into an argument but she walked away because she said that she won't let ruin her day. I left not long after.My mom was texting me the next day and telling me to think about people other than myself for once and basically said that I just wanted attention. I just wanted to wear cute clothes I didn't think it would be such a problem? My dad agrees with my mom and so do a few close family members. No one is on my side but I literally don't understand why what I wore is such a big deal.AITA?",

It became a hassle, especially since I am a nurse and my husband is a construction worker, so we decided that we would take her to an ethnic stylist who knew how to deal with children’s hair and we got her a protective style, braids that I was told would last her 3 weeks.When we left the hair shop, her hair was fresh and neat, the next day I sent her to school and when I picked her up, her beads were completely gone and some of her braids had come down, I was furious and asked her what happened and she told me that “she didn’t know” and that she was playing and that her friends were just “touching it”. I was upset and told her that she didn’t have the same hair as her sister and that her hair was nappy and that she needed to be mindful of her texture since it is so hard to manage.She cried and I apologized, she told dad and my husband thinks I should’ve worded it differently to her and that I may have lowered her self esteem however I just wanted her to be more aware of things like her hair that will be important as she gets older and will start managing it herself one day.",

We have our squabbles but apparently this one has really pushed my girlfriend over the edge.Last spring, her parents let us know they and their friends were planning a group trip to Aruba and that we would be invited to join them. It’s an all inclusive resort and my girlfriend is super excited because she’s never been to a resort this nice before. I’m indifferent because I grew up in a warm climate, so I don’t understand why people from colder areas have an obsession with booker tropical vacations. What’s wrong with going to Europe?Anyways, we were told the trip would be in April, so we told them we were in. Before we paid the deposit to lock in our spots, her parents called her to let her know one person in the group couldn’t do April. Apparently, thats an end of the year time for their job and it’s all hands on deck, so they couldn’t get the time off. My GF let me know about the change before confirming with her parents we were still in. We paid our deposit and got locked in.At the time, I told her it was fine. Here’s where I might be the AH. We were talking about the trip the other night, this is literally all she wants to talk about. I finally brought up to her that I was annoyed about the date change as March is towards the end of ski season, and I like to get in as many runs as I possibly can. Also, it’s spring break time so the resorts are going to be flooded with annoying college kids.I told her it didn’t make sense to me to change the dates because one person couldn’t go. She explained to me that it wouldn’t have been fair for them to miss the trip because they couldn’t take that time off of work. She then told me I was being selfish because I go skiing almost every weekend and sometimes even during the week, I can afford to miss a few days of skiing.I personally just don’t think she understands where I’m coming from. She doesn’t ski, so she doesn’t understand my passion for it. I’ve also traveled a lot with my family, so I don’t see the big deal of this trip. So AITAH?Update: clearly you all think I’m the AH, along with calling me a narcissist. I’m probably just going to cancel my trip since I have the insurance on it, and use the time I requested off to ski before the season ends. I’ll tell my girlfriend at some point, but I’m gonna wait.

When we were listing out our individual monthly expenses he noted money put aside for a game that he plays with his brother and sister. The amount is $90/month. Now I can understand him putting some money on their accounts since they're both still in school (one finishing high school and other in college) but I feel $30 a month for him is a bit excessive, especially for a game that he's frankly too old to play even if he does only ever play when they do.I just found out that for Christmas they both asked for $80 worth of credits for their game and he gave it to them. To me, that's starting to get into alarming spending habits on something intangible and not holding any value so I tried to talk to him about it about how I don't want him to spend any more money on that game so his brother and sister will have to earn money themselves. My boyfriend refused and thought I was overreacting over a holiday gift since he doesn't go wild with it any other time and he pays for it out of money he sets aside for his fun and hobbies. He doesn't understand how irresponsible this is and how easily it could get out of control and that kind of money adds up over time. He could be putting it towards savings or expenses for us.

My ex-wife broke up with me a long time ago and I ended up with sole custody of our daughter. They see still each other occasionally but most of the responsibility falls to me. I'm not complaining and having her around has been such a blessing.For the longest time it was just the two of us, but a few years ago I met someone at work and remarried. She has a son from a previous marriage, Max (11) who suffers from autism. He's verbal but struggles a lot with socialising and interacting with people. My daughter is one of the few people that he feels comfortable around.My daughter (Kayla) is 16 now. She does well at school and hopes to go to university one day to study nursing. However we've had to deal with the usual problems like being reluctant to do chores, not tidying up her room, inviting boys over etc. Nothing too egregious but we've had our differences over the yearsMy daughter has been looking forward to a Muse concert for months. (We live in the UK and she's always been a huge fan.) I was hesitant at first, but she assured me that she'd be going with a group of close friends. I explained that she'd have to find the money herself, so she did odd jobs and saved her pocket money until she could afford the tickets.On the day of the concert my wife found out that her cousin suffered a bad car crash. She'd broken her leg, several ribs and needed to be hospitalised. They're practically like sisters so I agreed to take my wife and stay with her for support.Only problem is that we obviously couldn't leave Max by himself. We're not completely comfortable getting a babysitter because he's uneasy around strangers and has a number of special needs to consider.We hoped she'd understand, but she flew off the handle and told us how she had saved her money and waited months for this concert, which I totally get, but sometimes doesn't pan out the way you expect.My wife sat her down and calmly, but firmly said that she was nearly an adult now and needed to start being more responsible. She explained that Max needed to rely on his big-sister, and if she was ever going to get a career in nursing she'd need to be more mature. I thought it was little uncalled for but couldn't really disagree. Kayla snapped back and said she wasn't her real mom and it wasn't her businessEither way my daughter reluctantly ended up staying at home. Now she shuts herself inside her bedroom and refuses to speak to us. We explained that she can go next year and even offered to refund the ticket, but she keeps talking about how she'd been waiting for months and now her friends are going to be pissed with her. I said I was disappointed with her attitudeI feel bad for making her miss the concert, but at the same time I don't think my wife was wrong in what she said. I'm proud of my daughter but I think it's also time she started taking on more responsibility.AITI?",

	"body" : "So I (36M) am a medical doctor and I work in a specialized field. It took many years of hard work and countless hours to get to where I am, and I am very proud of my success and my career and my place in life.My sister Candace (38F) works in education. When we were younger, she was definitely the less focused sibling, and took 7 & 1/2 years to complete a 4 year college program as a result of changing of major twice. Her second change to an English major/education minor finally set her on a steady path, and she’s managed to develop a good career juggling teaching and writing novellas on the side. She has also spent the last 8 years slowly completing an online program for a PhD in English Literature so she can move up in her career field.We were having dinner with our parents (66M & 58F) and Candace was talking about her upcoming book and how she’d be able to have “Dr. [Last Name]” in the blurb under her photo in the back of the book. She said it sounds so cool to be officially Dr. [Last Name]. I laughed and said yeah, it’s especially funny considering I’m the one that’s an actual doctor. She said that “technically” she’s one now too. I told her no, she’s got a PhD, that’s not the same as being a healthcare professional. I said she may be Dr. [Last Name] because of some paper she printed offline, but I’m never calling her that and it’s an insult to my profession and the real, endless, HARD work that I and other real doctors put in  for her to fight me about it.Ever since that dinner, she’s been giving me the silent treatment, and I’ve had to hear it ever other day from my parents about how I hurt my sister’s feelings. I genuinely don’t understand what she expected or what I’m supposed to do here. All I did was tell the truth.",

	"body" : "I (37M) was out to dinner with a few of my friends, named John (36M) and his wife Eliza (33F), along with my sister Tara (38F) and her husband Matt. (41M) this past Sunday (10/22). A few months ago, J reached out to everyone proposing we get together, as we hadn't had time since John and Eliza had their first kid about two years ago. We started planning in August, and went to a French place that was difficult to get a reservation for. Everyone was able to make it and we all were ready a great night out.Now, I want to make it known I am a very big guy. I weigh about 126kg, so that inevitably means I am going to eat a lot. When we got to our seats, I asked the waiter what accommodations they had for a bigger person, as they tried to squeeze us into a corner booth where we could not all fit. I had a feeling everyone was slightly annoyed with me, as we had to wait another 30 minutes afterward for a regular table to open up. I mean, yes, I understand that, but this is a common theme when I go out to eat. I did mention it beforehand, so I'm not quite sure what all the glares were for.Everything was fine once we got to our table for most of the evening. Eliza commented that she would like to get home for the sitter at some point, and requested that we not take forever ordering wine, picking our food, and so on. Nobody took too long ordering the wine, and there seemed to be a general implied consensus to let John and Eliza go home sooner rather than later. This was mildly annoying to me, since we had booked this night 2 months in advance. I understand a young child, but there was plenty of time to prepare! I didn't even get to look at the wine list for as long as I liked.I have a massive sweet tooth. And this place makes the best souffle I've ever had. So when the server came to take dinner orders, I asked for the souffle right then, which I didn't think it was unreasonable to request it at that time, since that gave them time to make it. I ordered it with coq a vin, which they make from scratch. I was shocked to receive four glaring faces after ordering, and Matthew asked me to talk to him outside.Matthew told me I was being extremely inconsiderate, and even if we were planning this for a while, I needed to step aside. Having no kids of my own, this seemed irrational to me. I walked back in, sat down, and refused to look up from my phone for the rest of the evening out of protest. The souffle came right out when it was expected to, and John and Eliza were able to get home only about 40 minutes later than they intended to.So why is everyone so frustrated with me? Tara and Matthew have told me they won't be going anywhere with me anytime soon and they never offered any sort of explanation. John won't return my texts or calls, even though I've been explaining my side of the situation many times over.So Reddit, what gives? Am I the asshole??",

Saya is very close to S and my wife, and every time my niece meets S, she picks him up and hugs him very tightly. My son likes being picked up by Saya, and he reciprocates with her hugs.I hope this doesn’t sound too creepy, but I have noticed that Saya has large breasts. And, you know, every time my niece hugs S, her breasts are squished against my son’s body. It’s weird as fuck to watch. Not only that, but my niece always wears very low-cut shirts, which increases the “inappropriate-ness” of her hugs by a lot.So at a recent family gathering, I have taken Saya aside, and I let her know the honest truth: that I think her habit of hugging S is creepy and inappropriate. Saya just responded with a smug laugh, and she said “what am I supposed to do? Leave my tits at home?” She asked me what’s so wrong about her behavior if S likes being picked up and hugged, and she told me “I’d flip you the bird if you weren’t my uncle that I look up to” (paraphrasing here).AITA?

He excelled in school, picked up new concepts quickly, was the best at music, sports, good with girls, you name it.  After HS, I left and went to our states university and he went to a HBCU.  Since coming back, I’ve noticed over the years that when he’s talking to other black people he talks COMPLETELY different.  In comes the slang, the Ebonics, hell even the animated gesturing. However, when we are back with our old friends, it’s reduced back to his normal accent.  I mentioned something one time about his change in tone and he got a little pissed about it saying I should read a book and learn about AAVE, which is an actual language.  The thing is, I know about AAVE and it’s legitimacy, it’s just that growing up he DIDN’T LEARN IT.  Just the other day we were out grabbing food and the server was black and wouldn’t you know-  here comes the act again.  It’s all, “yo what’s good homie, lemme get dat sandwich wit da side salad N u kno I gotsta get sum dat… etc etc.” Anyways, I made a crack about it again going, “ah there it is again.”  He pressed me further this time telling me to explain what I mean.  This basically ended with him calling me racist and splitting on the lunch we had planned.  When the server came back and noticed he was gone I just nervously said that he had an emergency and cancelled his order.  I ate alone in silence which was awful.So, full transparency… AITA?EDIT:  So already a ton of feedback and it’s obvious ITA.  I asked for transparency and I got it.

	"body" : "I (27 m) refuse to agree to travel to my wife's (25f) parents for Christmas.I posted here once about 2 years ago and reddit tore me apart, but hopefully this time my perspective can be seen a little better since it's regarding a different type of issue.Anyway, my girl and I have always split Christmas with each of our families. One year we spend Christmas with my folk, the next with hers. You know the deal.The issue is that her parents live in a different province than we do. My family lives a couple hours drive, hers lives 4 hours plane ride. So she pretty much only sees them once every other year on account of how costly and time consuming it is to travel that far.We had a son a couple years ago and he's never spent a Christmas with my wife' family. My parents got a double Christmas with him because we traveled there last year for her sister's wedding so I wasn't really interested in traveling again for Christmas.Technically that makes this Christmas my parents turn again, but more so than that my wife is pregnant with our second child.She'll be 7 1/2 months along by the time the holidays roll around and because of that I said it wasn't smart for us to fly.We've been arguing about it on and off for weeks now and I've been getting mixed opinions from friends and family. My family agrees with me, a few friends have mixed opinions and her family thinks I'm being a completely 'selfish' (like looking out for my wife's health is selfish...)The arguments about this are escalating to her just pointing out or bringing up every example of me doing something she thinks is wrong.It's getting on my nerves because 1) the whole trip will be paid for on my dime so I should get a say in how I want to spend my pay cheques 2) not wanting to travel when she'll be that heavily pregnant has nothing to do with how many chores I do or how often I help with our kid 3) I'm literally just thinking about her and our new baby 4) If something happens and she gives birth over the holidays what are we meant to do? Spend a whole month extra out there??I'm getting so tired of these arguments I'm almost tempted to just say I'm not participating in Christmas at all this year. I won't obviously because my son deserves gifts and festivities and all. But the temptation is there.Anyway. Am I being the AH here by not agreeing to travel for Christmas or is she being the AH by trying to push something I'm uncomfortable with?[Edit] just seeing a lot of people asking for same bits of info.why can't her parents just travel to you? : they can if they want to. I'll even pay for it. But only her parents. She has multiple siblings who split holidays the same way we do. They've all arranged to spend Christmas with her parents this year. So if her parents want to miss the Christmas with them and spend it with us then I will accommodate that but her siblings, their spouses and their kids can either pay for themselves or change their plans.\"your dime??!!! Your paycheck?!!\" : Yeah a trip like this isn't cheap and spending so much money on a trip that may not even happen that heavily pregnant is a VALID concern. I'm a sole provider and it would ruin the holidays for me if I spent thousands of dollars just for something to happen right before or during Christmas.Thank you for sharing your thoughts and opinions, I'll think about all that I've read.",

	"title" : "AITA or is my friend the asshole for hating me because of my childhood abuse?",
	"body" : "I'm 14. She's 15.We're both abused. Emily only got a few slaps and punches from her MOTHER whenever she made mistakes, and I was the victim of my father getting drunk and verbally abusing me from ages 2-6. It has affected me greatly and I now have trust issues and anxiety and depression. She doesn't seem to be affected.We were close friends, and one day she confided in me about her abuse, so I did the same. I assumed then she would understand my day to day issues because she's abused too, so I started coming to her with my issues. I have trust issues, so it's a bit hard to convince me of something when i'm really sad...I always assume they're lying. And I told her that. She should respect it. It usually takes a few hours to calm me down and talk me out of suicide or self harm...but it should be worth it, yknow? A true friend would care. That's why when she doesn't reply to me I assume she hates me and I call her out on it. I don't want fake friends.I don't like bothering people with my emotions, yknow? So usually I just tell my friends I'm sad or upset when we're in the middle of an activity and I start feeling self-hatred because I fucked up somewhere. I just leave so they don't have to deal with me... and she cheers me up. That's why I feel really hurt when she doesn't even bother and doesn't follow up with me in a few minutes, and I let her know so she doesn't do it in the future.  One day she started CRYING instead, straight to her friend. He got really mad at me for NO REASON? And told me how I wasn't trying to improve myself even though I WAS TRYING. I can't help it, I have severe mental issues from my abuse and they should understand. I called her crying and told her he called me an ATTENTION W**** because he basically did and he reminded me of my father, yelling at me.  I needed her to reassure me and she FAILED ME. Instead, she told me **I HURT HER** for some reason and told me it was STRESSFUL and affecting her mental health NEGATIVELY to try to cheer me up so much \"when you just accuse me of lying instead and make me prove to you I'm your friend\". A good friend will SUPPORT their friend in ANY WAY THEY CAN. It shouldn't affect anyone negatively. I told her that she and him were reminding me of my father, and that I was hurt she didn't even understand how I felt even thought she should have because she's abused, too. NOT EVEN ENOUGH FOR ANY SYMPATHY. I told her that her saying that made me cut myself, and that her abuse obviously isn't as bad as mine cause she doesn't seem to have any problems with it and she's asian anyways and all asian parents are like that and she should suck it up and she called me abusive.We made up a few days later and she was really distant for some reason. She kept spending time with the guy who attacked me and because of my trust issues and because I recently had two other friends talk about me behind my back before I met her so obviously I would be suspicious. I asked her if she hated me, because she spent time with him instead of me and didn't invite me. She just said she thought I hated him and I DO, I told her I wouldve sucked it up and SHE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN. She stopped spending time with him as much once they got busy with school but she was still distant. I started worrying she was talking about me behind my back, and that she hated me, so i would ask her about it alot, I can't help it, my anxiety makes me worry about it alot, she shoulda just sucked it up and reassured me.Instead, she told me it was rude and told me that it hurt her??? She said it made her feel like I didn't trust her and that friendship was based in trust. I told her the truth, because I hate lies and I'd want people to tell ME the truth. I told her that I obviously didn't trust her, I don't trust anyone because of my abuse, you could put the most trustworthy person in front of me and I wouldn't trust them. She told me to find a therapist and I got a bit mad because she assumed I did nothing about my problems and I told her it was rude of her to assume I did nothing about my mental health and how I cut myself and tried to commit suicide a while ago and I can't even go to school so she SHOULDNT ASSUME THINGS ABOUT ME. She blocked me. BLOCKED ME! She didn't even talk things out like a normal person. She just blocked me without letting me respond or have a say and all she said was that she tried but she just \"can't\" and that I was bad for HER mental health and called me manipulative and claimed I \"flipped\" the situation. It hurt me alot, she was the onl;y person I could rely on to talk to my problems about. I asked my other friends crying if they thought I was manipulative and mean and abusive and someone that everyone hates and they said no so she was wrong. I cut myself.Last weekend I bumped into her by coincidence at the mall when she was out with friends and I begged her to give me a second chance and I even had my friend tell her how she made me cry and cut myself and that I was really sorry. I told her I missed her friendship and she said \"me too I guess.\" She finally agreed to give me a chance. We decided to discuss boundaries and she told me that as long as I didn't \"flip things or be manipulative\" then she'd be my friend.  I told her how she was mean because she blocked me without telling me why, making me cut and her friendship was toxic to me so i didn't want to be best friends anymore just someone I talked to about my problems and that I felt awful in a way I never wanted to feel when i was friends with her because she called me manipulative and because her girlfriend who was my other best friend before she ghosted me after me and Sally's first fight would always talk to me about her mental problems and threaten to cut herself and kill herself and I'd have to talk her out of it. I also told her my friends didn't think I was manipulative either so she was toxic and I'd appreciate if she didn't talk to me outside of group activities or when I needed her because even seeing her at that mall made me run to the bathroom and cut myself and cry while my friend talked to her. She was super nice at the time too and agreed. Sometimes she brought up some of my behaviour and I told her that I'm not perfect, because I'm not. Plus, it was really confusing to have her go \"I miss your friendship!\" to \"Don't talk to me about personal issues!\" and I told her that she was misleading me by doing so and to please stop. I told her since my friends dont find me manipulative and she did it was super toxic to me and that I understood if she wanted to continue believing it she didn't have to talk to me. We agreed we'd be casual friends who spent time together in groups and helped me with personal issues and nothing more, then parted ways at the mall.She got really mad at me later and gave me a list of BULLSHIT reasons cause I told her how upset I was when she didnt tell me why she blocked me. She called me manipulative and a hypocrite for telling her about her girlfriends toxic behaviour to me and told me that I shouldn't talk to her ever again. She didn't even let me reply. I found it really demeaning because some of the things she mentioned I can't help because of my abuse and my problems stemming from it and she told me that she has the same problems, she just doesn't tell anyone. I think she just said that to seek attention and make me feel bad. Who's in the wrong?",

Her family is white and rarely interact with black people so this enforces that it will be an uncomfortable experience for me.

She told me they do drink alcohol, so I drink 3-4 beers on the way to her house because #1. I’m nervous but #2. My fiancé said they drink, so I thought it would be fine. Well here is the dilemma…I didn’t eat that much before I started pre drinking, so the couple of beers hit me way harder than I was expecting. I showed up slightly buzzed but when I got there, they offered me some wine. I happily accept and start introducing myself to all of the different family members.

However things started to change once they moved in (October 2023) because our house only have 3 bedrooms and so my Son had to share with his step brother while his step sister have a room by herself. We told the kids that this is only temporary and after this school year ends we will move into a much bigger house.After my stepson moved in the room with my son, he has been displaying disrespectful behavior towards his stepmother and stepsiblings. He's often rude and hateful. If he is asked to do something my my wife he'll roll his eyes or ignore her and not do it. He has locked his stepbrother out of his room multiple times and doesn't open the door until I threaten to take his phone or games away. Yesterday he decided it would be nice to lock my wife and step siblings out of the house while I was away at work. (She forgot her keys in the house) My wife called me and I had to drive home and leave work just to unlock the door. To say I was furious was an understatement.I decided to take my sons electronics away including his phone. I told him he's not allowed to go anywhere other than to and from school until I say so. I told him he is going to apologize and he is going to mean it. I'll admit I didn't say it as nicely as I wrote it but I was just angry that I had to leave work for dumb reason.My son is upset and feels I'm being unfair. He said that he never wanted to have a new family and he's getting punished for it. He said that he can't believe I'll choose my fake family over him. I told him that that's not true and I love him with all my heart.I said that he's not allowed to treat his step siblings or my wife and Im sorry you don't but that's no reason to treat them like trash when they treat you with love and respect. I told him that his stepsiblings didn't ask for this family either and that him acting this way towards them was selfish and inconsiderate. He then told me he wish I was the once who died. When he said that my heart broke and I left his room. I've been crying myself to sleep lately because I feel like I failed as a father and that's not something I wanted to do. I tried talking to my son but all he never verbally answers me. The best I get is a nod. I talked to with his grandparents (My ex wife's parents) and they suggested family therapy and I think imma try to do that. I've talked to my wife I'm contemplating on moving houses earlier than anticipated.Edit: I'm going to apologize to my son for dismissing his feelings and apologize. I never intended on hurting my son. I will try to put me and him into therapy. I just assumed he was happy about the marriage because he seemed happy about having stepsiblings up until October. I understand I'm the asshole, I understand I'm not good person, and I understand I'm not a good father. I will do everything I can to show my Son I love him. Thanks for putting it all in perspective.Edit again: I decided the best thing I could do for me and my son would be to divorce my wife. I love her, but I love my son more. I will be talking to her tomorrow.Edit 3: I allowed my son to stay home today so we can talk and I took a day off of work. I apologized to my son for making him feel unloved and told him that I was blinded by love and was too invested in my feelings and didn't consider his. I explained to him that I loved him with all my heart and I never intended on hurting him. I explained that when His mother died I was completely heartbroken and when I met my current wife she remined me so much of her and that I fell in love. I told him I'm sorry that I hurt him and I don't want him to hate me. He apologized to me and told me that he saw mom in my current wife too and he said that he felt like I didn't love him as much anymore and felt that when His step brother moved in his room he felt like he was being replaced. This made me cry. I apologized again and told my son I'm sorry forcing him to be in a family he wasn't ready for. My son said he doesn't want me to divorce my wife but he would like it if they would move out. I told him that I'll let this move in our new house from the time being because they have no where else to go. He said okay. Now I'm waiting for my wife to get off of work so we can talk about them moving and the future of our relationship.Edit: My wife called my Son Spoiled and a Brat so I'm filing for divorce. I'm giving her 3 weeks to get out of my house. I'm letting her take the new house I BOUGHT until she can find a place on her own simply because her kids had nothing to do with this and I don't want them to be homeless. I didn't know she felt that way about my son. However, my son wasn't near when she said that. We talked to the kids and told them about the divorce. My step daughter seemed fine, but my step son got upset and said I'm abandoning him just like his father and he started crying. I told him I would still like to have a relationship with him and I still consider him my son it's just that me and his mom are divorcing. He told me to Shut the fuck up and leave him alone and now he's crying in his room. Now it's tense in the house and I might consider her leaving earlier. I never expected it to end up like this.",

I picked a fancy restaurant (one that requires reservations), and when she got home from work, I wished her a happy anniversary and told her not to eat anything, since we would have a giant feast.  She said that it had been a hectic day at work and that she needed to have something to tide her over, since she hadn't eaten lunch.  This was like a slap in the face to me.  I reminded her that I was paying a lot for this meal and that anything she was capable of preparing couldn't hold a candle to the restaurant's food.  She finally relented.At around 8:45 PM, I got my wife for our 9:15 dinner reservation, but she was lying down in bed.  She told me that she had taken some ibuprofen because she had a splitting headache due to hunger.  When we got in the car, she kept complaining to me and telling me that I should have let her eat with such late reservations.  I really couldn't believe the harsh treatment I was getting, especially after doing her a favor and taking her somewhere really nice.  We rarely eat out because we live in a high-cost-of-living area, and my wife almost always milks me dry by ordering things like appetizers, cocktails, and expensive desserts.When we finally arrived at the restaurant, our waitress asked us how we were doing.  I smiled at her and said that I was doing well but joked that my wife was being a real grumpy-puss.  We both laughed, but my wife scowled at me.  I was only trying to make light of a bad situation, but my wife had chosen to get mad at me.  When my wife had finally eaten, she didn't seem to be in any better of a mood, and my original plan (for us to see The Marvels) was rejected by her.

	"body" : "Hello AITA community, I'm in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some outside perspective. My fiancé and I usually don't have major disagreements, but this incident has left us both upset and I'm not sure if I was in the wrong.For as long as I've known him, my fiancé has had this pair of boots. They're old, really old. He's had them for ages and wears them everywhere – and I mean everywhere, from hiking trails to formal events. I've always found it a bit odd, especially at events where everyone else is dressed up or at least shows some kind of thoughtfulness to their appearance. He insists that they're high-quality boots, the kind that can be rebuilt over and over, and he's quite attached to them. He often talks about how much money he spent on them years ago and how they're meant to look aged and rugged.The thing is, to me, they just look... terrible. They're scuffed, discolored, and honestly a bit embarrassing in certain settings. So, I made a decision that I thought would be a nice surprise. I threw out the old boots and bought him a new pair, a sleek and stylish one that I thought would be more appropriate for a range of occasions. Mind you, he's only mentioned this once about the quality and how he can essentially re-use them or something like that. But he's also very frugal so I thought he just felt guilty spending which is why I decided to just step in and help him out.Well, the surprise didn't go as planned. When he found out, he was livid. He said that those old boots were special to him, that they looked as they should, etc. He accused me of not understanding the worth of well-made, lasting items. He's also quite upset about the new boots I bought, calling them \"cheap looking mall boots\" and saying they're nowhere near the quality of his old ones. I also accused him of not reading the room and noticing when his shoes are CLEARLY not appropriate and standout in the worst way possible.I feel terrible. I genuinely thought I was doing something nice for him, updating his wardrobe a bit and saving him the embarrassment of wearing those rugged old boots to nice places. But now I wonder if I've completely disregarded his feelings and attachment to those boots.So, AITA here? Was I wrong to throw away his old crusty boots and replace them with something I thought was better? I thought I was being thoughtful, but his reaction has made me doubt my actions.EDIT: It's clear the consensus is IATA. I spoke to my fiance again it is only now that he told me they were a pair of boots that were custom made to his feet sizing. I looked up the company and the prices are so absurd I almost cried. I asked him why he never ever brought up that he had a custom pair of boots! I imagine no one has something like that or at least very few people that it's something worth mentioning! I just have to admit I was wrong and that's it, I cannot even come close to affording a new pair of those same boots for him.",

Technically, I could choose to work fewer hours, but it would affect my performance and delay advancement in my career. As the sole breadwinner, I feel like it's my responsibility to earn as much as I possibly can.This week my wife has been sick. I didn't see a lot of her as I've been coming in late and leaving early. Last night I worked through the night at my office (I have a couch and did sleep for a short time there) because I had a lot to get done, and it's a lengthy commute from work to home. She knew I was going to do this, it happens every month or two. She normally doesn't mind, though she did sound annoyed on the phone yesterday when she told me she and our youngest were feeling terrible.I came home around 4 this afternoon to find she had no plans for dinner, had done very little cleaning, and had not met up with our elderly neighbor Lucy, who's been needing help with a project in her house. I expressed that I was bummed she hadn't been able to help the neighbor, because Lucy can't complete the project on her own. That's when my wife lost her ever loving shit on me.She said of course she's gone nowhere near Lucy, because she is sick, and it's common courtesy to try not to spread germs to old people. I thought it sounded like a copout because my wife didn't seem all that sick to me BUT I didn't say that to her. She said I had some nerve asking what was for dinner after being gone for two days leaving her to do everything for the kids while she was feeling awful. You guys... the kids are 7+. It's not like she's changing their diapers and spoon feeding them.She actually said it 'must be nice' to make choices like I did last night, to stay over at the office, to order doordash and sleep on the pullout there like 'someone with no responsibilities.' She said she would have loved a little peace and quiet to recuperate from her illness, and I should thank her for being here to do what she does so I could do what I did. Okay, but it's not like I was at a damn hockey game or the strip club. I was working. She should thank me for doing that so she can be home while she's sick instead of dealing with a boss and racing to meet deadlines.I told her I'm not going to thank her for doing the bare minimum shit she should be doing, and I don't expect her to thank me for supporting us financially.

I have been at my current job for about a month now and obviously I want to impress. Last night, my boss asked me to stay late to help finish up a portion of a project.

I said of course, but why would she be willing to throw away our relationship over holes in her body? If she got them that means she didn't love me enough to be scared of losing a relationship.I mentioned this to my oldest daughter (26F) who lives with me. She said that her sister had contacted her a few days before in a panic over how I would react. I asked my eldest daughter why my youngest would be willing to throw away a relationship with me after everything we've been through, but also why my youngest would think I could ever stop loving her.My eldest paused, and looked at me with I guess bewilderment and said it's because I said I would disown her. I told her I just said that to scare my youngest because as a parent, it's my job to discourage her from doing stupid things. Find me a parent who doesn't talk like that to their kids, and at least others' kids listen. My eldest rolled her eyes and said we aren't other people. I told her I'm a human being and I have the right to be angry and have boundaries. She said as a parent I have the obligation to model healthy communication instead of manipulation.

My eldest stared at me for a long time, and then just laughed and said that explained a lot about me. She said babies \"manipulating\" (she used air quotes) their parents because they have no form of emotional regulation isn't the same as a parent manipulating their child with threats and lies and being surprised that their children start to be afraid of their parents. She's always bringing up this weak western parenting stuff and she's always twisting things in her head because she's sensitive and vindictive towards me for perceived slights I've made towards her.My eldest said \"Why did you ask me if I know nothing? Right before you brought this up you said you were reflecting on how it is that your children can both care for you and resent you.\" And I told her they're adults now so I don't care how they live their lives. She said \"Obviously you do otherwise you wouldn't be saying things like we're disrespecting you and trying to end the relationship by doing things that don't even concern you.\" She then got up, said goodnight and went to bed.Usually my eldest is mature enough to sit through a conversation like an adult, even if she gets emotional.

However, Luke and my friends bf (Ben) are best friends and workmates, and they used to live together before Ben moved in with his gf, so they're extremely close. Apparently close enough for Ben to suggest naming his son after him.My friend knows our relationship didn't end well, so I was pretty hurt when I found out she was honouring him by naming her son after him. She told me that Luca was a name she'd loved forever, and that Luke is someone who is a really important part of Ben's life so the name just made sense. I don't understand why they couldn't honour any other male in either of their lives, such as their fathers or brothers, or even just use Luca as a middle name, but I can't change their opinions so whatever.I don't want to be reminded of my ex every time I see my friend's baby, so instead I decide to call him Jamie whenever I'm playing with him, from his middle name, James. I even made him a blanket embroided with that nickname. I don't see a problem, because I think it's perfectly normal for people to have nicknames that are only used by one person. Even for myself, my uncle has his own nickname for me that no one else uses. But my friend got upset when she saw the blanket and heard me addressing him by that name, saying it was childish and disrespectful and it was erasing part of her son's identity.I asked her what she expected from me after naming her son after my ex, and she told me that I was being self-centred and that just because I had a bad relationship with Luke, doesn't mean she or Ben did, so I can't expect her to take into account my feelings with everything related to her son.I think that not naming her son after a person who I just ended a long term relationship with is not a farfetched request at all, and her violating that request is just an invitation for me to address her son by whatever nickname I choose.Also it's worth noting that Me and Luke where together before her and Ben were, so it's not like she had known Luke for a long period of time or had any sort of relationship or interactions with him before I started dating him.So AITA?",

If a 17yo can't follow simple directions then they need to be confined and I'm not getting sick because my 7yo doesn't wash his hands especially after using the urinal. He said that it wasn't the right time and I said it needs to be addressed when it happens.No, I don't like grounding my kids especially since he's going to be a senior in high school.

Later she told me that I offended her and she didn't appreciate me belittling her and wanted me to treat her as equal.  I said fine, lets roll baby.  We rolled and I crushed her and submitted her.  She got mad saying I was using my weight and no skill.  I told her \"hey baby, you can't have your cake and eat it too\".

She wanted to come at 5pm, but I told her not to arrive before 6pm as I am exhausted from work and wanted to have a nap before she arrived.To my surprise, I heard the door knock at 5pm, when I was just getting into bed. She said that had caught the early bus, as she was planning on walking in the forest reserve near my house, and then come at 6pm. It started to thunderstorm, so she ran over to my house so she could have some shelter and asked if she could just stay on the lounge while I slept.I was furious that she didn’t show any respect to the boundaries. As far as I’m concerned, she should never have taken the early bus especially when the forecast was for rain. I feel like she did this on purpose because her original request was to arrive at 5pm.I told her no, she cannot come in until 6pm which is what we agreed and closed the door. I took the nap and when my alarm went off at 6, she wasn’t here and she had left a bunch of angry text messages. She said I was being ridiculous to say I haven’t respected her boundaries, and she only came early because it started pouring with rain. She said she was forced to walk to the bus stop in the storm and go home. I told her this was what she got for making a choice to arrive early and that personal boundaries are not there for the taking. I am not responsible for the consequences she suffered. She has now uninvited me from Christmas and says she wants distance in our relationship.So AITA for simply holding firm to my personal boundaries? I think she should never have put me in this positionEDIT - this is my only edit, but since it has been asked, my sister continually arrives early to any plans we make thereby disregarding my wishes and disrespecting me and the boundaries I set (she even arrived early once when I told her I was going to be with my BF before he flew interstate and it was our last day together and she came and interrupted).

Even if I could they are very popular and I would not be able to snag a commission slot anyway.So I’ve been spending a long time to track down an artist who is much less popular, cheaper but has the skills to pull off the others style. I finally found one after so long, so I contacted them for a commission. I showed them my character and explained my whole situation. Basically that I need them to change aspects of their style to look like the other artist, that way I can basically get art from the other artist I want but not really. I showed them various examples so they could get a good feel for it. Suddenly they were very offended at my request and refused my commission. They said it’s rude af to ask them to change their style and I should commission people for their own style only.. I don’t understand at all. In my opinion they should feel honored that I believe they are good enough to pull of a style similar to a very talented and popular artist. It shows they have the talent. But now I get why they are not popular it’s because they get offended so easily.Unfortunately this situation did not end there like I thought. As much as I hated to I  was simply going to look for another artist.  But I found out that the one I contacted for a commission, not only did they block me but they warned the other artist (with the style I was asking for) and they made a post telling people not to do what I did just because they were too expensive. Uh, I’m sorry I can’t afford your expensive af art? And I guess that means I NEVER get to have your art style just because I’m poor. I honestly don’t respect them as much as I used to.

	"title" : "AITA for refusing to throw an extra party?",
	"body" : "My son J (M25) is engaged to a woman D (F24/25). In D’s culture it’s traditional for the mother-in-law (me) to throw a party for the bride. J said to me that he’d really appreciate it if I did so and it would “make D feel like part of the family”. The issue I have with this is threefold. First of all, D’s mother is already throwing her a bridal shower. Throwing her a second one would just be repetitive. Second of all, J and I are not even part of D’s culture, and I wouldn’t feel comfortable taking part in activities like that for risk of offending or appropriating her culture. Third of all, and this is where I fear I’ll come across as an asshole, D isn’t part of the family, not until she and my son are wed. So it feels wrong to me to celebrate her as a family member when, let’s be honest, she isn’t.I laid this all out to J, who had basically no reaction at first. He just sat and listened for my reasons. Afterwards he shrugged and went “alright then”. This conversation happened a couple weeks ago, and since then he’s been avoiding me. Even when we talk things are stiff. I figured he was upset about something I said during that talk so we talked about it last night. I asked him how he felt about what I said and whether I upset him. I’m paraphrasing he essentially said that he wasn’t surprised, but just disappointed.He said that he wasn’t surprised because my husband and I never threw him parties, we never celebrated his achievements or anything and it was disappointing to hear that that extended to D as well. I was kind of struck dumb by this because yes, my husband and I are not celebratory people by nature, but we always showed him to the best of our ability that we loved him. To that end I said I’d be willing to compromise in a way, and said that after the wedding and their honeymoon I’d love to take D out to lunch or dinner with my friends and just get some girl time with her.He was very upset by now and said that that wasn’t what this is about and stormed off.

So here’s the situation I had a favorite teacher Mrs. K and I thought she was nice teacher but one day when me and my partner had to go to class since the bell rang for 3rd period after nutrition break, we hugged as always and suddenly Mrs. K yells, “NO HUGGING, NO HOLDING HANDS, OR KISSING NEXT TIME I’LL SAY IT LOUDER!” Me and my partner were red in the face and immediately went to class also this was in public. During 6th period I had her and I asked to use the restroom but she then stops me and tells me that it was inappropriate to do those things SHE DIDN’T EVEN APOLOGIZE. I just nodded and went to the bathroom. I ended breaking down in tears because I had just gotten embarrassed by my favorite teacher.

You just embarrassed me in front of a bunch of kids! You handled this very inappropriately and you didn’t apologize. Your such an idiot for thinking this was okay for you to do that!“ my teacher told me to go back to my seat and said she’ll talk to me later about my behavior. When the bell rang I ran out as fast as possible. I told my partner and he’s on my side and apparently the teacher called his mom saying he was “bothering”(if you get what I mean) other students.

My grandmother (83F) asked me about it recently on a call and when I said I didn't get in she kept talking about next time I pay and all that bull. I told her there was no next time, what are the odds of me getting in then if I didn't now. She told me some bs about getting experience, generic stuff.Then she told me this story. Apparently she had always wanted to be a doctor as a kid, and even though her father didn't accept women in university, she still wanted to go ahead with it. She said she did super well in school, but in those days all students in the province took exams at the same time and they were worth your entire mark.Anyway, she had her period and apparently had really bad cramps or felt sick or something and her doctor wouldn't give her a note bc it was due to her period. She barely passed her exams and had her acceptance revoked. She applied to physio school the next cycle (pun not intended hahaha) and didn't get in either. She went to the university office and sat there until the guy apparently gave in and so she became a physiotherapist.Anyway, I told her that she didn't not get into medical school because of period cramps, and she didn't even take her own advice and reapply to medical school! It sounded like she was just trying to make me think about all ways she succeeded and I didn't so I got mad and hung up the phone.I don't think I'm the asshole because I was already in a bad mood and her bragging about her accomplishments was obviously not going to help my situation.EDIT: I'm not a misogynist, and I do understand how bad period cramps can be. I'm just saying there's no way to know how bad hers were, because there wasn't a doctor's note or anything.

Yet she still goes to work without issue and seems fine even on the days she works from home. Once she is done with work though, she will say she is in pain and cannot cook and order takeout or make shortcut meals. She will refuse to do things and just lay down even things like going for a walk and going to see my friends, yet sometimes she still sees hers. This does not actually bother me that much but the fact that she keeps talking about her period all the time gets annoying.She has seen multiple doctors and they all said she is fine and just told her to use some painkillers which she does and she is on top of all her health appointments.The reason I think she is exaggerating it is she seems completely fine when friends are around, or if we are at her or my parents places. She seems to be in a great mood on her work calls then after work complains about having to work while on her period. I know there is probably some mild to moderate feeling of your body being different but none of my exes complained this much, and I grew up with 2 sisters and nor did they. Some of them even did sports while on their period.I finally told her that I understand it is uncomfortable but she should not make the whole day and everything about her period for attention and she got mad at me and called me an AH. I did not mean it in a way to belittle her, I just thought she should learn to deal with it better.EDIT: Ok maybe I should have phrased it better and been less accusatory towards her. I do understand she might be uncomfortable but I guess my problem was more that I did not like that it becomes the only thing she talks about when she is on it.

I get on really well with her brother (M43) who we visited on Saturday of this weekend just gone.While enjoying catching up, the topic of conversation got onto pets and when my wife and I were going to look at obtaining any as our kids would enjoy the presence of and benefit from bonding and looking after them.Our property is not the best for dogs or cats, so we were discussing the option of fish (yes, we could get a dog or a cat and there are numerous other pets we could consider, I am simply depicting the conversation flow). This is where things turned amusing, as my wife is a vegetarian and has been since she was four years old, whereas I am not. This has created some \"interesting\" situations between us historically, but this one at my BIL's was the most entertaining by far!My wife, quite seriously, stated to me that I will never be able to cook or eat fish in our house ever again if we kept them as pets. Me thinking there would be some ironic/hypocritical logic behind her statement asked her to confirm her reasoning, which she stated very passionately was actually that it would be cruel to do so where our fishy pets could smell the fish being cooked and see me eating them. At that moment, quite taken aback by what my wife had just depicted, my BIL and I caught each other's eye and proceeded to wet ourselves laughing.Clearly having gone over my wife's head as to why we were in such fits of laughter, my BIL and I started to depict some of the differences between gasses and liquids, as well as the intelligence levels and emotional consciousness of fish... but kept laughing too much, both at my wife's annoyance at us as well as our laughter perpetuating each other.Numerous references were made between us two for the rest of the afternoon, including designing solutions to catch and condense the steam produced when cooking any fish to then add to the fish tank's water in order to experiment with how our fishy pets would react. We again found this highly amusing (no doubt you would would needed to have been there to have laughed about it as much as we did), but my wife did not.My wife was, and still is today, very annoyed by us laughing at her expense having realised that her scientific logic was not prevailing at that moment in time. With further silly statements, ideas and GIFS shared within our family WhatsApp group, I am still firmly in the doghouse.I get that our reactions might have been a little over the top and we may have taken it a bit too far, but considering how funny my BIL and I found it, can I not enjoy myself a little at my wife's expense rather than being subjected to her being clearly disgruntled with my behaviour.

She ended up moving across country for a promotion (her company wanted to keep her employed so they offered her a better job). She was happier but was having trouble with childcare and was working less hours. A couple months into her new job, she vented to me that her older workers were criticizing her constantly and she wasn't sure if she was doing things right or not. She dropped off the face of the earth and it wasn't until a few days later we found out she had a meltdown and was admitted to a psychward. Our mom drove down to check on her and help get her out of the facility(they wouldn't let her go) She quit thr company for good because the previous supervisor started spreading rumors about her meltdown and that her coworkers had cornered her and told her to quit because she was 'mentally uncapable.' She moved to a different state where her bf's family was. She flew back a month later to attend our younger sisters graduation and turn in the rest of her stuff to her previous employer.

Lately, our family have been missing her son and asked her when is she bringing him down. (She didn't bring him for the graduation because he didnt like flying and she would be alone with him, i sent her videos on how to occupy a baby on a plane) she said when she gets job she'll start working on a visit and that her previous employer won't give her cashed out leave.

	"body" : "context: I am a stay at home dad and my wife works full time with a very high paying job (7 figures).Despite our current high income, my wife came from a lower class background and doesn't like to unnecessarily splurge on ourselves unless it's for our kids. Before the most recent argument, there have been a few other incidents in the past few months where we disagreed on gifts/donations. To be fair to her, she might be particular on edge because she found out there have been a few cases where I've been donating/gifting money without her knowledge to the tune of a few thousand dollars. Even though most of the time I always ask her beforehand.Recently, an acquaintance passed away and I would like to donate some money and buy some books for their son. I believe the donation will mean a lot to him and is a trivial amount of money to us. However, my wife disagrees. She asked me how much the book costs and I said $13. Then she said \"why don't you just donate $13 then, why do you need $200?\". Long story short, I think she is heartless, she thinks I am wasteful.In general, I dislike how I have to get her \"approval\" to donate money, makes me feel like I have no agency at all financially. When we got married, I gave up my job as a SWE in the bay area to start the family. If I kept my career, I think I would be making at least 200k-300k. But now, even though we never have to worry about our everyday expenses, I feel like I don't have enough discretionary spending. She thinks this is not financial abuse because if she wants to spend nontrivial amounts of money, she would ask me too, so the situation is symmetric.Am I actually the asshole? Or am I under financial abuse?",

	"title" : "AITA for confronting my roommate?",
	"body" : "So I 23f have a roommate, Gwen 19f, and we share an apartment. Gwen works night shifts at CVS, from 10pm to 6am. She typically gets home around 6:30am. On days I work, I have to get up at 7am. I have a really bad issue of sleeping through alarms, so she gets me up at 7 on days I work so that I don't oversleep. I don't set my alarm anymore because she works Tuesday-Saturday and I work Wednesday-Saturday, so she's always available to get me up at 7am. She knows I don't set an alarm.Anyway, a few days ago she did not wake me up and I ended up sleeping in until 8am. I was extremely late to work because of this and got in trouble with my boss because of it. I was super pissed about this so I confronted her about this when I got home. She told me that her shift relief called out so she had to stay until noon and was not able to go home. I told her she could have at least called me to try to wake me up. She just kept making excuses about how she couldn't make phone calls at work, even though she could have just went to the bathroom. When I tried to explain this to her, she claimed I am \"ungrateful\" for her waking me up and said she won't do it anymore. I called her immature for trying to avoid her responsibility and she called me self centered. I went to my room because I was tired of the disrespectful things she was calling me.The next morning, she was gone again when I got up for work and texted me saying she wouldn't be back until late morning because she and her brother went out to eat breakfast after she got off work. This really upset me because it felt like she was throwing in my face her lack of responsibility, so I didn't respond. When I got off work and came home I told her she is being petty and that she could at least be civil since she wants to avoid her responsibilities. She called me a horrible roommate and told me that she can't tolerate living with me anymore. We started arguing, she ended up leaving the apartment crying, and now she won't answer any of my texts or calls. I know I may have said some rude things in the heat of the moment, but I felt really disrespected by her actions and was trying to communicate that. AITA?",

We were playing the north and so I put my music compilation on for that moment. It was playing battle gym of the old Republic I think. A camp counselor told us to turn the music off as it was offensive. I asked her how and she says it's too nationalistic.I told her that is the dumbest shit I've ever heard and she told me to stop talking back. I got really pissed and I told her to fuck off and if she really thought patriotic music was offensive, then she probably doesn't like this country and if that's the case she should leave, there's plenty of hard working foreigners who'd love this country and would do anything to take her place.She brought the head counselor over and they told us to hand laptops over. We refused so they threatened to kick us out of the camp, I still refused. when my mom picked us up they said we were no longer welcome.My mom is fucking pissed for us getting kicked out, my dad however said he's proud of me.Edit: this was the after care after the program ended, we were chilling inside the rec hall, plenty of space, plenty of people had music playing volume wasn't the issue, it's just that counselor was offended by the song",

Her parents couldn’t afford some kind of boarding school for kids like her so we thought the next best thing was for her to live with me. I’m much more strict than her parents, she already hates me and my family, and she’ll be 15 hours away from all of her friends and family.Ella has very strict rules while she’s here. She has a flip phone that can contact me, my wife, and a couple other family members and an iPad with parental controls, so she can’t text her friends or access social media. She is not allowed to go out with her friends after school or on weekends and she can’t go to their houses. Her friends can come here as long as she’s doing well in school, she’s behaving at school and at home, and she’s doing her chores and there has to be an adult in the house with them. She has to go to therapy twice a week and is not on medication yet but it is being considered.Because of what she did, I absolutely do not spoil her. She gets the bare minimum that I have to provide. She has 5 tee shirts, 2 pairs of pants, one pair of shoes, a pack of socks, a pack of underwear, and 2 bras. All of it was bought from thrift stores or something like the Ross clearance section. It’s time to start buying warmer clothes so I went back to goodwill and buy nothing and she now has a couple long sleeve shirts, 2 sweaters, a medium weight jacket, and a heavyweight jacket and a pair of boots. She absolutely hates all of her clothes and has been throwing more tantrums about it than usual lately.Lately she’s been saying it’s not fair that my kids get to get whatever they want and get to shop at name brand stores but most of her clothes were used. I tell her that’s what she gets for doing whatever she did to end up here and it usually shuts her up but not yesterday.I finally snapped at her and told her that all she deserves is the absolute bare minimum and that that’s all that I’m willing to provide for her. It doesn’t matter what I could afford, what her parents can afford, or what I get my kids. She’s getting exactly what she deserves, if not more than what she deserves. I told her that if she complains about what I provide for her again, I will make sure she is sent somewhere worse than here and she could see how good she has it.She told her mom about it and her mom (who knows what happened but doesn’t think it’s a big deal)/her mom’s side of the family (who don’t know what happened) have been blasting me for treating her this way and want to send her everything that I “deprive” her of (a real phone, nice clothes, etc).AITA for not getting her any more than the bare necessities?",

	"body" : "English is not my first language, apologies for any typos.I (30F) recently moved to a new city with my 30 pound female Staffordshire bull terrier, Sky. Last night I took Sky to the park near our new home so she could run around. Sky is playful and loves making new friends but she is a big girl and can be intimidating to those not familiar with dogs so she is well-trained and obedient and comes when I call her name.There were not many people in the park last night, so I let Sky off her leash. As I said, she's a very obedient dog, so I have never had any issues before. I guess she got a bit too excited to be in a new place so she ran away and would not come back when I called her. I had to chase her quite a long way.When I caught up with her and leashed her, a man who was sitting on a bench with two small girls (maybe 4 and 6?) asked me if I was the owner. I said yes. He told me that Sky should have a leash and muzzle as she is a restricted breed and that she ran into one of his daughters, nearly knocking her over. I told him that Sky is very sweet and playful and would not have hurt his child intentionally. He said he's sure I'm right and that he grew up around pitbulls, but that I still need to respect the law and the fact that not everybody likes dogs. He said his daughter was fine and is used to dogs, but another parent might be very angry about this.I felt like he was being condescending to me, so I asked him why his daughter was not being adequately supervised. He told me that his daughters were playing just a few feet from him and Sky came around the corner so fast that nobody had time to react. He reiterated that his daughter was okay, but that I still needed to obey the law.I still think that if he was supervising his kids properly, this wouldn't have happened. Why am I being blamed for his lack of parenting skills. I don't see why I should have to muzzle my dog just because parents are lazy",

H is a very feminine guy, and he's got really pretty, long hair and looks a bit doll-like, so I always like to tease him for that (although that's not the main point of this post).Every time somebody compliments H, like when his coworker tells him \"good job\", he sort of gushes and acts really adorably, like a little kid who is being praised by his parents. This is something I've always made fun of him for, both before and after we became a couple. Last year, H got a little bit fed up with this teasing, and he told me that it's really getting on his nerves. I've stopped with this teasing immediately when he voiced discomfort about it last year, but I have noticed a change in how he receives positive feedback. Rather than acting like his usual adorable, childlike self whenever somebody praises him, he just kind of looks to the ground and says \"thanks\" quietly and that's it. In general, he's become noticeably sullen over the past year, and I feel like he needs to lighten up.",

Dan and Adam got the master bedroom and they share it. The room is L-shaped and allows them to have their privacy. Greg and I have the room opposite them on the first floor, while Ava sleeps downstairs in the smallest room.Adam has grown to 6 ft now and plays on the school basketball team. Last week, Adam sprained his ankle badly while playing and can't walk upstairs to his room. Temporarily, I asked Ava to swap beds with Adam, so Adam can sleep downstairs instead. She wasn't happy at all, as she said she didn't want to share a room with Dan and that the boys room always smells bad. However, for the last few nights she has stayed in Dan's room.Adam has been in a bad mood since the sprain, as he will not be able to play basketball for a while and has been going physical therapy, with very little progress right now. Yesterday, Adam snapped at Ava after she teased him over something and they hadn't spoken to each other since.At around 2AM last night, Ava woke up Adam and asked him to sleep on the couch in the living room as she wanted her room back. The couch is not long enough for Adam to sleep on, and it is not comfortable for me, and I am 5'4. They were yelling loudly and I woke up and came downstairs to see them fighting. I yelled at Ava and told her to stop being insensitive to Adam and that he is currently injured. I took Ava's phone away, grounded her, and told her she will not get the phone back until the end of the week.Greg works the night shift, so wasn't there during any of this. This evening, he said I was harsh towards Ava, and I am overstepping my boundaries as his girlfriend to parent Ava. Normally, we don't parent each other's kids, but I felt last night was an exception.Ava is upset I have taken her phone away, and wants it back, as she is planning on going out with her friends on Friday. She will need her phone for her bus pass and I have refused to give it back, despite Greg saying one day is enough and he wants me to give Ava back her phone now. He said Ava is making a sacrifice by giving up her room for Adam as is, and to be more empathetic to her.eta- I would like to clarify Ava was offered an air mattress downstairs in the living room or Adam's bed upstairs by Greg and I. She picked sleeping upstairs as the living room downstairs is right next to the door and greg gets home at 5AM. She is a light sleeper so gets easily disturbed.",

I wouldn't have minded being a stay-at-home dad but I have a better salary and we couldn't live on my wife's income.Even if I work I’m a super helpful dad and partner in general : I almost do every errance, I book appointments, I take care of my daughter in the morning before dropping her off at daycare, etc… and since the birth of our son I also do 50% of the bottles during the night.While my wife takes care of the cooking, laundry, dishes, sterilizing baby bottles, some errance, and the baby during the day.3 days ago we were at a friends apartment one evening with our children for a little gathering (2 couples + us). During the evening my wife took care of our newborn and I was responsible for watching our daughter. You should know that our friend’s apartment is on the second floor without elevator.And when it was time to leave, I took our daughter in my arms and I thought that my wife would take care of carrying our son in his stroller carrycot. But instead, she collected all the bags, and our daughter's stroller. And she asked if someone could help us and come down with our son and his stroller carrycot (which I admit is heavy but not impossible for my wife to carry). I didn't want to leave responsibility for my son on the stairs to someone else so I told my wife to drop everything and take the stroller carrycot.At first she did it but then she sees my daughter in one of our friend arms et she assume he will be the one coming down with us, and I will be the one carrying our son. So she collected once again all the bags and the stroller.But finally my daughter came back into my arms not wanting to go down with anyone else and that's when my wife disrespected me. I told her once again to stop with the bags and to take care of our son, she looked at me angry at the situation and told me : “You are really annoying me right now, someone else could pick the stroller carrycot with our son”.I did not at all appreciate the tone of his voice (which was really aggressive) and his attitude in front of our friends. At the end a friend or ours took the bags and my wife took our son.That night I decided not to help with nighttime bottles for our son because my wife had taken a nap with our son during the day.And in the morning, she expected a « Thank you » for doing the night alone and I told her she would not have it until she apologized for her behaviour yesterday. I also decided that I would no longer help at all at night and that the rest of the time I would do the bare minimum, until my wife apologized.

So I asked for an extension and gave the professor our work distribution chart letting her see if we are doing unequal tasks and she can decide on whether Katie is getting a deduction or not.Trigger Point. Constant procrastinationThe presentation was supposed to be done two weeks prior as I urged her finish so we have time to practice, but she never bothered to care. She was hospitalized 2 days before the presentation and then told me I should do the presentation all by myself. And she is not going to work on the captions. If I were not sick, I'll actually let her get the same score as I, caused I'm used to my teammates not doing anything and this is actually the first time I ever pointed it out.Followup? I'm in ER, she finally agrees to do it. Considering to tell professor we sorted it out and get equal points.But I just contacted Katie a few minutes earlier and (after telling I'm in the ER, she is either gonna get both of us a 0 or she gotta do it) she said she can take over the captions part, so I'm considering to ask the professor give us equal scores now.",

	"title" : "AITA for asking my boyfriend to get rid of his dog?",
	"body" : "I’m a 24f, my boyfriend is 26m. We live in Maine and have been together for about a year and we’re looking to move in together next year. We’re both originally from Massachusetts, I moved to Maine for nursing school 7 years ago and he moved up here for work about 5 years ago, but we both always planned to move out of Maine eventually. In fact, I had told him when we first got together that I wanted to move within a year, I was just staying to get more experience for my career. Now, I’m working as a nurse with plans to go back to grad school next fall and he works as a superintendent of a golf course in the area. My lease is up in April and I don’t want to renew, I want to move out of Maine, closer to where I’m planning to go to grad school and I want him to come with me since he was also planning on leaving Maine in a couple years anyways. He wants that too but he also says he needs to stay for another golf season (at least until the end of next November) or else he’ll take a huge hit in his career progression. My issue with moving next November is that I’ve really grown to hate this area and so badly and I want to go explore a new city and start a new chapter of my life plus I don’t know if I could have my lease extended until then. We’ve talked about compromises like if he comes with me in April I’m willing to move to a place that he likes more and stay for longer or if I wait and move with his timeline in November he’s willing to go to a place I prefer. Moving separately and being long-distance for 6/7 months isn’t really an option for us. Another piece of this is that I have a cat and he has a dog and they’re not the best together. I got my cat a couple years ago after wanting one for a really long time, and I love him with all my heart. His dog technically belongs to the golf course and was originally bought to work as a “goose-dog” and he was tasked with taking care of her while he works for them. He’s grown to care about her and she’s pretty well behaved and everything but he didn’t specifically intend on having a dog and I’m not a huge dog person. Additionally, the animals don’t get along the best..his dog scares and stresses out my cat and I’m worried that if we lived together it would make my cat miserable and that would break my heart, plus I really don’t want to live with a dog. I’ve been thinking about saying yes to his compromise and staying longer with him to leave in November because I love him and want this to workout, but in exchange I don’t want to live with a dog or worry about the animals not getting along. Am I the asshole if I ask him not to bring the dog?TLDR: am I the asshole for not wanting my boyfriend to bring his work-dog when we move out of state in exchange for pushing back my timeline to be with him?",

	"body" : "My sister (22F) is 6 months pregnant. She stays home, and my BIL (24M) works. He's been coming home from work late recently, she says he's taking on more work these days because money is tight. According to my sister, he used to do a few chores around the house, and shop with her for groceries every weekend, but since he started working for longer hours, 14 daily I think, he doesn't seem to be doing much around the house. She says \"he's barely at home for 2 hours aside from when he's sleeping, what do you want him to do?\"    The situation until he changed hours was my sister cooks for them everyday and basically does everything like the dishes, laundry, vacuumming, etc.  He picks up on laundry, but as far as I know, I don't think he does much else around the house. I'm not sure if he does anything at all. They went to the doctor last weekend, who said my sister shouldn't be physically straining herself. She was on the phone with me that day, and she was elated he'd \"cooked them lunch even though he can't cook!\" and \"he was insisting I needed to rest, even though cooking is an everyday activity and it's no trouble at all\" .I'd invited them for dinner last night. We ended up talking about chores, and my BIL said he tries vaccuuming  in the morning if he doesn't have to be in early, does the laundry before or after work, usually does the dishes after dinner if he has dinner with her, otherwise he asks her to leave them dirt so he can do them once he's home, and buys them dinner once in a while so she doesn't have to cook, and he goes grocery shopping with her every weekend. But he doesn't manage to vacuum everyday because it's too early when he wake up and too late when he gets back, so my sister has to do the vacuuming frequently, laundry if he hasn't done it, and the dishes if he's extra late or \"she just doesn't want to bother him with it\", as she says. So I told him he's a useless husband, my husband does way more than him and I'm not even pregnant. He said he's \"trying his best\", \" but there's not much he can do if he's home for 2 or 3 hours when he's not sleeping\", etc. I said he doesn't seem to be, if he's letting my pregnant sister vacuum. I said he must have learnt that from his father because he seemed to be out of town for work all the time and didn't help his wife with much around the house as long as he was alive (4years ago).  My BIL was quiet the rest of the dinner and didn't say a word. My sister said I was out of line and I should apologize. I didn't, because I was simply being honest, and standing up for her, but she clearly doesn't seem to think so. She told her her husband he's doing more than enough and she said that I don't need to give my opinions on her marriage. They left soon after, with my sister glaring at me. I still don't get why she was upset, because I said stuff about her husband, not her.So, AITA ?",

	"body" : "For a bit of backstory, I ( 24 F) moved from Vietnam to Canada when I was really young along with my brother ( 26 M), we lived with our aunt in Canada. Our aunt does not speak a lot of Vietnamese so me and my brother eventually became less and less fluent.My younger sister ( 16 F) recently moved from Canada to Vietnam for high school, and just completed her first year of highschool.For some more context, Vietnamese is a very tonal language. Tones go up and down, so it’s a very hard language on the ears. My sister has a very high pitched voice, so it is already irritable to listen to in English, Vietnamese is another issue.My sister speaks mainly Vietnamese at home, which is a BIG inconvenience at home. I suggested that we only speak to her in English when she first came here so she would have a easy time adjusting to highschool. But my older brother keeps spoiling her, he studied a bit in Vietnam so he knows more Vietnamese then me, but for the past 3 years he’s been learning Vietnamese for our younger sister.Because of my brother, my sisters English skills are improving like a damn slug. And I can barely communicate with her.So fast forward, my boyfriend is over at our house while my brother and sister are playing. Play wrestling and tickling each other  like siblings do, and my brother is wining the fight so my sister is laughing and squealing in Vietnamese ( keep in mind what I said about the Vietnamese language and her high pitched voice).My boyfriend finds it annoying, and I do too.My boyfriend asks her if she can speak English and she said yes, so he said that she should start speaking more English.My brother gets up and defends her, saying that some Canadian guy shouldn’t tell a child what language they should speak in their own home.I defend my boyfriend, because he’s done nothing wrong. Her voice is irritable, so I get where he’s coming from.I tell my sister that she should start speaking English, and give up the Vietnamese because she’s in Canada.And like the spoiled little teenager she is, she cries and my brother just defends her as usual. Seriously, I don’t get why she’s so sensitive.After my boyfriend left, me and my brother had a huge argument. He said that this was a big adjustment for a young girl, and we should be considerate of her.I tell him that I’m just trying to help her, and the only reason she’s falling behind is because of her English skills. She has 90s in math and science, but 60s in social studies and English.I say that we shouldn’t adjust to her, she should adjust to us, she’s in a English speaking country.My brother just shakes his head, sighs and leaves.Now my brother refuses to talk to me and my sister is avoiding me, probably because if something my brother said.Am I the asshole for just wanting the best for my sister?",

My girlfriend hasn't been wearing it for awhile now because she said she needed to get gold chain for it. I told her she already has a chain. But she apparently can't wear it because it's made of silver, and she's \"allergic\" to silver. I don't know how anyone can be allergic to silver, since it's in a lot of things.

And my sister visited us. I've been worried about her, to show I still care for her health and such, I gave her my girlfriend's locket as a gift. My sister loved it, and she's not allergic to silver and thought it was cute.When my girlfriend came home, she ended up finding out I gave away her lock. She demanded I go retrieve her locket.

Throughout being married to her for 14 years, I've had to sit quiet and just let her silence my own culture and not teach our kids about their American side.This day I had made it a point to say something. The guests had arrived and I noticed some of them skipping over the food she had made. Luckily some of the kids parents brought small sweets along with their gift. While my wife was socializing my mother came up to me and pointed out the food.I was so glad she agreed with me on this and urged me to say something. When guests started to leave I asked my wife if I could speak to her. She told me I was being rude interrupting. This was my last straw and I blew up. I yelled at her saying \"THIS FOOD SHOULDN'T BE HERE NO ONE LIKES IT STOP MAKING IT!\"Both our daughters were beside her and she waved them to go inside. She looked at me and bumped into me following behind the girls. Later that night I tried to tell her that it's important our kids know they're American as well and she told me that there was \"no loving culture to learn about\" and sent the girls to stay with their grandmother that weekend.She's been giving me the silent treatment this week and only making dinner for her and the girls.

	"body" : "I work in a Chinese restaurant and there was a new kitchen help on her first day. She said she have been working in kitchens for more than a decade.We were cleaning up and putting things away in the freezers after we closed the kitchen. I gave her a plastic container filled with meatballs and told her to put it 'on' the tall freezer, I immediately realized I should have said 'in' the tall freezer. But surely no one is that dumb to put it 'on' a 8 foot tall freezer. But yes, she managed to put it 'on' the 8 foot tall freezer.The top 10 inches of the freezer is just the control panel so in the back there's 10 inches of empty space with no covering on the sides and the back. So the container with 150+ meatballs fell 10 inches onto the freezer from the front panel and all the meatballs just rolled down from top of the freezer onto the dirty kitchen floor. She started screaming omg omg, I said I should have told her to put 'in' the freezer. She kept saying sorry and sorry, she was picking up the meatballs from the floor and I also started picking them up and I was holding in laughters.Then two people who were doing the dishes in the next room heard us and came to ask what happened, they started laughing which caused me to also start laughing. She just kept saying sorry and covering her face with her hands, then I kept saying through laughters that it was mostly my fault and not hers. We kept laughing for like a good two minutes.Then two waiters from the front came in, they also started laughing after learning what had happened. One of them grabbed a stool and got on it to reach for the container that's at the back of the control panel of the freezer, he started laughing again while his body was pressed against the freezer so the freezer started to shake, then one of the waiter shouted \"stop laughing, the freezer is shaking!\" Then we all started laughing even more, at that point the new girl have left the room.So the next day she didn't show, and our boss told us that she have quit.I feel so bad for her, if that happened to me on my first day, I would never leave my room for like three months. It was partly my mistake, I feel so bad, at the same time I still want to laugh whenever I think about it. So am I the asshole?",

	"body" : "My fiance and I (both 19, non-binary) got engaged on Thanksgiving 2023 after only being together for a few months. We made the decision to wait to tell our families until Christmas 2023 as a dun Christmas surprise.When we went to see my mom, I was prepared for her to say something about it because she thinks we are rushing into things too quickly and she is a bit of a helicopter mom. When we told her, her reaction was exactly that. She did say she was happy for us but told us we should hold off on the wedding for a couple years (i.e. 2026 or later) to make sure we want to get married. We both just brushed it off and our plan is still to get married in October of 2024.We told the rest of my close family/friends and so far everyone else has been really happy for us besides my grandmother (mom's mom). My grandma reacted the same way as my mom but has told us multiple times that she is happy for us and has welcomed my fiance with open arms so I'm not too worried.Currently the problem is that every time I even mention the wedding (and sometimes when I don't) my mom has to bring up that we should wait to get married. She doesn't even listen to me when I tell her that my fiance is the love of my life/soulmate and neither my fiance or I can think of a way that we wouldn't be together.It got to the point where I was physically sick with emotion because one of the things I dreamed about was going to wedding boutiques and doing wedding stuff with my mom. Like that's what mom's usually do when their child is getting married. I also have distanced myself from really doing anything to plan for the wedding which my fiance understands but we are on a bit of a time crunch so we are a bit behind on things.I am to the point where I am currently ignoring calls/texts from my mom because I don't want to hear her thoughts about the wedding. I have also decided to tell her that if she doesn’t want to support my fiance and I getting married and will just keep commenting on it that she will be uninvited from the wedding and I don't really want her to be apart of my life anymore.AITA for deciding to tell my mom this?Edit: I forgot to add that I don't have a very strong relationship with my mom because she doesn't understand that I'm non-binary and that I don't like guys.Edit 2: I read a lot of comments about concern for marrying young and that a parent should be worried about their child marrying young. I guess part of my family (my dad's side, including myself) is used to it because a lot of the family married young on that side. I did ask my dad what he thought about it and he said as long as we have the money to pay for wedding costs go for it but if we don't then we should wait. Also, for clarification, my fiance will be 20 by the day of the wedding and I turn 20 about a month after the wedding.",

One of my favorite things to do now that I'm Free is go shirtless-- after a shower, while making dinner, working in the yard etc. It's very nice. However, the last time I visited my parents I asked if they'd be comfortable if I occasionally didn't wear a shirt (not to the same extreme, but for example going back to my room after a shower or going swimming). They said no; while they respect my identity they don't want to see me shirtless at any time. This isn't them being prudes- my dad does the same thing. Sometimes he even goes sunbathing shirtless. So I feel like their being kind of hypocritical by saying it would make them uncomfortable if I did it. However, I also don't want to start a whole bunch of drama over it.

He constantly gets rejected in real life and has literally no matches on any apps (he showed me, besides scammers nothing). He is really worried because he is getting older and time is running out to find someone to start a family.It is very hard for him to save money after rent and I felt that him buying a house would give him some stability and allow him to save more of his paycheck and also make him more desirable for women. For this reason, I decided to gift him a down-payment on a house so he can pay a mortgage that will be less than his rent.However this started a disagreement with my daughter because she feels she should get money now as well. Her situation however is very different. She is younger, doesn't want to get married or have kids. She is objectively very good looking and literally complains about men asking her out all the time, gets cat called everywhere she goes etc.She has a degree from Berkley, worked at Meta and then got laid off and while she is struggling a little bit since the lay off due to student loans, she is a software engineer so she will eventually be making a lot of money as it is a lucrative field, more than enough for someone who wants to be single.

I messaged the group chat and said that if dirty dishes kept being left on the side then I’d throw them away - she replied and said she was understanding that it’s frustrating but a lot of the dishes are hers and I’d be punishing her for someone else’s uncleanliness.

I made her demonstrate to me how to turn it on and off, where all the tools were, etc. I was pretty confident that this would be an easy enough task, but she was determined to prove me wrong. As I pulled in the driveway, I noticed black scotch marks on the front of my house, and some of the vinyl siding had begun to melt. The grill was still there, and fortunately my wife had turned it off, but I was still furious.I stormed into the house and demanded to know what happened. My wife came up with a stupid excuse of not thinking the steaks were cooking, which then caused her to turn up the heat. She then explained that the grease from the steaks had started a fire and she got the assistance of a neighbor to put it out. Needless to say, I was mortified. I couldn't believe that she dragged our neighbor into this and embarrassed us with this little stunt, but then I caught a glimpse of the steaks. They were like charred, shriveled hockey pucks. I could tell just by looking at them that they were inedible.I told my wife that she might as well just throw the steaks away, since she couldn't be bothered to cook them properly.

They are not, however, taking my other granddaughter (3), Hensley.My DIL has always been cold to me and my side of the family. No fights have ever taken place, I’ve always gone out of my way to be nice to her because it’s who my son decided to love, but she just never comes around. Never has really. In the beginning I asked my son if we’d done something wrong but he’d just say “she’s shy”. There was never any other explanation and I just stopped asking eventually.Well it seems her coldness towards us isn’t changing anytime soon but now that it’s effecting Hensley I’m pissed. There’s really no reason that she needs to exclude her from this trip or any trips. They aren’t hurting for money to take her — she’s a nurse and he has a good paying job too. And DIL’s side of the family is going (mom and sisters) and splitting the expenses of the trip which only means that they have even more money to spare to buy little Hensley park tickets.I tried to be more understanding when Hensley was a baby and hard to travel with. They go on an annual beach trip each summer and have never once offered to bring her. But now she’s getting older and hearing Lila talk about all of these fun things and not understanding why she can’t also go to Disney world. I finally lost it on my son about my growing distaste for his wife and her treatment towards Hensley. I’ve but my tongue for years but it’s not fair to her. I also told him that he’s a sorry excuse for a man to let anyone exclude their own blood the way that they do. I’m at my wits end and I told him if things don’t change with Hensley I would be confronting his wife. He got mad and claims it’s not their responsibility to take Hensley to these places but that’s selfish because he knows Hensley can’t go without them. I would love to take her to Disney or the Beach myself but I don’t have any money to put towards a vacation right now and neither does her mother, my daughter, and her dad doesn’t help out at all.

I looked at James to defend me and then he got up and left. Matt looked at me and when I didn’t move, he said “Get the fuck out.”So AITA?",

I respect people that have cats, however truth be told they are basically just a worse version of dogs and a pet for just people that dont have enough money or space to adopt a dog, they dont love you the same way like dogs do, and dont even are capable of feeling loveThats why, when i found out my gf was a cat person and owned one cat i was very surprised, and disappointed. I decided to hide these feelings for some time, since i knew if i told how much i disliked cats she would be mad at me, but when the time came and we started plans to move together, she said she planned to bring the cat she had with us. I said no, offering to adopt to her a dog instead to replace the cats, and even offering to help her with the costs and training...and she refused.

Typically, when I do this, I depart either really late at night or really early in the morning to save some money on the tickets, and this year was no exception. I reserved a seat on a bus departing at 5:30 AM.Well, when I got to the bus station, I noticed that my particular bus was full. I couldn't believe the number of people traveling so early in the morning, but then I noticed a young mother traveling with two small kids. They seemed to be in a pretty good mood, but then when we all boarded, they started to throw a tantrum. The mother was trying to shush them and even offered them things like apple juice and toys, but nothing was working. Worse still, the whining soon became screaming, and it was extremely uncomfortable for me and the other passengers.I had planned to sleep on the bus, but with these little monsters making this much noise, I could barely even hear myself think. This went on for 15-20 minutes, until I finally had enough. They were sitting a few rows behind me, and I loudly told the mom \"Maybe you should try being a parent because nobody wants to hear that crap.\" I was the one courageous enough to voice what everyone else was thinking, but she took it as an insult and said \"How dare you judge my parenting skills. I'm doing my best and the kids are tired.\" I couldn't believe this. She literally admitted that her kids were tired, yet she decided to travel at 5:30 AM, and somehow that was MY problem?I told her that she should take a later bus if her kids were so tired and that it was completely unfair to subject the other passengers to these two screaming turds. She told me to \"get a life,\" and then put in earbuds so she could ignore me. When I finally got to my destination, I had a horrible headache, but when I told my family what happened, they told me that it was me who crossed the line. They said that the lady and her kids had \"every right\" to be on the bus and that I had shown a lack of tact. I couldn't believe that my own family members were ganging up on me in this way.

But when I'm talking it just comes out because I'm thinking it. Who doesn't want to say what they are thinking, but that's where most people's filter kicks in, but NOT ME!So by the time we get are appetizer, I'm 2 frozen drinks in, and Gilbert and I are having a good time as men do why the women are chatting it up.Well by the main course gets here, I'm feeling pretty good and my filter is GONE! So now that dinner has arrived we are all in the same conversation. Gilbert and his wife are talking about being new parents and the due date is almost here. So Gilbert's wife tells us they are having a baby boy! So we are congratulating them and toast to the new parents and baby boy. At this point I'm 3 drinks in with Gilbert, because we are not driving home!I should of said this earlier, that I dont remember anybody's name once they are introduced to me, my brain just doesn't hold onto that information for whatever reason. So as Gilbert's wife told us that the baby's boy name is going to be Gilbert, I yelled out \"GILBERT!\". I started laughing histaracly and couldn't stop, my wife was kicking me under the table non stop while I was laughing.So I finally was able to get out \"Why would you name your kid GILBERT? He will get made fun of his whole life!\" Gilbert and his wife looked devastated, my wife grabs me and says somewhat quietly \"His name is Gilbert!\". Without hesitation I looked at Gilbert and said \"SEE YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THEN!\" I just couldn't stop laughing for a few minutes.So with my leg throbbing from my wife kicking me under the table, the mood completely went south from there, we finished the dinner mainly in silence. My wife was upset with me when we left that night, but she knows I don't have much of a filter. After that she stopped inviting me to dinners because I was costing her clients, and bonuses and fully paid for tropical trips for 2. I also got the benefit of those.Now a few months later I ran into Gilbert totally by chance. When I saw him I yelled loudly and said \"Hey man what's up!\" He was kind enough and came over and talked to me.

While her and I were friends I shared a lot about my insecurities. I used to be 300 pounds and was very insecure about it. I went on a weight loss journey but she always felt the need to compete with me but she wasn't able to lose the weight. If I worked out for an hour she had worked out for 2 or, if I chose something healthy on the menu she would laugh at me. Despite us drifting this hasn't really gone away. I have lost some weight and am at a healthy weight now. It's important to note I only lost weight for health reasons and not appearance reasons, despite this, I think losing weight has made men more attracted to me(not that this is important). I am now thinner than her, she is chubby but not fat like I was.Of course she was at my wedding, she was a bridesmaid and her and I were actually getting along well and there were few issues. She was actually super supportive during the whole process. The ceremony was gorgeous and I wouldn't hesitate to call it the best day of my life. During the reception the cake came out and everyone was having it and I noticed that she wasn't. I could see her eyeing me as I ate cake. I had 2 slices and by the time I was on my second slice I could feel her eyes. I felt like she was judging me for eating cake after my weight loss. I think she is jealous because I was able to lose weight and she wasn't. I was tipsy and decided to confront her. I asked her what her problem was and why she isn't eating the cake. She seemed offended but didn't say anything. This upset me more and I lost it, I told her she thinks she's a good person when she's really not. I also accused her of being in love with my husband. She left in tears and the rest of the night was tainted from the interaction. My maid of honor texted me and told me I way overreacted and some other guests shared her sentiment.

It said that a little girl had been abducted by her father, and was last seen five hours earlier, in a region 94km (58 miles) to the west of me, heading east in a car with (this make, model, and plate).I complained on Facebook that the alert shouldn't have been sent so broadly, and especially to people whose devices had been deliberately silenced, at midnight, when those DND device owners were likely dead asleep. My stance is that the tech shouldn't be overridden like that... or at the very least, it should be used with more nuance. (Alert phones that AREN'T in DND mode. Require manufacturers to have a software switch allowing alerts, set to \"on\" by default if you like. Et cetera.) My contention was that people who are most likely asleep at midnight with their phones on mute are in a poor position to help you spot a specific car from five hours ago and 58 miles away.Additional context: I have been unemployed for over a year, and have been in a difficult struggle to get another job. I was thinking keenly of my wife, our family's sole bread-winner at the moment, who has a long commute in the morning, and who cut our Valentine's Day evening short so that she could get enough sleep for the day ahead. I also have kids of my own, and obviously would not want to see harm come to them.To complicate people's feelings about the situation, the subject of the Amber Alert was found dead, about 138km/85 miles east of where the alert originated. So anyone complaining about the alert sounding through on phones that were specifically, deliberately silenced must be an asshole, right? Because dead kid?(It's a stupid Catch-22 for the sake of a weak argument, though. If the girl  had been found alive, their stance would have been \"See? The alert worked.\"  :|  )Am I (and the many, many people who called the police stations to complain) the asshole?",

	"body" : "I didn’t think I was the asshole here but it’s been months now and my coworker is getting more hostile.So I 31(F) loath the phrase “good morning”. I hate mornings. This is going to sound dramatic but I compare leaving my bed every morning to a break up. I live in the far North and mornings are cold and I’m always freezing. Mornings just aren’t fun for me.I’ve worked at the same place for the last three years. My coworkers all know I don’t like the phrase and all but one have stopped saying it to me. One coworker 67(M)insists on saying it still. I don’t make a big deal out of it. I usually will either just say “Morning” back or “What’s so good about it?” in a light hearted tone.One day a few months ago I was having a particular bad morning. One of my dogs had explosive diarrhea all over the floor, wall and me. When I showed up to work this coworker immediately said “good morning”. I didn’t respond because I didn’t feel the need to. After I didn’t respond he went off. Started trying to tell me how no morning is ever bad and how the sun is shining and I’m on the right side of the ground, plus a bunch of other things. I waited for him to finish his rant and then sternly told him that he cannot tell me how I feel, that I am my own person and I feel like I’m having a bad day he cannot minimize that because he thinks I should be having a good day. He tried to interrupt me and one of the owners told him to stop.Now the problem is he hasn’t talked to me at all since this moment other than to say things like “it’s too bad you didn’t fall off that ladder.” Or to talk about me while I’m there. Things like “OP doesn’t make enough money to complain.” It was my birthday and a coworker asked him if he’d wished me a happy birthday and he said “I don’t speak to OP anymore”. More recently if I am in a conversation be it with a customer or coworker he will suddenly start speaking to them as if I’m not there not even caring if he interrupted an important conversation. His behaviour has lead me to believe I might be the AH here. So Reddit AITA?Edit: I don’t tell people that they can’t say good morning nor am I rude in my reply to their greeting. My coworkers just picked up on that I never say good morning and asked me about it. After this They started to greet me the same as I do with them which is “Morning”. I’d never go off and tell someone not to say it to me. I have a few coworkers who also don’t like it and say “good afternoon” all the time prior to me even working there.",

	"title" : "AITA for announcing my pregnancy at my brother's \"wedding\" ?",
	"body" : "Ok, so the reason I put wedding in quotations in the title is cause my brother is gay and in our country same sex marriages aren't approved yet, so this was like a family party more than anything (not to mention he's known the guy he's marrying for only one year, so I didn't really think he'd consider this as a real wedding).I (28F) am pregnant in 3 months with my husband (27M) of 3 years. We only recently found out and I thought I could use my brother's (23M) incoming \"wedding\" to announce it to my close family, as my parents, siblings and even some cousins would be there. As I said, I thought this was more of a performative event and I didn't think my brother would be upset over my announcement, I actually thought he'd be glad that I chose his party to make my pregnancy known. However, he ended up being livid after I revealed my pregnancy, accusing me of not being able to not make things about myself for this one night in his life. I apologized and said that I didn't know he took this event so seriously, but that only angered him more and made him kick me and my husband from his party.My husband and my parents agree that my brother overreacted, but my siblings all think that I was a self centered asshole and I should give him a proper apology this time (even though I don't see anything invalid with my first apology, I really didn't think he'd be so mad over it).AITA ?",

We were having an argument today and she was complaining about some of my actions... like that I'm not cleaning up after myself, but I have a cold right now and so I'm not thinking about that. I told her she complains all the time about me and she is a negative person when it comes to me and life in general. I told her she complains every day about things. That is just a part of her personality she should work on. She wanted examples of how she is a generally negative person and I could not think of any but told her I would tell her when it happens. Then she was feeling sad later about me telling her she's negative and so I told her this is an example of how she is negative and dramatic. She feels very hurt and thinks I'm wrong for saying the truth.Edit: So you guys think it is ok for her to just complain about me every day? I do so much for her. She should focus on that and not complain about insignificant things. I do clean but I have not been feeling well for the past weeks.Edit: I have a few things I do around the home, mainly cleaning the floor and I was cleaning up after myself but the last month no because I wasn't feeling well.

	"body" : "So I, (23male),suffer from a history of behavioural problems which have prevented me from achieving any highschool diploma or credentials (GED equivalent, ect.) My mom and dad divorced when I was around fifteen and my dad has been pretty minimal contact since. I have ADHD, binge eating triggered by PTSD caused by my father, extreme depression, anxiety, and I want to be diagnosed with bipolar as well, so I’m currently trying to see somebody for that.So because of my behavioural issues and mental illnesses, I can’t hold down a job and I get really demotivated doing basic chores around the house. I’m currently living with my mother(56f). We’ve been having to hire a cleaner to clean around the house and my mom is tired of spending the money. She can’t do much around the house because of some chronic pain, idk, so she’s been asking me to ‘pick up the slack’.I told her I never asked to be brought into this world and pretty much blew up on her. We normally get into fights but it felt different this time which is why i’m posting. She told me she’s tired of always cleaning up after my messes and called me a bunch of mean things.I honestly need to get on AISH and move out but it takes a long time to get put on it in case anyone is asking.Anyways, should I help my mom around the house more?I think i’m right to think that because of all of my conditions literally making it 100x harder for me to preform a simple task then anybody else, i shouldn’t be burdened with all of the house labour.I could also be an asshole though because I do rely on her so much, and I feel like maybe I should try my best to help out more and take the pressure off of her back, she is a single mom after all.AITA?EDIT: this got a lot of backlash, im sorry and i’m trying my best right now i promise. there’s a lot of things i’m reflecting on today, thanks for the judgement.EDIT TWO: (April 10th 2023 at 4:56PM PDT)alright so i read a lot of replies and while harsh i needed it, i’ll stay away from dating until i better myself and i’m trying to do better at home. i’m in vancouver and housing is expensive so i’m gonna have to work around that if i plan to move out. the homeless shelters here have a notoriously bad reputation so i hope it doesn’t come to that. i didn’t want a girlfriend to mooch off of solely, i just meant if i found a girlfriend and we moved in together we could pay rent together. and as for my other posts about my addiction, i probably should’ve mentioned that here but didn’t see that it was relevant information for this post. to everybody saying i should use my drug money to pay for a cleaner, i couch hop when i’m not at home and use what the people around me offer. i have a very messy history with money, and have done some not so great things to get it. i owe a couple different people a few hundred bucks each too, whom i’m actively avoiding. life is so messy. anyways, others are recommending i get treatment, i’ve taken medication before but nothing that either worked or i didn’t abuse",

	"body" : "Edit: I concede that I was the AH here. But please do not send the Reddit Cares thing again. I love being on this planet.I (21M) have a sister (30F) who builds her own furniture and does renovation all by herself, which I think is awesome. In the summer, she closed on her house and started working on it. Obviously she hired professionals when she needed certain things done, but she decided to tackle the living room, herself.The way it turned out was a little off objectively. The main problem was that she bought this giant electric fireplace. They are very inefficient heaters, and the flames do not look real at all. And she said she spent $1,200 on it. (Also, they go for like $300 on Amazon last I checked.) She also put a super cheap TV on top of it. The viewing angles were some of the worst I have ever seen in a modern TV. The colors looked off unless you stood up and right in front of it. I belong to a community that discusses placement of TVs, so this is kind of important to me as somebody who wants to be an interior designer or technician one day.When my sister showed me her living room, I said, \"The TV seems a little high. You should be able to view it straight on instead of looking up.\" She said, \"I mean, I like to recline or lay on the couch when I watch TV. It seems fine to me. It keeps my kids out of the way, too.\" I sat down on the couch and showed her the proper way of viewing a TV, and she said, \"Dude. Nobody watches TV like that. Or sits on a couch all stiff like that.\" I asked her if she uses her phone held up high in the air, too, and she accused me of being nit picky. I pulled out my phone and showed her the community I read, and she said I could have the \"stupid app\" yell at her TV placement all she wants, but this is still her living room at the end of the day. She said that if it bothers me that much, we can just meet up for Burger King next time. I told her I was just trying to help, and she said, \"I literally never asked for your help.\" I told her she should not show people her living room if she does not want people to talk about her living room, and she implied I lack social skills and said I need to get out more and make IRL friends (no thanks). I ended up letting myself out and called my neighbor to take me home.... So here I am asking if IATA on this \"stupid app.\" AITA?",

While they other boys were talking about how big some girls boobs were, I was thinking how cute football team looked in there uniform. So with all of my 14 year old wisdom I got on the computer and asked \"how do you know your gay?\" However this being over 20 years ago I was used the family computer and, you probably guess it I didn't erase the search history, which is how my parents found out that I was gay and through me out of the house. I was on the streets for over 11 months until my grandfather(fathers side)saved me. My family(father side) and I cut contract with them but, when my grandmother had a health scare a couple of years ago they were brought back into the family however I'm still very low contact. I think thats enough family history. Also some relative information. Now at the age of 35 I'm really well off and I'm married to an equal if not more wealthy man. We own a house that my grandfather jokingly calls a mini mansion with granny flat/pool house.Last Saturday was my uncle's 60th birthday party and the whole family was there and so was my parents I avoid them at this types of things and the usually avoid me. So I was sitting at a table having a few beers with my cousins, when my parents approached me saying they wanted to talk. I just stared at them while they launched into this big speech about how I can't keep living in the past and how I need to move on because, they were struggling now because of the big bug and, how they were going to lose the house and, how I have to let them live with me. I couldn't help it the shear audacity for these people and I started to laughing I had to of laughed for over 20 minutes, I laughed so hard I fell off my chair and my sides hurt. When I was finally able to catch my breath I told them no and to f*ck off and, went off to find my husband.I didn't think I was an asshole until my grandmother who I respect called and said that while she understood and respects my decision not to help them. laughing at them in front of the family when they were asking for help was cold and cruel of me.

While we were planning in our group chat, most of the guys in the group pushed for going on Thursday night. This wasn't typical as we usually only hang out on weekends but I assumed it was just when folks happened to be free and didn't think much more of it.On the day of when we all arrived and took turns paying for the admission price, I noticed one of the guys in the group being charged a lower price than what I paid. At first I assumed that he had a coupon or something, but then I asked the cashier what was up. He went on to tell me that on Thursday nights the escape room had a \"boys' night\" promotion where all male attendees would receive 20% off their price of admission. I was caught off guard since the idea of a price difference based on gender hadn't even crossed my mind. I asked if the cashier if they also had an equivalent \"girls' night\" promotion and he told me no.I went on to ask the other girls in the group if they knew about the boys being charged less and it turned out they had no idea either. I was pissed in the moment but we were about to go in so I didn't push it further at the time.After I got home I looked on the escape room's website and sure enough, it had the boys' night promotion listed. I calculated the total price based on everyone there and figured out how much the boys would need to pay the girls back if we were to share the total cost of the group evenly. This morning I texted my calculation to the group chat and said the boys needed to pay the girls back because it wasn't fair that us girls had to pay more. After some back and forth the boys called me an asshole for being \"cheap\" and \"petty\"So AITA?",

	"body" : "So my bf and I have been together for 2 and a half years. We'll call him Adden. We're in college. I could definitely see myself marrying him one day. The thing is he has been lying to me and it caused us to have a big argument.We live together, and I share everything with him. I've told him all about my fucked up relationship with my parents and he agreed they sound awful. I've met his aunt, not his parents. When his aunt first came over she started tearing up the second she saw him and said she was so thankful he was okay. I should have picked up on the red flag, but I didn't.Well, I was on his laptop because mine died when I got a text from someone he went to counseling with. She basically said that she's sorry for bringing it up but she hopes his mom rotts in jail for a lifetime. She said she deserved it for what she did to him, and it makes her cry thinking about how much better he was doing.That night I asked my bf again about his parents and he said they weren't close, his dad died, and he doesn't remember much of his childhood. So I did research myself with multiple friends. It was easy because we knew his birthday, full name, etc, and it came out his mom was in jail for a long time for child abuse, child neglect, child endangerment, etc. The list goes on.I ended up confronting Adden about this and he confessed. He said he didn't like talking about it, but his mom was... well, crazy. She homeschooled him and would sneak drugs in his food to keep him relient on her. She was worried he would go to college, and wanted to stop that the best she could. Which it worked. He would be super out of it and sleep for a majority of the day. It wasn't until he turned 18 that he run away with his aunts help, she helped him get clean by locking him in a room without any drugs, and reported his mom.To say I was shocked would be an understatement. I felt hurt and lied too. He kept saying he had a bad memory, no. He couldn't remember his childhood because he was drugged out for most of it. I couldn't believe that he wouldn't trust me with this. We were best friends. I shared everything with him. He tried to explain himself. He said he wanted to start over a new leaf in college, he didn't want anyone to know about his past. He wanted to be a normal kid.But I still feel betrayed. I told him I feel like he doesn't love me, that's why he hid it. I mean. how many years before he told me. I also felt bad about complaining about my family when his is so much worse. But also, I feel like an addiction is something you should confess in a relationship. My dad was an alcoholic and it was hell to deal with. He said the difference is that he never chose to take drugs, they were put in his food. I said still, what if they gave you drugs after surgery and you got hooked again? Isn't this something I should know to make sure that doesn't happen? How could he hide this? AITA here?",

He said he didn’t like that because it was showing my ego. From his perspective, we were both comfortable and warm in bed and I could’ve gotten up to get it myself. Why should he get up and do it when I’m perfectly capable of it? He also said I was being lazy.I explained that yes, I was comfortable in bed and that is probably why I asked him to grab me some water in that moment. But I asked because it was something I would appreciate from him, and it would make me happy. Why wouldn’t he want to do that simple gesture? I’m having trouble wrapping my head around his resistance for doing nice things for me.I told him if he asked me to do the same of course I would because I want to make him happy and I know it’s something he’d appreciate. He said he would never ask me to do that though, because he’s perfectly capable of doing it himself.Am I letting my ego show? Please help, I don’t want to be an asshole :(Edit: My own curiosity has gotten the best of me. Those who are commenting, I would love to know if you are currently in relationship. I wonder if this has any baring over one’s opinion? I’ve been getting very mixed responses and am genuinely curious.Edit 2: Someone said I should add this comment I made to give more context since here it is!“Not trying to defend myself (well, I guess by definition I am haha) but when I think about it I do feel I do things for my boyfriend to try and show I care. I’ll clean his apartment when he’s at work, make the bed for him even though it’s not something he does for himself, etc. I think this might be why I didn’t think it was the biggest deal to ask him to do a favor for me.”Edit 3 (and most likely final): A lot more people have chimed into this post than I initially expected. I’ve been trying to respond to people who have (mostly) civil.Wanted to clear a few things up: A lot of people have been mentioning I am “playing mind games” by asking if he could get me a glass of water. While I can’t know for sure if that’s what I was doing subconsciously, I promise it was not that deep lol. It was such a fleeting moment. To me I was just asking a favor, just as he has asked me in other scenarios.I didn’t demand, I asked. And he said sure. A LOT of assumptions are being made about the type of people my boyfriend and I are. If you need more info, just ask me to clarify and I’ll be upfront and honest. It’s crazy to me that people are assuming I “constantly nag” and am “purposefully manipulating” him. Same goes for my boyfriend, please don’t assume he’s a terrible person I should just ditch. After reading through the comments, I think at the end of the day we show our love in different ways. A lot of people have been saying my love language is acts of service and it made sense to me.Edit 4: Forgot to mention another assumption being made. This is my fault for not being clear in the comments. We weren’t laying in bed saying our goodnights with the lights out. We were watching TV and both occasionally getting up to go to the bathroom or something like that. Not sure if this makes a difference for people.",

	"body" : "I find myself in a bit of a situation, and I need your input to know if I'm the asshole in this scenario. So, let me provide some context first.My friend and I have known each other for years, and we're really close. We often engage in playful pranks and sometimes help each other out in unique ways. One thing I've developed a skill for over time is waxing. I've waxed a few friends before, and it has always been fun experience for both parties involved.Recently my friend mentioned how he wanted to get rid of some body hair jokingly complaining about how it was getting out of control. He didn't think I'd take it seriously but I thought it would be a fun opportunity to surprise him and help him out simultaneously.A few days ago, when he was at my place, I decided to go all out and wax his entire body. He laughed throughout the process and it seemed like he was enjoying the experience at first but I was so giddy by the time we finished his back that I playfully waxed his eyebrows off. He didn’t explicitly tell me to stop or anything and we were just having so much fun but afterward he's been pretty upset and distant. A few days later I asked him about it and he’s saying he feels uncomfortable and that I crossed a boundary.Now here's where I'm confused. In the past, I've waxed some of my other friends, and it was all in good fun. They loved it and even asked for repeat sessions. I honestly didn't expect this reaction from my current friend, considering our history of playful camaraderie.But I can see now that I might have overstepped this time. I didn't think he'd react negatively and I feel terrible for making him feel uncomfortable. However, I want to emphasize that my intentions were never malicious; I genuinely thought we were just having some lighthearted fun.So, Reddit, am I the asshole for waxing my friend completely, including his eyebrows, without his explicit consent even though I thought we were just playing around? I'm open to your judgments and willing to make amends if needed.TL;DR: I waxed my male friend's entire body, including his eyebrows, without realizing he'd be upset as we've engaged in similar playful interactions before. Now he's uncomfortable, and I'm wondering if I crossed a line and if I'm the asshole in this situation.",

Last Saturday Beatrice turned 14, for her birthday she wanted to go to a theme park. This park is a long drive away and the tickets are expensive, so this is a big deal for her, I spent extra on purchasing a fast pass to make sure she could go on all the rides she wanted to.Anyway, I asked Beatrice if she would like her brother to come (he had been asking), she said she would like that as long as we would still be able to go on all the rides she wanted to.This is because we can't leave Max alone at the park, it is very busy and there is nowhere for him to wait where we can see him, Max also isn't comfortable being left alone in an unknown place with strangers.I spoke to Max, I said he could come as long as he would be ok with going on all of the rides his sister wanted to, even the big ones. He promised and everything seemed fine.Anyway, we got there and went on a few smaller rides until Beatrice was ready to go on a larger one, this was one of the ones she had been looking forward to the most, but when we got to the front of the line Max started crying and refusing to go on. We went on other smaller rides, my daughter was disappointed and I told him off, making it clear he was in trouble.When we got home I told him he wasn't going to be able to use his Xbox for a week as punishment for ruining his sisters birthday after he had asked to come and promised he would go on all the ridesMy sister found out and is saying I am the AH, I can see what she means but at the same time I made clear these would be intense rides",

She hasn’t driven in while so she wanted me to help her practice driving in the rain more and I promised I would last night (the last time it’ll rain in our area for a bit) but it completely slipped my mind and I got caught up in my hobby.I generally have no problem letting my sister use the car but we got into an argument over her staying out passed 7PM (sunset) so I told her if she ever did that again I would not open the door to let her in the house.Last night she took the car and went out driving in the pouring rain. She apparently got scared midway when it started raining harder because the roads were “too blurry” and she didn’t “feel safe”. So she says she parked somewhere and waited until the rain calmed down and drove back when it wasn’t pouring. She got home 9:50! I was worried all night because she didn’t tell anyone where she was heading. I did not let her inside. I only opened the door to take my keys back and I told her she’ll either have to find somewhere else to stay or wait until my parents get back to let her inside. My parents got back at around 10:30 and saw her drenched. Now they’re mad at me for taking it too far even though I warned her about what would happen if she did that again. I also don’t believe her made up story about waiting until the rain calmed down because if she really was scared she would have called me.Edit: I was occasionally watching her while she was outside so wasn’t in danger or anything. Also, as soon as my parents come she started shivering and I never noticed her do this for the whole 40 minutes she was out there which just proves she was lying to make herself seem like the victim. I don’t know how you can trust someone who lies like that to be “independent”. Imagine what she could’ve gotten herself into. ALSO my parents are talking about me potentially having to move out over this??? I doubt they will follow through but is that not overkill??",

She told me about her, a girl from my class and we had to meet to do some career projects, so we agreed to meet at a cafe on campus, I was surprised to see sam crying a lot, she looked very bad so I worried about her , I approached her and my friend told me that she broke up with her boyfriend and that I couldn't leave her alone, I told her that I didn't care and that we left the project for later, sam kept saying that her boyfriend was an idiot and i understand her, i don't explain much, i just know that in a fight sam's boyfriend threw out her apartment and she had nowhere to stay, i've been in this situation and it's horrible, so i told her she could stay with us and what could happen the night at our sleepover, this calmed her down a lot which made me happy, I know she did horrible things before, but I always thought that girls should always be together r and that my girlfriend would understand, but no, when I called her she She was scared, she was very, very angry and she wouldn't stop cursing. Tell me, I understand, but what sam did happened years ago and I didn't want to leave anyone alone who had suffered the same as me, to understand and accept it, I promised her that I would protect her and that we would have a good time, but she just said that she didn't want to see me at the sleepover so she hung up don't listen to me i understand her feelings but she must understand mine too i'm sure sam won't do anything to her she's hurtnow my girlfriend won't talk to me and i'm so confused and i don't know what to do, it's still early so i want to sort things out before it's dark so my girlfriend and sam are comfortable and i don't have to choose between my girlfriend or someone who needs my helpSo… reditt , AITA?EDIT: I wanted to thank all those men who sent me a message and tried by all means to treat me like trash, I didn't take sam to the sleepover, I apologized to her and told her I couldn't take her, she seemed very upset and I don't know where It will stay, I am very afraid that she will return with her boyfriend, when I got home my girlfriend was not there, I think she and her friends changed the place of the sleepover without telling me, I do not know what to do and I feel terrible, the comments of this post they just show me that violence towards girls is so normalized that you can't see sam as a victim despite her past and that none of you would help a colleague when she suffers and that worries me a lot, i don't think you really deserve an update after how they've treated me, but this is the last thing i'll say, i don't know what's going to happen with sam or my girlfriend, but i think in a way it's for the best, i don't think it's healthy for me to be with someone who doesn't even let me save a friend",

I feel like the reason she didn’t ask was because she knew I’d say no.For a bit of background I’ve always got the sense that she’s quite into me and I don’t reciprocate that at all, so her getting friendly with my dad and carrying my things just adds to this.I texted her and said not to contact me until I was ready as I was upset and she said I was an ahole, because she was just helping my dad, nothing about me",

She was happy about this when we had talked to her but now that it's time for the school year she is upset because she can't see her friends as much.She has herself brought up how another girl in her class changed last year, stopped wearing her head scarf etc and while our daughter isn't misguided we don't want to increase the risk. I also feel that even though she has learned to ignore the misguided parts, there's always a risk this changes as she gets into her teens.

She basically has too much on her plate to be able to handle each child individually and that creates a lot of tension with her emotions and also her needing to take care of her children, so she sometimes tries to make other people do the job of parenting.I find this not good as I know what its like to feel like a burden to a parent and I don’t want her kids feeling this way.The problem is she is now pregnant again with the 5th and I couldn’t help but say something.This week we had a pre-christmas family get together and when she got there I was already annoyed. Mind you like i said she has 4 children and isnt the best mom. Which means sometimes the kids do annoying rowdy shit and no one does anything.after a long while of children screaming and not behaving well she comes and asks me if I can please watch them and make sure theyre good for the rest of the time.  Mind you I (F25) am not a parent for this exact reason: I DON’T WANT KIDS.this was my breaking point with her and unfortunately in front of the whole family I snapped on her.I told her she needs to stop having kids as a fun thing and needs to keep her fucking legs shut as she is being a slut in her old age and her kids aren’t being any better.I told her that she looked absolutely disgusting in her pregnancy this time around as she is already gaining weight at her age and her belly was enormous and disturbing.This obviously caused a lot of tension, especially with my uncle, and a lot of family members to scold me and basically hate me now.Please tell me I am not the asshole.",

I was an alcoholic, had poor hygiene, was hopping from job to job, etc. But she saw something in me that nobody els did, not even me. I loved her, I loved her so so much.We were only 1 year into our relationship before getting married I didn’t listen to people saying it was too soon, I was so in love. She turned my life upside down, I was a better man all thanks to her. I was 23 when she gave birth to my son, that was the happiest day of my life everything was going great. As he got older he resembled his mother so much, his wavy black hair, his face shape, eyes, lips everything he had he got from his mother. He was the male version of my wife. We didn’t have a strong bond but we talked sometimes. He was definitely a lot closer to his mother but I was ok with that. My life was perfect but then everything came crashing down in one phone call.I was told my wife and son were in a car accident, I rushed to the hospital but unfortunately by then my beautiful wife had passed. My son was still alive, unconscious on a hospital bed but in that moment all I could think of was how my soulmate, my love, my everything was gone. However son made a full recovery. It hurt my heart every time I looked at him, I began to hate him and avoided him like the plague. The thought of him making it but not my wife made me furious. I would never hurt him but if it came down to him or her it’s obvious who I’d choose. I started drinking again, my mental health was very poor and I’d get into arguments with my son often. My life was the definition of hell.Four days ago my son was yelling at me for being “the worst father ever” and was ranting about how he needs help and how horrible his life was. I understand that he was hurting but so was I. I was ignoring him because I had already heard this rant a million times but then he snatched a bear out my hand and threw it on the floor, that’s when I snapped. I told him “You’re not the only one suffering. Stop being so self centred, just get over yourself!” There was more that I was going to say but he left the house, I made no effort to follow him assuming he just needed to be alone. I haven’t seen or heard from him since.The police have been looking for him but deep down I hope he doesn’t come back. I know that sounds bad but I shouldn’t be forced to take care of someone just because I’m related to them, I’m only human and I already spend most of my life depressed. I just want a fresh start. I do hope he’s doing well but he’s not welcome back into my home. Besides why would he want to live with “the worst father ever” he’s old enough to care for himself. Like I said I’m only human, he expected so from me when I was suffering just as much. So AITA?Update: he came back 2 days ago, I’m not sure who he was with (if he even was with anyone) but we haven’t said a word to each other. I’m not going into detail I just came on to say that he’s not on the streets anymore.",

	"body" : "For some context, I (F49) and my husband (M68) have been married for the past decade, and unfortunately haven't been able to conceive a natural child, so we ended up looking into adoption. That's how we ended up acquainted with Luther (FTM,19) and Brent (M18)Luther and Brent are both gay, international liberal arts students from Berlin, they had found out about the pregnancy at four months, making it too late to abort and decided to put the child up for adoption because they'd make awful parents. When we met, Luther had been 6 months along and constantly making self depreciating jokes about the pregnancy and generally looking depressed because of it. This had frustrated me at first, because I found it disgusting how he could be so ungrateful for a gift like pregnancy.Our relationship with Luther had always been strained because of stuff like that, whenever we met up to talk about the child, he'd always seem as if he'd rather be anywhere else than there and he'd constantly joke about how 'gross' the stomach had looked.Anyway, when he'd finally gone into labor, we'd organized for him to have a homebirth at my husband and I's home, we'd organized a midwife and all that was needed for it. Now, we live an hour away from where Luther and Brent had been renting an apartment, so when they finally got here Luther seemed sort of upset about the journey, I just shrugged off his negative feelings because at least they were here.During the birth, Luther and Brent spoke to each other only in German, which had upset me because I felt as if they were excluding my husband and I from our child's birth, and it had also angered me. Another thing about Luther that had angered me also was that he kept complaining about how it hurt and how he thought he'd be offered an epidural. I just felt like Luther was very entitled.The straw that broke the camel's back had been when after our baby boy had been brought into the world, when we tried to get Luther to hold our baby for the first time, he had refused. He said that he didn't want to hold the child and that he 'wouldn't know how to'. I shouted at him, telling him exactly what I thought of him, that he's entitled, irresponsible, spoiled, mentally ill and disgusting. Luther started being upset over that (which I think he was faking for sympathy points), and his boyfriend Brent shouted back at me, that I was a terrible, unempathetic woman and that he felt sorry for my child.I personally thought that I was in the right for standing up for my newborn baby, and my husband agrees with me, but clearly Luther and Brent don't think so, and my sister-in-law called me unsympathetic and an asshole for doing so. So, Reddit, am i the asshole?EDIT : okay, i get it, you guys think I'm a troll and the asshole. I ended up calling Luther to apologize, he didn't really care that much about it anymore seeing as it was last year, but he did explain his feelings to me, how he was scared, in pain, and felt bad about his body. I'm still upset that he didn't want to hold or properly meet the child he birthed, but I am happy that both he and Brent are over it and accept my apology.",

Last she came out and we found out she has been cheating over her husband with his best friend and bragging about it in her private social media. She also has a child with her husband.One day she randomly kicked husband out and their child telling him to get lost. She then moved her new girlfriend in. Husband payed more for the house. I let husband and mu grand son stay. I also told him we where going to sue.I made sure to tell this to my daughter and demanded her to give back the house to husband and move out other wise I will sue her. She screamed and yelled at me for being a bad father.I ignored and told her she can move out or we sue. She ignored and told me to fuck of. So i sued her and me and her husband won. We ended up winning and got the majority of property as well as keeping the child and making her pay alimony and child support which is half her paycheck.Today my daughter called me and begged for me to let her come home. I refused and asked you should stay at your girlfriends. She said girlfriend kicked her our because she wasted money.I laughed and said no because if her girlfriend was mean i would have let her stay. My daughter the.

	"body" : "My (19M) parents are strict about the ethnicities/races that we are allowed to date It is not because they are racist but because they want us to date people within cultures that are more compatible with ours, especially since our parents are immigrants.My  younger sister (17F) is a senior in high school and has a dance coming up. Over dinner last night, she was talking about how excited she was to go when my parents asked her whether she had a date. My sister said yes and they asked her what her date's ethnicity/race was. My sister lied and said that her date was white. Knowing that her date was not white, I corrected her and told my parents that he was actually black. This resulted in a big argument between my sister and our parents, and she is now grounded and no longer able to go to the dance at all.I talked to some of my friends about it today, and some people said I was an AH for exposing my sister's lie, but some took my side saying that my sister shouldn't have lied in the first place if she wasn't ready to face the consequences.So, Reddit, AITA?EDIT: looks like I have a lot of replies calling me and my family racist. I can assure you that we are not. My parents' cultural difference argument, in my opinion, is justified. We don't discriminate against other races and ethnicities at all. I know that both of my parents have co-workers and friends from many different backgrounds, and they do not treat them differently based on that. However, it is different for dating/relationships. Our relatives and others in our cultural community would treat us differently knowing there was a black person in the family, and that would lead to conflict between many people. It is more of a way of protecting ourselves rather than discrimination against other groups.",

This involves a family friend “Delia.” My mom lives out of state.For Christmas, I asked Delia if she could get me a vacuum since our old one was natty and disgusting. I sent her the link to the one I wanted. She curtly told me no because she already had my gifts picked out. I asked her if she could buy the vacuum as a gift for my dad instead then, since a new vacuum would be perfect for our house.She became even ruder and said she was not giving my dad a vacuum for Christmas and had his gift already. She got heated, I stayed polite. I was pretty upset at the rude responses but fair enough- I bought my dad the vacuum myself as a gift.When we opened our gifts. Delia had gotten me a bunch of stuff from some holy sites she went to on a trip abroad (I’m Catholic) and some headphones. It wasn’t exactly what I’d wanted, but it was nice. I thanked her.I gave Dad the vacuum and he obviously liked it.  Delia gave Dad some custom pins. He oohed and ahhed more than he did for my gift. I’m his fucking daughter.The big issue was over one small item Delia gave me- a rosary from a holy site in Europe. I already have 2 other rosaries. I thanked her but advised her I planned to give it away as I already have too many rosaries. I asked her permission to give it to my mom instead.She said it was my gift and I could do whatever I wished, but that maybe I should get my mom a different one since this one was for me. To be polite, I smiled and told her I’d look into it, but that I really wanted to give this one to my mom since I already have more. She shrugged and said okay.After Christmas, my dad found out about the vacuum and rosary and blew up pretty badly. Delia made a dramatic proclamation that she’s “tired of [my] rudeness around gifts” and doesn’t want to give me any more. I think maybe I could’ve handled it better, but Delia knew what I wanted, could afford it, and instead got me something I didn’t need. People regift all the time, and I was gracious enough to ask her permission.So AITA for this?EDIT: I get it guys, I suck. I’m the biggest asshole that ever assholed. I’ll apologize to Delia and no more gifts between us. Whoever reported me to Reddit Cares, you suck too.",

	"title" : "AITA for telling my friend that it's stupid and selfish to refuse to use effective birth control?",
	"body" : "My boyfriend and I live in a somewhat isolated/rural area, so we were excited when a couple around our age (late 20’s/early 30’s) moved close to us, and SUPER excited to learn that we shared a lot of hobbies. We’ve become really close with “Jeff” and “Jane” and have been spending a lot more time together, either in pairs or all together.Over the weekend our boyfriends were fishing together so Jane and I were doing some of our own hobby stuff the two of us (we both grow some really niche kinds of plants, though not the same kinds). The conversation was going and somehow sex came up, which lead to talking about birth control. I was stunned to hear Jane say that she doesn’t use real birth control AT ALL, just condoms and “cycle tracking”. When she saw my face she tried to justify this by saying that all of the kinds of hormonal birth control she’s tried give her awful side effects, and when she tried the non-hormonal IUD she had really horrible cramps ½ the time. I explained to her that those side effects (depression and loss of sex drive) are completely normal, that I take anti-depressants just to deal with the emotional side effects (my gyno says about half of women on hormonal BC do this) and I’ve had to teach myself to learn to be into sex and enjoy it even if I’m not in the mood at first. It’s stupid not to be on birth control just because it gives you side effects, all medicine can have side effects! As a woman you just need to power through, because condoms are significantly less effective, they’re just not the most responsible option.And it’s not just that it’s foolish to use a not super effective form of birth control when there are so many more effective options out there, it’s also pretty selfish to make her boyfriend use condoms and sacrifice his own comfort just so that she doesn’t have to deal with issues that pretty much all women have. Pretty much any man will tell you that condoms decrease a guy’s enjoyment of sex, if it doesn’t erase it completely. TONS of men have condom induced erectile dysfunction—my boyfriend included—so should they just go without sex forever? No, of course not, I don’t think anyone would say that, I think pretty much everyone would agree that it’s on those guys partners to use birth control.Although I was honest that I feel bad for Jeff and don’t think he should be on the hook if Jane ever accidentally got pregnant, I NEVER said that Jane is stupid or selfish, only that her decision in this regard is. I was clear that it was the decision, not her. Still she left upset and they’ve been dodging our attempts to get together since then.My boyfriend is totally on my side with everything I said, but is still upset with me for \"driving away our friends\" by not being more tactful. I thought my mom and sister would understand that I was trying to help Jane AND Jeff, but they both said I should have kept my mouth shut and let Jane make her own mistakes. AITA here?",

He did not have weekends or much rest since November.However, this March since I’m having a business trip to Dubai, I wanted to treat him and fly him over for a weekend to rest and relax and I asked him to take an extra day off. (Total 3 days). He said he would check.Today, while in bed, I reminded him again to confirm since I wanted to book a nice hotel. Also today I saw that his favorite stand up comic will be in town. So I asked him if he could take another day off, since we would need to stay an extra day to catch the show. (Total 4 days).He then started to sound agitated and annoyed. We talked back and forth as to what workload does he have to not be able to take additional days.I calmly and softly explained to him why this short vacation was needed and it was just for him to relax and rest a bit.To make it short, he finished the conversation in an ordering and angry manner saying “I can’t. Also this extra day, I’m 90% sure I can’t.”I turned around in bed and cried, because I was hurt that he is unable to see that I’m doing this for him. What bothered me more is that rather than sounding apologetic and sad he won’t be able to take a short vacay, he was very argumentative and annoyed and all he did was fight with me.(I did not need a vacation, as I’m a housewife who works occasionally). It was for him.So while I cried, he turned his back to me. Then he asked “Why are you crying?” I then told him “You’re being an asshole.” He got angrier, and I rephrased and said “You’re being a bad husband”.He got pissed I told him he was being an asshole and walked out and left me in the bed crying.Now I’m in the guest room, alone.

	"title" : "AITA For Telling My Wife To Drink Less Sweet Tea?",
	"body" : "My (28M) wife (27F) Anna and I have been together for five years, married almost two. She’s from the deep south, while I’m from new england. We were long distance for a year, during which she visited me and fell in love with my home state. When we moved in together, we agreed to find a place here rather that where she’s from. It was a big change, but she’s told me since that she couldn’t be happier. There were definitely adjustments she had to make (mainly to the snow), but we’ve made a pretty happy life together. Of course, being from the south, there were traits she brought with her that reflect that. I’ve always found these little differences to be endearing, and she’s expressed the same about me, but one of those traits has posed a consistent issue.My wife loves tea. She’s tried various teas over the years, though she’s partial to black teas. When it’s cold out and she’s staying in for the day, or if she’s unwinding from a long/hard day (she works 10-hour shifts), she sometimes makes a hot cup of earl grey and chills on the couch. In the summer, though, she drinks a lot of iced sweet tea. She’ll make a half-gallon for maybe 5-6 days and use an entire cup of sugar. I’ve had a number of friends and family experience issues related to, or developing, diabetes, and it was a huge concern that was drilled into me growing up. I had little sugar in my childhood and don’t do treats/sweets very much, but my wife has a huge sweet tooth. I’ve expressed my concerns before, but she says she has no family history of diabetes and only three cavities, and that until a doctor tells her she has something to worry about, she isn’t going to worry.We ended up fighting the other day because I asked her after her third glass of sweet tea to have some ice water instead. She said she’d have some water in a minute. I reminded her of her soda issue (borderline addiction) as a teen, and how bad it got during quarantine, and how I was worried tea was becoming her new coca-cola. She snapped at me about how she’d spent 6:00am to 5:00pm in a hot kitchen and that she deserved to relax however she pleased. I told her that yes, that’s true, but that I’m just concerned about her health, especially since she’s made such good strides these past few years expanding her diet and nourishing herself properly. She called me an asshole and said we both need some time alone and apart to think this over. We’ve barely spoken since then, mostly over text, and it feels tense in the house when we’re both there together.I was just trying to communicate my worries about her health. Was I an asshole here?Edit: This is about my wife’s HEALTH, not her weight. I do not care about her sugar consumption leading to weight gain. Before we met she was underweight and suffering an ED. I’m glad she’s gained some weight over the time we’ve known each other.",

	"body" : "AITA? My husband and I have a blended family. He has three children ages 12F, 9F, 6M from a prior marriage and I have two children ages 7F and 6F. The children from our previous marriages we share 50/50 custody with their other parents. So every other week, we have five kids. When we got married we wanted to have another child together, and about 3 months into our marriage I got pregnant. My due date is now two weeks away. My oldest stepdaughter (12F) wants to play school basketball and volleyball. She goes to school where her mother lives which is about a 30 minute drive (one way) from our house. So on normal days, that’s about an hour and fifteen minutes of driving in the mornings (his three kids go to two separate schools, the oldest is in middle, while the younger two are in elementary), then another hour and fifteen to pick up. So in total without sports we are spending 2.5 hours in the car every other week. If my step daughter does sports that will add another 2-2.5 hours in the car on practice days because you aren’t allowed in the school to watch them practice, there aren’t any close places for us to wait, and we don’t live close enough to drive home so we spent that time last year sitting in the car. Everyday is either a practice or a game day. So that would mean being in a car for at minimum 4.5 hours per day. So the very very soonest my husband would get home is 5:30 (sometimes closer to 8 or later if it’s a game night). Basketball and volleyball season (combined) will run around 6 months. We have no family close by, the closest family is four hours away. So since my stepdaughter wants to play sports at school every other week (when we have the kids) I will be the only person taking care of the household chores, our newborn baby, and my two children. All the stress will fall on me every other week. Not to mention I feel it is highly unfair as she is the only one that will be able to participate in any extracurricular activities since hers are so time demanding. I suggested her possibly doing basketball and volleyball at our local gym that offers those leagues as they only have practices and games maybe 2-3 times a week rather then everyday, but was told it was unfair to her to not let her participate in her school sports. However I feel it’s unfair that he is going to miss a lot of time with our newborn so 1 out of 6 kids can play a sport. AITA for even asking that my stepdaughter not play school sports, but rather play in the league offered by the local gym since we are about to have a newborn?",

She is smarter than me and has a great job and really just thriving in life.We weren't \"official\" at first for a few months and she only started introducing me to her friends about a month ago.First we went on a double date to restaurant with a gay couple, which was great. They were funny and awesome, just like my girlfriend. I didn't question in then.Then we went to a potluck with her friends and one  is in a wheelchair and another is so short they almost look like a child, like under 5 feet tall. Okay, still fine.Last week I met one of her co-workers she is befriending for brunch and also my girlfriend's brother came. I didn't know her brother only had one leg and wears a fake leg. Her coworker is trans, in early stages of transitioning.How does this fantastic amd thriving woman seem to only have friends who have struggles? I asked her if she has any friends that aren't disabled and she said, sure she does, so I just pointed out that I've never met them yet. She was a little irritated with me so I didn't go into too much detail about my observation so far. I did suggest that maybe she has low self esteem so forms relationships with people who are worse off than her so she can feel better about herself and talked about trying therapy. She didn't respond to me any more since that conversation except to call me a \"jerkface\" and it's been almost six days with only rare text responses from her that are mostly one word only.I think it was a valid point to bring up. She admitted to me she takes anxiety meds so I thought maybe she looks badly at herself and wanted to help lift her up. Her life is hard for me to understand but she won't talk me through it to help me understand and learn about it.I thought I was being supportive and nudging her towards support.

Ever since she was born I have proactively taken many lovely pics of my husband & our daughter playing together while he never had the sense to do it...so much so that I have less than 10 pics with my daughter in the first month of her life while he must have more than a 100. He also constantly asks me to take a pic with her every time he is holding her while I don't have anyone to ask to take a pic since when I am playing with my daughter, he is working. All of this has led to a huge imbalance in the number of pics he has with her vs what I have with her. Somehow while being the mom and doing all the mom admin, i always forget to click a pic with her and he never takes one proactively. However he always remembers to proactively either take a selfie with her or ask me to take a pic of them both. So he has a pic with her during all her significant firsts while I don't. I have also taken so many videos of them playing together and compiled them all together in a beautiful video which I gifted to him on father's day. I have been gifted no such videos nor had any proactive clip been shot of me with her. Today we took our daughter for the first time into london using the train. This was her first time using any form of public transport. This was a huge deal for me and I kept telling it to him. My husband dropped me and we went to the platform while he went to park his car. As soon as he came, he asked me to take a photo of the two of them. By the time I took the photo, the train had come but we still had a few seconds so I asked him to quickly take one of me with her before the doors open. He clicked one rushed photo and was like train is here..let's go. Later when I check the photo, it is all a blurred mess while his photo is so perfect (the one I took). I lost my shit & had an argument with him as to why he couldn't take a nice photo. He seemed to think I am making a huge deal for no reason and told me that he will take a pic as soon as we got off the train. I tried explaining to him that I wanted a picture of the moment before she first takes the train and he thought it's no big deal. It turned into a fight bcoz I was so mad at him for doing a shit and hurried job with my photo when I took such a nice photo of him and on top of that he didn't understand why I was so pissed. So I told him that since I now don't have a nice photo with her of this moment, and since according to him it's not a big deal and we can take a photo after we got off the train, I am deleting the picture I have of him with her so that neither of us have a photo of that moment. He thought I was crazy and I went ahead and deleted the photo. Since then he has accused me of being immature and childish.AITA for deleting that pic?Edit - added some context in comments",

My wife Maria (30F) is the youngest of four and the only one to not go to college. We married right after high school and I joined the military so she's been a SAHM to our three kids (now 10M, 8M, 6F).MIL/FIL want to retire early so they've been liquidating some assets. They wanted to make sure that my wife had no plans for college now that the kids are in school before using her college money for retirement.Here's where the issue lies: I think my wife's college fund is in the hundreds of thousands.  I also think it should go to our family. It was set up for my wife, everyone contributed to it thinking the funds will go to my wife and we are struggling. I'm out of the military and have a blue collar job now and with the high COL we are going into debt almost every month.When I brought up that point, my in-laws said they thought about it but are not gonna to give us any of the money. What they will to do is use it to support my wife and I going to college/getting certifications and getting good jobs so we can make more money. Neither one of us want to do this and we shouldn't have to when my wife technically has all this money for her locked up in an account.My wife wanted me to leave it alone and not mention it to anyone since she thinks its not her money and she won't use it for school.

	"body" : "My sister \"Katie\" married her school sweetheart \"John\" as soon as they were old enough to do so. She went and studied medicine while he joined the army.John finished his time in the army around the time their first daughter was born. Because he was unemployed while Katie was working, he stayed home with the baby while she went straight back.Fast forward a few years, and Katie is now a senior surgeon and head of her department. They've had a little boy and another little girl, and John still hasn't gone back to work, because Katie makes more than enough for the family.I'll be honest, I don't approve of this. I'm a SAHM to my two kids, and while I don't think all women should be, I feel happiest being a mum and don't think I'd enjoy anything else. My husband loves providing for us and I love taking care of them all. I don't really care about \"gender roles\" but I can't help but think John is taking advantage of her. He's a very fit and able-bodied man and learned lots of skills in the army according to Katie, so there's no reason for him not to be working rather than putting all the financial burden on her.I don't have much respect for a man who lets a woman who has just given birth go straight back to a complex and physically/mentally demanding job, as though her body hadn't already been through a lot. He could've just gotten a job for a few months and let her have some maternity leave so she could bond with her babies.We live quite close to them and our kids go to the same school. My kids have started asking why Uncle John doesn't go to work like their dad. I had to explain that different people have different lifestyles and we have to be kind and accept it. But I did tell them that this isn't right, and that a father should provide and protect his family like their dad does.They also asked why John has painted nails (he lets their daughters put makeup on him and paint his nails). I don't have a problem with this, but I recognize society does, so I said he and the girls were just \"being silly\".Unfortunately this got back to their cousins, who told Katie, who phoned me up shouting at me, demanding I \"keep my nose out of their business\" and saying her children wouldn't be playing with mine anymore.I'll admit that I shouldn't have said anything to the kids, they're too young to understand. But I told her that one day she would realise I was right, and that she's wasted her life with a man who has leached off her. She got even angrier, hung up the phone and blocked me on everything.AITA?",

He said that I always make him cancel his plans at the last second (false) and that I always just shove my plans on him and make him deal with them (also false). I told him he’s being childish and to just push the tour until tomorrow, I know for a fact that the landlord will understand and that it won’t be a huge deal. Whereas if my dad is left alone he could harm himself or others and that’s a much bigger deal.We ended up leaving, and he didn’t go to the tour and asked his fiancée to do it alone. He says she’s angry at him and he’s angry at us and now I’m angry at him for making it such a big deal. It’s really not that long, just a couple of hours.

Recently, he was able to qualify for state in one of his events. We were all happy, but me and my husband want us to make sure our son sticks to Islam, so we decided to not allow him to go to the meet nor drive him there. Our kid was quite pissed off, saying that this was a once in a lifetime opportunity but explained that need to do this as it would be better for him and his faithfulness in Islam in the long run.

	"body" : "I (32F) have 3 kids with my husband (32M), our kids are 13F, 9F and 7F. Our oldest daughter, 13F’s is named Romy. Romy has had some incidents at school recently and I have been called an a-hole for how I responded.At the beginning of the year, Romy ran for school president, she is a very smart girl and puts a lot of effort into her work and her extracurriculars, including theatre, Model UN, and film club, to name a few. Romy ran against a number of kids, and the winner was 6th grade boy, Brixton (11M). Brixton seems like a good kid from what I’ve heard from other parents, however, my daughter doesn’t like him, he’s on the basketball team and my daughter thinks he only won because he’s a “jock” and gave out custom basketballs with his campaign logo when running. I offered to buy my daughter merch, but she refused saying it was “unethical”, even though it was not banned by school rules.On Monday, I got a call from Romy’s school saying she had got in trouble for bullying another kid. I was horrified and went to the school to pick her up, she was suspended for 3 days. I punished her by taking away her phone for the duration of her suspension. The kid she bullied was a transgender boy, this boy is very close friends with Brixton. I told Romy that she needs to respect kids no matter their identity.Yesterday, I got a message on X/Twitter from Brixton’s mom. She said that Brixton tried to reach out to Romy and show her how “amazing” this boy was, and that he felt a responsibility as school president to make sure the school was accepting, she said Romy pushed him away and told him to “f**k off”. I said that I’d speak to her, but that Brixton was also inherently pushing her buttons by trying to speak to her as he knows Romy does not like him. She said that Romy should try to get over this grudge and I told her that she had the right to not like a kid or want to talk with them. It got more and more heated and eventually, she blocked me.After this, I posted to our school district’s community Facebook page to show how Brixton’s mom was overstepping her boundaries and that I worried Brixton would use his power to retaliate against kids he didn’t like, after getting some pushback for including Brixton in this, I edited the post to only focus on his mom.I didn’t want Romy to go to school today after this, so I took Romy on a girl’s day out. I wasn’t checking my phone during this, but now that we are back, I see that I have got multiple messages from other parents, saying that I should be ashamed of myself for “disrespecting” Brixton’s mom. I don’t think I did anything too wrong. AITA?",

Overall, they've both been great kids and never caused any trouble.Over the years, both have been dedicated students, but Jack has always been a better student than Peter, holding leadership positions in extracurriculars and performing slightly better on both the SAT and ACT.Lately, they have been filling out college applications. The expectation is that Jack will get into a better college than Peter.As a reward for being an excellent student all these years, my wife and I have decided to prioritize Jack's education over Peter's.We have two separate accounts with equal amounts of money that we've saved over time for each of them to help with college expenses. They still have access to this money.However, we've decided that when we contribute additional funds, our priority will be to pay for the best possible college for Jack, while whatever remains in our budget will go towards Peter's education.When we discussed this with them, Peter was furious. He argued that we've seen how hard he's worked all these years, that he has as much money as Jack, and that it's unfair to penalize him just because Jack is naturally smarter.INFO: Both want to go to Law School in future.INFO2: Peter has enough money in the saving account to probably cover most of the colleges in the country. The issue is that if both of them go to extremely expensive schools, then the extra amount I can contribute won't be divided equally.INFO3: We have a policy of no loans and we don't want them to work during college.

I was kind of annoyed and feeling awkward that my mum even spoke to her cos me and Magda stopped speaking under quite bad terms. My mum asked Stella how Magda is and Stella started going on about how Magda is a neuroscientist now and living abroad and really bragging.I said that I was surprised as she was kind of chaotic at school (and I didn’t mention but she was a couple of classes below me too). Then Stella asked me what I and my brother are up to now and I said I work in an office and also said what my brother does. My mum said how I got a promotion a year ago but Stella just returned the story to Magda and how well she’s doing.Stella said that she is going to go to the US to see Magda in a few weeks and that she is very excited as last year Magda was not able to get the time off work. My mum said that Magda must work a lot for that kind of job, and Stella started bragging yet again about all the stuff that Magda was doing. I said that that’s the fun with my office job, that it’s 9 to 5 and then I can go home. And looked at my mum to try to hint to her to wrap things up so we could leave, as it was mostly her and my mum talking anyway.But my mum then piped up and said that “yes, but neuroscience is a very impressive career so I imagine it’s not that easy to take time off”. I couldn’t hide my annoyance at that moment and I said that “it’s not really though, is it? Anyone can study and apply for that! (because it’s true). And Magda was right in the average class set at school so clearly anyone can do it!”My mum then told me that was ridiculous and the conversation kind of awkwardly shifted and continued for an awkward minute about other things before Stella said she needed to get going and left.When we got out of earshot I then had a go at my mum for talking to her in the first place. We’re not friends and I don’t think there was anything wrong with what I said. Stella just wanted to brag and my mum had no loyalty to me in talking to her in the first place.

	"body" : "My sense of  guilt says yes, but here is the context:I am an entrepreneur and I both work in and operate a small business  (15-20 employees) and a startup.  It is a very stressful job in an emotionally draining industry.  I also have 'side hustles' related to entrepreneurship.My wife is a stay at home mom and we have a 1 year old who thinks waking up after 6 am is for laggards.  My wife is an amazing mom who cooks, does groceries and most of the baby care and also gets up with the baby most mornings.We married late so well after the '7 days a week startup grind' phase of my career.  These days I usually go in to work for only 4x9-10 hour days per week (plus some weekends, plus some weeks I'm working 6-7 days but not often).  I also struggle to carve out time for the side hustles.  After work I help clean up a little, usually do the dishes after dinner and spend a little time with the baby.  However my 'me time' is essential to stress management so some days I'll just game or read in my office till midnight.  Then on days that I'm don't go into the office I need to sleep in as I've never been the sort to function on <6 hrs of sleep.  I spend at least 1-2 days most weeks with my wife and baby: going to pool, library, park etc.For added context we are definitely 'top 1%' income wise.  We live in a nice place, have a house keeper who does all the cleaning weekly and 20+ hours of nanny time with the option of having nanny stay the night once a month.The conflict comes from my wife feeling that we do not share our child care duties fairly.  Specifically she keeps bringing up how in 'normal couples' the man takes care of the kids 1 hr each day after work and 1 day out of every weekend, and she insists that it's unfair that she has to get up early with baby every day.  Note, she refuses the overnight nanny option (who will get up with baby) when offered because 'it's hard to relax with another person in the house' and refuses to let our baby spend nights with grandparents (which grandparents have offered). The only path to restful sleep is if I get up with baby. Also wife says she can't nap during day for... reasons.I've tried doing early morning 1, 2, even 3 days a week over the past year, but find it really messes up my days since I'm a night owl, so don't go to bed early and then have to function on 5 hrs of sleep.  Or miss my weekly sleep in/recharge.  Underperforming at work feels a lot like staring into the abyss since I'm the sole earner in our family and my businesses are my life and despite being relatively well established, they're definitely not too big to fail and I have a bit of residual anxiety from years of 'will I go bankrupt this month?' Lifestyle.AITA for prioritizing my coping strategies over my wife's needs? I'm cognizant of the fact that most weeks I have more free time than someone working 9-5 X 5 and will sometimes have 4 day weekends, but also, some weeks I  have a lot less AND I can get slapped with a stressful work situation literally any minute of any day.",

	"body" : "To make short of it, I went to use the WC while at work the other day and when I opened the door I was surprised to see a young lady, E(19?), a new hire from another department standing by the sink, I apologized and took a step back to double-check the sign on the door, but I was correct so I started back in when E rushed out passed me with their head down, muttering out a \"sorry\". I didn't think too much about this, I figured that there was something wrong with the women's, or maybe she'd accidentally gone into the wrong toilet. I thought this was a one-off.I'm fairly regular however, and I might have to go about 2-3 times throughout the workday E's presence has become a semi-regular occurrence, as it seems we have more than 1 overlapping schedule. The next time I saw E was 2 days ago, she was standing at the sink again touching her hair in the mirror but I didn't hesitate this time, I walked in and started straight toward the urinal to do my business. I think I made her scared because she hurried out again with her head down and her arms over her chest.I felt bad since I'm a fairly large man at 6'1\" and they can't be bigger than 5'6\", I'm aware I can be intimidating, and don't want to make anyone feel like I'm a threat to them, especially a woman who's in the men's! She shouldn't even be in there in the first place, right? At least not nearly as much as she is, as I saw her again the same day coming out of a stall, I thought about ignoring her again and just going to the stall, but my curiosity won, I said \"We can't keep running into each other like this, people get suspicious you know!\" trying to break the awkward tension, \"What're you doing here?\" I asked her. She said that she was sorry, that our manager had told her that she had to use the men's, I said that was ridiculous, and wanted to know why she'd have to do that.E just stood there, looking at the ground, then let out a long sigh before just asking me to move out of the way of the exit, of course, I did I didn't realize I was blocking the exit. E looked up at me on the way out with tears welling up in her eyes and said quietly that she didn't have a gender certification.I talked to our manager about this situation and she confirmed to me that E is a male and was asked to use the men's or neutral(?) WC to make the other ladies and customers more comfortable until they legally changed their records. I told her about my discomfort sharing a toilet with E, but she told me there wasn't anything she could do until E got a GRC.To be honest, this news was very shocking to me as I fully believed they were a biological female from birth, but I guess I haven't really spent too much time around them outside our bathroom run-ins.Now I've got another shift coming up with E, and I'm worried about meeting them in the bathroom again, would I be the asshole if I asked them to use the other bathroom, or to go at a different time, or maybe to dress a bit less feminine if they're going to be using the mens'?",

I get a good amount of attention from guys especially at prom for the past 4 years and I plan to work in the beauty industry.I have an annoying little sister, Laura (14F) who wants to be just like me. I hate this because Laura should just be herself, but she always wanted to be me. She kept trying on my clothes and using my makeup ever since she was a little girl. She even told me a year ago that she wanted to be just like me. The thing is that Laura doesn’t have any good fashion sense, she doesn’t take care of her skin, and she’s kind of overweight (5’1 and 150 lbs last I checked).I told her that if she wanted to be like me, she has to exercise and eat right, and to stop eating McDonald’s frequently like she always does, and to actually know color theory. I told her to try and dye her hair blonde, but then I said I know she isn’t going to do these things because she’s nothing like me and never will be. I thought that would make her back off, but she ended up getting really sad and she ran to my mom and kept asking why she didn’t let her be like me.Now our mother is pissed and thinks I’m trying to turn my sister into a spoiled brat and she thinks I have an obsession of feeling superior to her. I don’t. She’s a dorky 14 year old, I have no reason to try and put her down in a malicious manner.Was I an asshole here? My friends are saying that I was too mean. My mom is furious.

We get along well, have a lot in common, and he's a wonderful guy. However, there's one aspect of his family dynamic that I find extremely bizarre, and it's been bothering me for a while. I want to know if I'm in the wrong for confronting his sister about it during a recent family visit.Before my boyfriend's older sister moved out for college, she used to share a bed with him. They're 5 years apart, and this was a common occurrence in their household. My boyfriend had mentioned it offhandedly to me in some conversation, and had added that it was quite common in their culture. I, on the other hand, find this extremely unusual, and it makes me uncomfortable.There recently was a family get together since his sister(27) lives quite far and had come to visit for a few days. I couldn't hold back my curiosity and discomfort any longer, and I decided to bring up the issue.I approached her and asked, \"Hey, I've been meaning to ask you something, and I hope it's not too personal. I was told that you used to share a bed with your brother. Can you explain why?\"She seemed surprised by my question and slightly taken aback. She replied saying it was common in their culture, and also that there wasn't enough space anyways for separate bedrooms.I calmly pressed further, \"I understand the space issue, and  but it just seems strange to me. I mean, you both were well into your teenage years. Did you ever think it might be... you know, a bit inappropriate?\"My boyfriend's sister seemed quite offended at this point and kind of angrily replied, \"Absolutely not! We're siblings, and it was never anything more than that. We were just close, and there was nothing weird at all.\"I didn't want to come across as judgmental, but I couldn't help but share my thoughts, \"I'm sorry, but it's just difficult for me to wrap my head around it. I don't mean to offend you, but it makes me uncomfortable, and I needed to get it off my chest.\"The conversation didn't escalate further, but there was definitely some tension between us for the rest of the family function. My boyfriend later told me that I shouldn't have confronted his sister in that way, as it made her feel uncomfortable and hurt her feelings. He seems upset with me right now, although I'm sure I can get him to understand why I feel the way I do, given the whole situation is pretty weird.So, AITA for confronting my boyfriend's sister about their shared bed situation?",

Then, in grade 11, I bought her a blue graphing calculator that she can use for the next 2 years since it was required of her. She handled it and kept it in great care.She's now in university and she's taking math for one of her courses. Today, she sent me a link to the Amazon website for the pink scientific calculator, and told me that she's not allowed to use her graphing calculator for her class and she has a test next week. She asked if I can buy it.I asked her what happened to the scientific calculator that I gave her a few years ago. She admitted that she threw it away after getting the graphing calculator since she thought that she didn't need it anymore. I was shocked and disappointed. I told her that I won't buy it for her.She got upset and started begging, telling me that it was worth only $15, she'll be more careful, and that she was a stupid, impulsive sixteen-year-old who wasn't thinking straight. She promised to be more careful. I told her that she needs to learn from her mistakes and if she really needed a scientific calculator, she can just walk to the dollar store nearby and get one that costs only $3 at most on the weekend.We argued a bit more, and then she left, upset with me. After a bit, I think I'm making a big mistake by not getting her a second calculator since I think she understands her mistake and she has a test next week, but on the other hand, why should I buy it for her when there are cheaper options and she threw her old one away.",

When he was about 2 years old, his mother started getting into drugs and hanging around some bad people. I also didn't pay child support. I saw my son every few months. Because of all of this, her father decided to take in our son (63M).Her father says she's welcome to see Jack as long as he's present. To my knowledge she doesn't see him that much. Her father has basically disowned her. He says if she wants to get clean he'll help her but he doesn't want to feed her addiction.I started seeing my son, Jack, again about a year ago. He's also stayed the night at my house a few times. I see him about once a week usually and we've gotten pretty close. I tried to stay consistent with my visits but it's hard because i'm not used to this. I wanted to get custody of Jack because he's my son but his grandfather is saying no. He's saying that I can't even remember to visit Jack. Ill remember him if he's living with me though.He mentioned that I've gone 5 years without talking to him. Jack knew I was out there, he could've asked for my number if he wanted to talk, so obviously he didn't care that I wasn't in his life. Nobody ever tried reaching out to me so I feel like I don't deserve all the blame.I asked Jack if he would like to live with me instead of grandpa and he said he doesn't know. I reassured him that grandpa's feelings wouldn't be hurt but he said he likes how things are now. I feel like it would be best for him though if he was with his real dad. I feel like he needs some stability in his life, which I can provide. His grandpa can't even take care of him by himself, he has to have his sister watch him sometimes. I would always be there and no one would have to watch him for me. Also, he's 10 so most things he can do for himself. He can feed himself, bathe himself, and entertain himself.I feel like his grandpa is being selfish for not wanting me to be with my son.

I want to take Jacks feelings into consideration, but I also want to do what's best for him, even if he doesn't like it.

I also have a son (10) from a previous marriage, but I was widowed.My husband's ex is barely involved in stepson's life at all. They got divorced when stepson was 2, and his ex wanted \"a fresh start\" so my husband did the decent selfless thing and had complete custody of their son, even though he'd wanted shared custody.I got a bonus at work and I really want to go on vacation with just MY family JUST once. We've been on family vacations all together lots of times. But just once I want to spend MY money going on vacation where I'm not looking after someone else's kid. I want stepson to stay with his mom while we go on vacation. My husband sees my point of view and is okay with it. I don't think I'm being at all unreasonable.My mom found out what I was planning and says I'm being a complete AH. These are the reasons she says I could be the AH:My mom says that if stepson's mom isn't properly involved in his life, I should be even more involved in his life to compensate (I think this is a completely unfair expectation).She also says that I'm being a hypocrite taking my son, but I think that's totally different because my son DOESN'T HAVE ANOTHER PARENT. I'm all he's got.If stepson's mom won't take him just for once then obviously he'll come on vacation with us. But I don't think I'm the AH to ask if I can have a vacation with my own family just one time. It's not like I hate stepson or something, he's a nice kid, he's just not mine. Am I the AH?UPDATE:We definitely won't be going on vacation without stepson.After a couple hours of replies, I decided to show this to my husband. We sat down and had a really long talk about it. He told me he's never been comfortable with my attitude to stepson, but didn't know how to say to me before.I don't want to be a bad person, I just never thought of stepchildren being \"yours\". I don't think it would be easy for anyone to accept this level of criticism, but all your replies have shown me I have a LOT of work to do. As many of you suggested (and so did my husband) I intend to see a therapist to help me with that. As I said, I don't hate stepson in any way, I have never been deliberately cruel to him, I've just always thought of him as my husband's child. But I realize my mindset needs to change.So I'm going to start working on that. I want my family to be the best it can be, and I need to accept that it includes my stepson. I understand that now, and I'm going to start seeing a therapist to become a better person (we've also talked about maybe having family therapy too). I've also made up with my mom, and she is 100% behind the changes I want to make in my life.It wasn't easy to hear everything you said, but I understand that I needed to hear it.",

At some point in college, we became friends with Amber (F29). Not even a week after we met her, Mark decided that he was head over heels for her.Throughout college (and even after college), Mark asked Amber out regularly. Most times she would agree, but their relationship never really progressed beyond him taking her out to dinner or buying her gifts.Several of our friends and I told Mark multiple times that things would never go anywhere. But he always persisted that he didn’t mind that and that making Amber feel appreciated was all he cared about.Around the time we were 26, Amber got married (to Mark’s horror) and had a son (Ian, M2). Unfortunately, the relationship didn’t last much longer than 2 years. They ended up getting divorced back in January of this year.Since then, Mark has been helping out Amber a lot. He takes the Ian to doctor appointments, goes grocery shopping for Amber and Ian, buys the kid gifts on holidays, stays up with Ian when he’s ill, etc. During this time, he has also been taking Amber on dates regularly, but she has kept things from escalating further. I found out all of this a few days ago when Mark messaged me and our other friend Amir (M28), and told us all of this. (As an aside, Mark met another woman back in May, but they only texted for a few weeks. Mark broke things off because he thought it was making Amber feel jealous and uncomfortable).We met up to chat (at Mark's request), and Mark told us that he’s disillusioned and doesn't think he'll have anything with Amber and that she has essentially turned him into a “man-servant” in his words. He told us that he spent most of the last weekend buying furniture with Amber and then setting it up in her new apartment.He then told us that Amber’s going to be starting a new job soon and needs someone to pick up Ian from daycare, 3 days a week, for the next few weeks. He says that she basically implied that she wants him to do that, but he told us that he plans on rejecting her plan and then ghosting her.I told him that he probably should just pick up the kid and go along with Amber’s plan for two reasons. Firstly, with a new job and apartment it's already difficult enough with Amber being a single mother and second, Mark has already made Amber used to relying on him so much that pulling the plug seems needlessly harsh. He also is available during the pickup times.Amir then said that I was being dumb and that Mark had no obligation to continue helping Amber. Mark left shortly afterwards (Amber sent him a list of errands to run) and didn’t come to a decision. Once he left Amir told me that I was effectively guilt-tripping Mark by telling him he should continue to help Amber.I’m pretty conflicted about Amir's judgment.AITA?INFO: For everyone saying I should help Amber, I will not. This is non-negotiable.Also, I encouraged Mark back in May to start a new relationship, but he broke things because according to him, Amber was jealous.",

My sister’s fiancé told my mom to leave, so we left.I sent my sister a text explaining our side of things, and told her that she needs to think about her family too. My sister called me and told me that we are not “the victim,” and it’s “out of line” for me to tell her to think about our family when we were the one’s who acted selfish.I understand that my mom’s behavior wasn’t okay, but it’s built up anger from being left out of everything. If my daughter didn’t include me in any wedding planning, I would be upset too. I don’t know if I’m being an asshole for defending my mom. I’ve seen her hurt by all of this too long, so maybe I’ve lost the ability to see my sister’s side.",

	"body" : "I've known my wife (we'll call her Rachel) for ten years, and we've been married for four. During that time, I got a degree in nutrition and have been working for a local grocery store chain as a dietician. I'm keenly aware of what makes a healthy lifestyle because I stay current on nutrition research, and I even write diet and exercise tips for the store's customers. Rachael has gained a bit of weight over the last ten years, but that's understandable and natural, particularly because of her Hispanic ancestry. However, her mother (we'll call her Margaret) has really ballooned, and it's starting to put a strain on my marriage.Margaret was never thin, but she at least seemed to make an effort to eat fruits and vegetables and have smallish portions, until about two years ago. During the pandemic, Margaret lost some close friends, and it led to her barely leaving home out of fear. She also ate a lot. Rachael and I suspect that stress played a role, but as a grown woman, Margaret needed to recognize that she needed help. After she got vaccinated, Margaret was more willing to go out and do things again, but she has continued to eat a tremendous amount of food and food that isn't at all healthy.Recently, the three of us were out to dinner, and Rachael and I ordered entree salads. I also ordered a Coke Zero, which I know isn't a great option, but it has no calories, and I don't drink soda that often. However, Margaret ordered a burger and fries with a regular Dr. Pepper. Rachael and I were planning to tell Margaret that we intended to try to get pregnant soon, and this dinner was supposed to be a happy occasion, but I couldn't help but wonder how much longer Margaret would live if she kept up her bad dietary habits. Several of Rachael's aunts already have diabetes, so it clearly runs in the family.When the food came, I told Margaret this, and she seemed to get very offended, ignoring her risk factors, even though I laid them all out for her. I told her that perhaps she should seek counseling, but that, nutritionally-speaking, her diet would lead to an early grave. Relationships are not my area of expertise, and I wouldn't want to overstep. Margaret sulked and pouted for the rest of the evening, which was I thought was very childish, and Rachael kept trying to change topics, but I wanted an apology from Margaret because her doubting my credentials really felt like a slap in the face.A few days later, Rachael said that Margaret called her and told her that I had been a huge jerk, but all I wanted to do was help. Sue me for wanting my child to remember her grandmother! My wife is telling me that I should say that I'm sorry, but I think we deserve a huge apology from Margaret instead. I want my marriage to be healthy, but I don't want to be a total pushover. AITA?",

Before we started dating, I had known MH for 2 years, and right off the bat, we’ve been attached to each other.Earlier this year, MH sat me down to discuss something serious with me. She let me know that when she was very young (starting at the age of 11), she started hanging out with the wrong crowd. She got into legal trouble for non-trivial stuff. With all that said, the stuff she did was not evil, irredeemable stuff; they were just bad decisions and mistakes. She let me know that she is considered fully rehabilitated by the government, which is good. She made me swear that I would never tell anybody about her past, and that she’s opening up to me because I love her. I need to say that I did not agree to keep her criminal history to myself; I just told her that I would never do anything to hurt her.I have kept quiet about her secrets for much of this year…except in September, I had told my close friend and former classmate/graduate from my school, CC (27m) about my girlfriend’s past. CC works abroad now, and he’ll probably never meet MH, so I thought it was safe. So far there is absolutely no reason to believe that CC spread the word even further. Nevertheless, shortly after I let him in the loop, I began feeling indescribably guilty. So earlier this month, I met up with MH and, well, I told her that I broke my “promise” (I put quotation marks around that word because I hadn’t explicitly promised anything). I felt so ashamed, and I couldn’t control myself so I started crying. MH was livid. She told me that it doesn’t matter that CC would never tell anyone else. What mattered was that she told me not to tell anybody at all. She has now refused to come over to visit my parents and have Christmas dinner with us, and my parents are a bit heartbroken for me.AITA, if I had explicitly told CC not to spread the secret further, and CC agreed to it? I also have to mention that my girlfriend is slightly an asshole because she loves wearing this red jacket that one of her old criminal buddies bought for her.

He got it and she shouted \"NO! Not that!\" He put it back and kept grabbing different brands of the item, to find what she wanted and asking if that's what she meant.

I'm gonna ask that worker, he doesn't look like a complete buffoon.\"He apologized to her and asked if he could help her. She asked for a different product in the aisle.

He explained that creamy is all we have and the top brand is creamy as well. She told him to just get it, which he did. She didn't say thanks, she shouted \"This is creamy!

Out of the 30 kids in her class she ranked 29th.When I asked Maddison about these scores I tried my best to stay calm and not let my anger show.

I love them to death which is why I am feeling guilty about how last night went. But I am also hurt by them. I am a pre-med student. When I'm in school, my mental health worsens. I'm often physically ill too. I'm in therapy trying to learn coping skills but I don't feel like any of them will work. I don't have friends in my program so i don't feel like these friends understand how difficult med school really is. When they share with me how stressful their schooling is, I get frustrated for this reason. I told my friends about how I failed my first exam and how much it upset me. I cried it out with them. They listened. But when it was time for me to go home, something switched. I mentioned again how I was afraid of meeting my professor to look over my failed exam. My one friend said, \"I'm sure it happens to a lot of his students\" and the other said, \"we all fail an exam at some point\". Their words upset me to the point where I began crying again, yelling and screaming in the commons of their dorm room. I felt so dismissed by those phrases. I told my friend to \"fuck off\" and that she doesn't understand the half of what I've experienced in med school and what it’s like to fail.I know for a fact none of my other classmates failed the exam and I told my friends this already. I told them I feel like the stupidest student in the class. I didn't even fail because I didn't work hard enough. I failed in spite of working my ass off. I work 10x harder than any of my friends so it never feels fair. I know they had good intentions but it was a big trigger to be dismissed like that after all I’ve been through with my school and health.Another student filed a noise complaint and my friends got a demerit strike from their DA because they assumed it was only them. I live in another dormitory but I feel like I might have to take responsibility for this. They said in our group chat about how there’s a demerit for them. I have yet to respond. I feel as though I've made my needs clear but it doesn't feel like they're being respected and that they should not have crossed that boundary with me. I don't think I should get a demerit strike when I'm mentally ill and sick. I also feel like they could’ve let me know how loud I was being because I was literally so upset and can’t tell. At the same time, my conscience is nagging at me that I upset my friends with my rage and that they are in trouble because of me. Even though I wish I hadn’t gotten so upset, I feel as though I have a right to be when they know I don’t like to be dismissed.

We invited my MIL and FIL (60s) and my BIL's (30's), my family wasn't there as they live on the other side of the country. My MIL is a very standoffish and introverted person and does not care much for kids. My husband said that she only had him and brothers because FIL really wanted kids and there were different expectations for women 30 years ago. He says she never abused them and always met their needs but as soon as FIL was home and dinner was on the table she would withdraw from the kids. He says he never felt any deep connection with her and it hurts him deeply to know he doesn't have a 'real' mother.After dinner my husband stands up and makes the announcement and everyone is thrilled and MIL says congratulations but I can tell she is not as excited as everyone else. After dinner, MIL is helping him with dishes in the kitchen and I am wrapping and putting food away. I hear him ask if she is ready to be a grandmother and she just shakes her head and continues washing dishes. My husband walks out and I can tell he is close to tears. I get really angry and confront her in the kitchen. The argument begins with me asking why she can't be happy for us and she gets defensive and says she is happy for us cause she knows its what we wanted but she says she already raised her kids and doesn't want to be burdened with more. Things escalate from there and I tell she doesn't deserve her son's or FIL and that she is cold hearted for not wanting to be a mother or grandmother. I also say she should have tried to be a better mother. She gets angry which I have never seen before and at this point FIL and brothers are in the kitchen. She grabs her bag and keys and leaves with FIL. That night Hubs tells me he got a long text from FIL that says I was out of line picking a fight that didn't involve me and that I should apologise because MIL did nothing to deserve it. Hubs is near begging me to apologise because 'she is how she is and she is not a bad person for not liking kids'. I disagree with this because I know how much it hurts him and his brothers that she was never an emotionally available mother to them. I am also upset because my kids will not have a grandmother that they can see regularly and I am scared she will hurt them like hubs.

John’s been worse of with bipolar, OCD and very deep depressions.Tim met a girl/woman (Deena f40-isch) 15 years ago and she and him started out poor as all of us siblings but have built a good life with high paying jobs. Tim still struggles w/ mental health but much less than when younger. They’ve got an apartment and just bought a small country house a few hours away from where we live (not where we gree up)Tim and Deena have taken care of John on and off for ten years, supporting him finacially and letting him live with them in bad periods. A year ago John met a guy and they moved in together. This meant I could lend Johns apartment and finally leave our parents home. I have no job or income so Tim and Deena have been paying for it.Well now John and his boyfriend broke up due to abuse and stuff. John is staying with Tim but wants his apartment back, reasoning it’s his and he’s got a part time job and welfare so can pay for it.Tim and Deena said I could move in w them but I think thats a bad idea, they have cats that I don’t like and they are very… neat.

According to him she wanted attention but to me it seems normal to let someone know you got home safely.He said he started waking her up every time he was the one working late, but the tickling didn't really work and she was still doing it, so he used a super soaker with ice water and she hasn't done it since. He laughed and the man he was talking to laughed. Honestly it really bothered me and I'm a direct person so I told him that was abuse and doing that to his wife makes him an asshole and an abuser.He looked at me kind of confused and told me I was literally insane. The other doctor told me to lighten up and it wasn't a big deal. I simply stated I don't agree and I would dumb my BF for something like that. Alex then got annoyed and was like don't talk about my marriage. when he left the other doctor told me i went too far, that is such a loaded word, and he \"clearly adores her\"",

The first thing my gf does when she gets home is give her cats a couple of treats and she asks where the cat is, I had to be honest and I told her what I've been doing. She started crying because her cat is 16 and was paranoid that something might have happened to her. Which I feel bad about but I didn't have any ill intentions, I was trying to be nice and do what I feel is right for an animal(We ended up finding her in the garage shortly after this but after the fact, we got into a fight and she's barely spoken to me over the last couple of days)Most people that I've spoken to about this think I'm the jerk here, but I think it's silly and that she's overreacting.

We have one child already, and I'm 20 weeks pregnant with a second. My husband has been very supportive of this, and because he is quite well off, I can take as much time off of work as possible.The reason for this post is the fact that while growing our family is great and all that, one of the main obstacles right now is the car my husband has.  It's big I guess, but it's only 5 seats. I was thinking that by the time our second kids come, we could have a 7-8 seater car. The size hike would be convenient for us in my opinion. I talked to my husband about it, but he's not exactly on board with the idea. He thinks his current car is big enough for 4 or even 5 people. I can see why he might not want to trade in, given that he's only had for 3-4 ish years, and he only paid it off about a year ago, but I proposed the idea of just trading in. With the car that he has, buying any full size SUV will go for about 15,000-25,000 after the trade-in value.The discussion turned into more of an argument, and one thing led to another to the point where I said that he doesn't seem to care about me or my future kids wellbeing and I left. I didn't actually mean what I said, but I was just really upset.AITA? I don't think im that wrong for my ask",

I shockingly enough ended up looking at baby clothes even though we are fully stocked. I just can't help myself. My husband had gone over to grab some laundry detergent and bleach while I wandered the racks. After he came over we continued to go around the store together making sure we have everything and can avoid a store for the rest of the week since I was there was a possibility of going into labor any day now. It's also just a few days until Christmas and I have three other kids at home so obviously plenty to do. Today is my kid's last day of school so it was a now or never kind of deal for us.After we grabbed all of our items we headed for the check out area we realized we could get out of the store faster by using the self check out based on there only being 3 cashiers open and the lines being several people deep. The self check out line only had one person in it so we lined up behind her. After standing there for a few moments, and older woman, maybe late 50s early 60s got in line behind us. She commented about my pregnancy and asked when I was due. I told her any day now. She then proceeded without my consent to try and touch my belly. I took a step back and told her I wasn't comfortable and to please not do that. My husband got between us while she called me selfish and ungrateful. I do not know this woman and have never seen her before. Jason told the woman that I was uncomfortable and it was my belly so it was my decision who I let touch me.When I say this woman blew up at the both of us it's an understatement. She began yelling and screaming obscenities so Jason and I made the decision to leave without buying anything and going to a different store. She followed us out of the store and kept yelling. I was scared and didn't want to go to the car knowing she was following us. Jason stayed between me and this woman the entire time and handed me the keys to the car. The woman called out to me ask I walked away again that I was a bitch and she hoped my baby and I both died in labor. I lost it and against my better judgement yelled at her and told her she needed to learn that the world doesn't revolve around her and her feelings and not to touch anyone without their consent. I was furious.When we got home I texted my mom telling her what had transpired and she told me I should have just walked away rather than being an asshole to a stranger \"this close to Christmas.\" I told my mom that my job as a mom is to protect my kids and I felt that I was doing just that. She sent back a long paragraph about being the bigger person and respecting my elders. I've not responded but am now questioning my reaction to the ordeal and feeling like I may in fact be the AH.",

I reminded her that morning that she'd need to pack a lunch, and she eventually made herself a sandwich and packed a banana. We were at the boat pier when she spotted a kiosk selling coffee and sandwiches: I bought us a couple of coffees. She spent £6 cash on a sandwich and ate it right away.

He was always fascinated by knights so he had a natural inclination towards HEMA. He has been doing it for ~4 years now and he absolutely loves it.With the second, Klara(f11) it was a bit of a struggle to find something she gravitates towards, but she was exited to try different options. She tried swimming, football, fencing and eventually settled on basketball last year and has been enjoying it since.Now the issue is the twins Jake(m8) and Abbie(f8). Abbie absolutely hates the idea of trying out sports and Jake has this general disinterest. And the issue is exacerbate by my wife.I spent about 6 months trying to educate them on all the different options. Jake only showed some interest to boxing. I was ready to sign him up but then my wife(f44) insisted that the twins go to the same sport. So we waited until both Jake and Abbie could agree on one and they chose tennis.Well this week they went to their third lesson and... again Jake was apathetic.

It just made her throw a fit, she doesn't want to go anymore, period.The issue comes with my wife. She never saw any benefit towards having the children start sports at such a young age. She says they'll have a life time ahead of them to start a sport just like she did. (she only started volleyball at 17)Now that there is a bit of opposition, she insist I stop pushing Abbie into doing something she doesn't want to. That I don't care about her feelings.

I can't drive yet, and she usually drives me to college and my younger brother (13M) to school every morning. The drive is about 20-30 minutes. She said she was planning to go there for a little over two weeks, which happens to be over the holidays and cuts into a week of the new semester. This would mean our father would have to drive my brother to school for a week until she comes back. Since my father works full time, I suggested she could shorten her visit to around 10 days to avoid disrupting our routines so much. This would allow her to be back in time to resume driving us when the new semester begins. However, my father would have to adjust his schedule and potentially take some time off to be able to do this. When I told my mother that this might be too disruptive for our family's daily routines and that she should probably shorten the trip a little, she got really upset and said that I was being selfish, prioritizing my convenience over her opportunity to see her dying father one last time, although I only asked her to cut her trip short a few days, and still go for 10 days instead of 14 - 18. She hasn't talked to me since then, and it's causing a lot of tension in our house. So, Reddit, AITA?Edit: To add more context, there's no other family member nearby who can help us with transportation during the mornings. Also, my father's job is not the flexible type. He has a large role that requires him to be at his job otherwise he'll interrupt operations in his company.Edit: My brother suffers from autism and social anxiety, so even if my father did take time off from work, he wouldn't know how to handle my brother, as my mother takes care of him most of the time.",

Then, they started demanding apologies because, in their opinion, I'm constantly addressing everyone's mistakes, and that I never address them in a good way.I told them that my question was genuine and I wasn't trying to be rude, but they just started saying that I just asked to mess up with them because 'there was no way for my question not to be interpreted as bad-mannered since there were no indications to think otherwise' and 2 other people had interpreted my message the same way (kind of trying to pull an ad numerum to me, even when they didn't even make a majority of all the people that were involved?). I also told them that maybe I wouldn't have been so persistent if they had just answered the question instead of constantly changing their words and straight up insulting me when they couldn't or didn't want to keep defending their point.So, AITA for not feeling responsible about the way they interpreted my question and thus not apologizing?P.S. English is not my (nor any of my friends') first language, so I'm sure some things in the post may end up being confusing. Also, note that I'm, in no moment, referring to typos; I don't go around correcting everyone's typos because I understand touchscreens and keyboards aren't the best at avoiding them, and I know how to interpret them if I have enough context to do so.Edit: Tried to clarify what I tried to say because some people told me they didn't understand what I wanted to convey. Also, to everyone calling me a hypocrite for not making a perfect use of English as I claim to, maybe you're just assuming it and missed the P.S. where I clearly state that English isn't my first language and that I'm aware that not everyting I wrote in the post would be perfect. Or maybe you missed my first few sentences where I say 'I try to be as precise as possible', not that I'm perfect and never make mistakes. Willing to discuss the topic in my first language, though ;)Edit 2: To everyone in the comments calling me out for criticizing my friends when they make mistakes while not being able to handle being told that I'm wrong: I have no problem with being corrected (I'll defend my point until proven wrong, though), I'll just correct myself or move on. My problem is when they straight up insult me when they run out of explanations and say I only talk to them with bad manners.Edit 3: Update here.",

She loves our kids like her own, buys them gifts, just goes above and beyond, which made this decision hard. Today, around 3am, our kids woke up extremely sick. Throwing up and diarrhea. They were completely fine before. After hours of comforting I went to the kitchen and saw the naan bread we buy was expired. As was the bread, tortillas, and beans. I texted the nanny asking everything they ate the day before. They had eaten bean and cheese tacos and naan and bread for a snack. I snapped at her for feeding my kids expired food. She was upset and apologized but said she didn’t know and wouldn’t have assumed because we (my husband and I) ate them too. She then said it wasn’t her responsibility to make sure nothing was expired, considering we get groceries every Monday. She was blaming us for our babies being sick. I told her not to bother coming in and that I need to seriously think about her employment. I could hear her crying and she hung up. Now an hour ago I made the decision to fire her and texted her so. She just asked about how the kids were doing . My husband is calling me unreasonable and so is my MIL and sister. AITA here?",

	"body" : "I am a college student and I go to a massive university. I took a break from my schooling to take care of physical and mental health matters, and elected last minute to return to my course work this fall semester. This posed a very large problem as my college town is currently dealing with a housing crisis and shortage, so I basically had very little options to where I could get a place to live 5 days before classes started (not joking).I got my cat 3 years ago as a dumped Craigslist kitten and she is heavily, heavily bonded to me. She has lived with me all through university, surrounded by many young adults, as well as when I took my hiatus from school. I struggle with documented mental health issues, and she is my certified emotional support animal (ESA) and not a pet. She is my one sigh of relief and functioning without her around is difficult.So after desperately cold calling leasing offices and agents I finally found a place that answered me and met some of my needs/ budget... and they had a single opening. All I could see about my roommates is that they were \"dog friendly but not cat friendly\" as a roommate had a documented allergy to cats. With school starting in a matter of days and me having no other options, I signed the lease. The leasing agents told me although this girl I would be living with is allergic to cats, I can still bring my cat because she is an ESA and I cannot be denied, but it's up to m- if I want to cause potential roommate issues. The suggested that maybe I don't bring her up right away and talk it out with them once I get to meet them all and live with them for a bit. My room is also on the smaller side and it would not be fair for her to be shut in there all day everyday.Upon moving in with these 4 other girls, I learned that I would be living with a dog. It was a different roommates animal, but it's a miniature poodle which is hypoallergenic. According to the roommate with the cat allergies, she is \"quite allergic\" and because of that her family also only has poodles. Here's the big issue now. My parents offered to watch and take care of my cat for me while I navigate this situation, and I am very thankful for that. However, my parents have 6 cats of their own.... And they absolutely do not get along with my cat. My parents, one being an ex veterinarian, have tried just about everything from calming collars to like Jackson Galaxy type stuff and it's just getting worse. I also think her and I being separated is causing her massive anxiety ad it's just not fair for her.TLDR: AITA for bringing my ESA cat into my apartment even though one of my roommates is allergic",

Just a little annoying thing : he always challenge himself to learn new things, the kind of guy who one day  decide to try to learn piano, or a new language or read all the books of one author and usually succeeds. Actually he doesn't pressure me to do anything nor neglect me or the house.. But I don't know, sometimes I feel exhausted living with him.Last year, I wanted us to move closer to my family and before getting engaged, Tom insisted on really getting to know my family. I love my family but I was wary because they hated my previous BF. Turned out I was wrong, they all adore Tom, even my overprotective big brother told me he's the one. My dad and Tom goes running together (they proposed me to tag along but I don't like it) and even talk about doing a marathon next year.This month, I took a 3 weeks vacation to travel a little. Tom wanted to tag along but I wanted some  needed me time, he was sad but accepted. I wasn't always on my phone during the trip but I saw Tom spent quite some time with my family. My SIL got a promotion and celebrated it at a restaurant with my family, I was surprised to see Tom there. My mom even added him to the Whatsapp family chat. I know SIL is in it as well as spouses of cousins but imo it is a bit much. An interaction in the group that really pissed me off was when Tom shared some home improvement stuff he did, my brother asked if he didn't feel too lonely at home and he responded « nah mate, living the dream lol » then tagged me and say «  when the cat isn't here, mouse dance » with lol emojis. I felt like he was mocking me.Moreover, he took a liking to my sister (F19), she is in year 2 of med school. Tom is a resident in pneumology and is becoming a rôle model for her. He helped her with classes a few times and when I was away, he even managed to get her to attend some consultations and surgeries.When I came back, I confronted him to tell I wasn't happy with all that. He apologized for the joke and told he didn't want to upset me. I said that he's too intrusive with my family and should leave sister to fend for herself with her studies just like I did. He disagreed strongly and said while I'm his no1 priority, there is nothing wrong with building a good relationship with my family and he is just helping a fellow med student to discover her future job. I got angry and left the conversation.I told the story to my bro, he said I overreacted and create problems by myself. My parents say I'm ridiculous and should be happy for my sis because she greatly benefits from Tom's guidance. My friends side with Tom too.I'm torn about all this. Am I the AH ?",

Not the most ideal because my brother is not responsible with taking care of children, him and his partner don't have any kids themself, but we had to make it work and my brother doesn't work so he has time that our other family does not.Now he’s been calling me constantly wanting to get them off his hands. First he was complaining he didn’t know anything about how to bring them to school, the kids know when school starts they just need to be driven. They can do their own homework. And I’ve told him I’m dealing with an emergency but he can’t make himself understand that. With him it’s only ever about himself… he’s told me numerous times about his flight on Wednesday and is threatening to ABANDON the kids with CPS if I didn’t come and get them… but my husband had MAJOR SURGERY last week! I told my brother he’s constantly in Spain so he can just wait here for a while like an adult where he’s needed, and it’s not like he can’t change his ticket, its such an easy thing to do.He told me that I’m “seriously unhinged” over this! I just don’t see it, how am I in the wrong here? What happened to family sticking together and not leaving each other in their darkest moments?Since you asked my kids are 11, 9, and twins are 7. They are responsible and respectful. They just need an adult present and to drive them to school and activities.Also for those concerned about my kids safety making me out to be a bad mother... my brother would never harm them. He just doesn't have kids so he doesn't understand everything they need. And he has trouble being consistent with going places and canceling plans because he doesn't feel good anymore, that's all.Oh, and it's not a vacation, they live half the year in Spain. So it's ONLY the plane ticket thats needs changed, not like he also has hotel, etc. to move around...For one last time I'll just say this... my husband needs to rest. I did make sure my kids are SAFE so he can rest. I worded myself poorly, it's not as though my brother is a monster, my kids are SAFE and fed and housed... the \"not responsible\" part I meant was my brother can't always get things done and gets easily exhausted with just things like grocery shopping to where he decides he's done for the day.

He came storming over, red-faced, and started shouting about how I had disrupted his afternoon nap and turned our neighborhood into a circus.He accused me of being inconsiderate and called my idea \"a special kind of crazy.\" He even threatened to report me to the homeowners' association for causing a disturbance.

Anyway, to keep this story as short as possible- I asked a friend with severe allergies to give me a hand with something, to which she was reluctant as her allergies were acting up that day. I didn't want to push her if she didn't feel well enough to go, but I kept my optimism and told her that tomorrow is a brand new day and that she might feel better. Her response, however- was pretty agressive. She attacked me saying that i don't know a thing about her health, which is true but I don't think she should have reacted so strongly. After a bit of bickering, she told me that i was 'living life on easy mode', to which I've pointed out my years of struggling with mental health- to which she said that 'its funny how you think you're the only one with anxiety'. I should point out that I've been friends with this person for over 9 years and I'm good friends with her mother. This person does have adhd but NOT anxiety. She has trouble focusing and taking mental health seriously, but again- not anxiety.

I was at my wit's end by this point, and me and my boyfriend decided to take the chihuahua to the local animal shelter.

Ren is married to Helga (35F). All 3 of them went to the same high school together so they have known each other for more than 20 years and are pretty close.Now the part where I may or may not be the AH…I dislike Helga. Not for any bad reason, but only for the fact that I always think my fiancé Wil, would have liked it if I would be as successful and financially literate as Helga. In short, I fall short in comparison to this lady. Helga is from a poor family and she has clawed her way up.I have made a few bad financial decisions before that have caused a few problems along the way. Yes, bad debts, credit cards, and the likes. Wil has been very supportive of me trying to make these problems go away by teaching me how to better handle my finances. I am still a work in progress but I do my best. I am getting there.Helga on the other hand, is a career woman, and I can tell she calls the shots in her marriage. She is frugal which may be the reason why she and R own several investment homes and a few stocks here and there at our age. I know this because Wil has asked them for financial advice sometimes. I am very happy for Wil to have friends like them who are successful and someone he can look up to.The reason why I don’t want to invite Helga is because I am uncomfortable that she may be judging us on our wedding. I admit that we may have overspent on our wedding budget. We have had help from our parents but we still ended up borrowing to finance the rest of the expenses. Ren and Helga know this because we have borrowed a portion of the money from them. We will pay of course.Wil thinks I’m crazy that I would prohibit him from inviting R’s wife who also happens to be his friend. He reminded me that these were the 2 people that have actually saved us both a couple of times by letting us borrow money when we are tight and for offering their home to us when we were kicked out of our rental a few years ago.My reason for not inviting her is I want to be comfortable in my wedding. Not having to worry about other people judging my financial decisions. Plus, Helga and I never really vibe. She is too different.

He has respectfully declined. Now my fiancé thinks that their friendship will never be the same again after this.I say it’s my wedding and I should have a say on who gets invited. So, AITA?",

I agree that he does and it’s benefitting him now, but arguably, he’s going to age much faster than I do. When we’re around my parents age, he’s going to look decrepit, and assuming I age like my mom, I’ll look great.I told him so and he got angry and called me TA.

She jumps on her desk at the sight of even the tiniest spider, and everyone in the office knows it. So, of course, with Halloween coming up, I thought it would be hilarious to play a innocent prank on her.I found some pretty realistic fake spiders online and bought a whole bunch of them. Over the course of last week, I strategically placed them around her desk, in her drawer, on her chair – you name it. At first, she was startled but brushed it off. I thought it was all in good fun.However, I think I may have gone too far today. So instead of just one of two, I decides to put a whole handful of the spiders in Lisa's desk drawer. I guess this was too much for her, because when she opened the drawer, she screamed, started crying, and had a full-blown panic attack. I immediately rushed over to explain it was just a prank, but the damage was done. She's genuinely traumatized by the experience, and now she won't even look at me.My other coworkers say I went too far, and I feel terrible about how scared Lisa got.

	"body" : "Visiting my parents in South Korea (I live in Australia, used to live in the US for college years, but I grew up in Korea so I'm a full blown Korean, I'm not really a tourist here, more like expat visiting home country). Me, my wife, my dad, and our 19 month old son in a restaurant, we order food and while we wait, my wife takes out about a half of a scone that was purchased from a nearby bakery earlier. As she breaks a thumbnail size portion for our son to munch on, a male employee approaches our table to tell us: “food from another place can not be consumed in the premise” We ask again if he wants to stop feeding our baby the scone, and he confirms we are not allowed to feed the scone to our 19 MO because it is food from outside, regardless of the size or type of the food, then walks away. In my previous experience (although limited to Australia), when we walk in, we are asked if we need high chair/baby plate/fork, and no one really pays attention to what we feed our baby, which is either a baby pouch meal from grocery stores or a homecooked meal in a small glass tupperware. I began to wonder: \"Who asks for a restaurant's permission to feed a morsel of baked goods to a baby while waiting for the food?\"“If a baby gets hungry while waiting, parents usually feed milk/baby food, but if that is prohibited, baby will likely cry/throw tantrum, which is nuisance to other customers, so what? Just walk outside and feed your externally sourced food to your baby and when the order is served, come back in and proceed to feed ONLY the food from the restaurant to the baby?”I complain to my wife that the service is unacceptable, a waitress approaches to ask what is wrong, and I clarify whether the man who asked my wife to stop feeding our son was the manager or a waiter. My voice must have been loud enough so my wife tells me to lower my voice. Manager notices this and returns to us, gives us a lecture on why the company's policy needs to be enforced for cross contamination reason. My wife asks to elaborate on cross contamination bit and manager suddenly talks about a possibility of a customer wrongfully accusing the restaurant if he/she gets food-borne illness from consuming food from outside. My wife says we won't hold your restaurant responsible for any potential foodborne illness, and the manager walks away again. As my dad was running out of his lunch break time(he slipped out from work to dine with us), we ate there instead of leaving. I asked the locals here (some parents and some non-parents), some say it is my fault for not checking with the restaurant’s policy and permission before whippin out the half scone. So was I the asshole because I got upset and raised my voice to the staff? or was the manager the asshole? I'm also curious to know what the usual go is ('d love to know what country/region) when dining out with a baby and feeding them baby food sourced externally.",

He has a full size fridge right next to him, he apparently pees in bottles (god knows who empties them) and does not move. At lunch time he plays video games, after school he watches YouTube until his friends from overseas come online and then he plays more games until he moves 2 feet to his bed at 1 am to repeat the process at 7:30 the next morning.

His room looks like a very bad episode of hoarders and it smells worse.I tried to talk with him and he ignored me so I asked him what it would take to get him to take a shower and leave the house. He said there’s a Lego set he wants. I said fine, if he got cleaned up and at the very least got the trash out of this room I would take him to get the Lego set.

We are still working on building the set and hope to finish by sisters return on Friday.Well my sister saw her bank app and went nuts.

While I have multiple sisters, we are not close in the slightest like he is with his sister. Having the conversations he has with his sister with my sisters would make me really uncomfortable, and we’re the same gender.I think a lot of it has to do with their mom, who had really bad depression growing up and is now in a mental hospital. She wasn’t really active in their lives, same with their dad who passed, so my bf and his sister are the only family they have.They talk a lot about growing up together, and his sister had said she misses it (even with the neglectful mom) because her and her brother were together 24/7 and those were the “good times”. Like huh?She is normally in college, but currently staying at his place for the break. She came out of the bathroom and says to him, “I almost ripped myself open.” He said, “What happened?” She said she accidentally put in two tampons and they both came out side by side which was really painful. She said she almost shed tears, it was that bad, “maybe I have vaginitis or something because ouch.”To which he laughed and said, “oh god, you’re okay though? You don’t need a doctor?”Like okay, I don’t know how he takes that so well. If my sister said that to me I’d be like ew, tmi, and also who asked? Why did you just share that with me?Later, she said there was a boil on her breast and was claiming that she had breast cancer and was going to die. He said let me see and she showed him.I offered to look instead but she said no, sorry, I’d prefer to show my brother. She literally covered herself up so I can’t see. She has no problem showing her brother her boob but dear god if I catch a glimpse.Anyway he said it actually wasn’t that bad and she insisted that it was, but was too scared to go to the doctor because of course.But yeah, I’ve mentioned how close they are to him before and he agreed. He says yes, she’s my favorite person. He frequently calls her a “baby” and I point out she’s only 4 years younger than us but he insists she’s a baby and I wouldn’t get it because I’m not close with my family like that.But it doesn’t have to do with closeness. It’s about respect for your family, and being classy. She comes off trashy with how she speaks around him.I went to talk to her and told her that I know her and her brother are close but she shouldn’t say that kind of stuff in front of him. She said I didn’t get her family dynamic. She said I was conservative and weird about nudity/sex, but they aren’t like that and are open with each other. She said her brother shared all his hookup stories when he first experimented in HS, it’s not a big deal to talk about sex, periods, etc. I said listen, sure, you can think that is okay at 15, but now it’s not, you’re both adults, so stop. There is no need to overshare.AITA? She seems annoyed at me.Edit: I’m not breaking up with my boyfriend. I talked to his sister to help them have a healthier dynamic, like most siblings do. It did NOT come from a place of insecurity or jealousy like people are implying but because I know their history and wanted to help. I’m more worried about him finding out and being upset with me lol.I did not realize people on reddit were so open with their family about their bodies/periods, etc. It is extremely odd to me, but I do get that different people have different dynamics. His sister is also bi, and gay people tend to be really open about their bodies, sex, etc, so that might also contribute to it.Also she will go to a doctor.

We text during the week and go on dates during the weekend. She usually stays one night or so per weekend at my place. I never go to her place. I have never met her son and her son doesn't know I exist. One of those types of relationships if you want to call it that which I am fine with. We both work a lot during the week and I like having my own house to myself.Her son is 17 and will be 18 in three months. He gets good grades, plays sports and has absolutely nothing wrong with him. My GF parents' bought him a very nice car when he turned 16.My GF parents' are retired and borderline rich and take the son to a private school 20min away every morning and pick him up every evening.This is in rural southern USA. There is no uber, doordash, lift any of that. If you need to go somewhere you have to drive. The closest gas station is a minimum of 4 miles away.I am 38 years old and had a dirt bike and atv when I was 11. My only rule growing up was be home before dark. Which I obviously grew up in a different world than we have today.Argument:This started innocently enough. My GF had a rare break at work for a few days and her parents told her to take her son to school instead of them. She was complaining about getting up a 6am on her day off when I chimed in that her son is about to be 18 and had his own car that he should be driving himself to school.Her: He's not ready to start driving he says he is uncomfortable.Me: Well that's normal for a new driver. The way you become comfortable is by driving. Has he had drivers education at <insert private school>?Her: Oh that's an elective and he says he isn't taking it.Me: Well driving is a very important skill that everyone should learn. The sooner he starts the better, he is already behind.Her: He is not behind! Driving is not a requirement. I don't care if he ever learns how to drive. I am not going to force him to do anything that makes him uncomfortable and dangerous.Me (flabbergasted): Um being uncomfortable is a normal feeling when learning new skills. Driving is an absolute requirement for adults. What if he needed to rush you to the hospital?Her: That's what ambulances are for! Besides you don't have kids and have never raised kids so what would you know?!Me: This is true I haven't, and I grew up in a different time and era. I am entitled to my opinion though and I think we need to agree to disagree and drop this subject for the evening.That was pretty much the end of it. We dropped it and continued on with our normal date. I could tell she was irked by my comments but I avoided the topic. A couple days later she told me she had to drop her son off for a DATE?! before she would be on to my house. I shuddered and told her I would see her soon.",

Better yet, go give it to your fucking boyfriend because he clearly needs you and the booze more than I do.\" I tried pleasing my case and she said \"either leave or I fucking will\".

We are constantly buying more and more plants, and I think we have about 20 now.We have been living together for 20 days.

Not surprising for them, and I'm not surprised neither of them have anything either.Janet asked if I agreed, and I just said that while they were way too extreme and you can't treat people badly, I probably would be hesitant to date someone I just met now and reluctant to have a relationship the way I always have with my wife because at this point I've actually built something to lose, and yeah, I wouldn't actually know that person as well or be able to.

Unfortunately, she got a splinter deep under her nail yesterday and after not sleeping because of throbbing pain, she asked me if I thought she should go to urgent care in the morning or go on a run to stick to her training and see a doctor later. I told her to go early since it hurt so bad, and that I would go with her. We live in a city so I went to her house and the ran together (short, easy run).I waited ~1 hour and when she came out she said it was a brutally painful procedure (8-9/10 pain). Then I asked her about pain at the moment and she said 1/10. Thinking she felt fine and trying to distract from the horrible experience, I asked if she wanted to run home. She said she was worried about sweat falling where they removed the nail, but I said given doctor instructions that should be fine.She then said I was extremely gaslighty and devoid of compassion because instead of giving her a hug and comforting her, I asked her to run home. Rather than feeling comforted by her boyfriend, she said I made her feel like a wimp for not wanting to run home and that I made the situation worse.I tried explaining that based on how I understood the situation (I.e., strong desire to run that day, 1/10 pain, etc.), I thought distracting her and carrying on with normal life would be the best path vs. showing more compassion. I told her now I understood why she felt that way and that I could’ve shown more compassion, but that she shouldn’t be mad at me because I wasn’t a dick, and I wasn’t trying to gaslight her - I simply thought a different course of action was best.She said that she understood my actions but that no one in their right mind would act that way, and she said that my hyper-logical brain did not lend itself to being a supportive and caring boyfriend.At this point, I should’ve just hugged her and said sorry given she was in distress about the morning events, but instead I got quite defensive and ended up walking away, making what would’ve been a nice gesture of going to the doctor with her the opposite. AITA?Edit 1: To answer questions, the nail removed was a fingernail in her hand, not her toe. Also, when she mentioned the sweat, I asked her about doctors instructions for washing hands, etc, and the doctor said that it could get wet.Edit 2: The following argument wasn’t about me pushing her to run after she said no - I quickly understood she didn’t want.

I grew up playing on my PS2, have always loved their exclusive games, and constantly play my PS4 at our apartment even today.I made my love for these games and consoles exceedingly clear to her and occasionally talk her ear off about them. Unfortunately, due to financial circumstances, I have been unable to purchase a PlayStation 5, despite wanting one since release. Despite my financial circumstances; however, I have always spent a lot of money on birthday and valentine gifts for my girlfriend as I place high importance on gift giving and receiving as a love language.Last year for my birthday my girlfriend only took me out for dinner, and while I was disappointed, at the time she was unemployed so I was satisfied with my gift. This year, though, she has a full-time job so my expectations were higher, especially after she asked me outright what I wanted. I explained to her that, unsurprisingly, I wanted a PlayStation 5 and that it would make my year. She told me she’d see what she could do.My birthday was last week and when I got home I was eagerly anticipating my PlayStation 5 to be waiting for me. My girlfriend called me to our room and told me she had made us dinner reservations at my favorite restaurant. While I was slightly disappointed that this might be my only gift, I was still holding out hope that she’d surprise me with the PlayStation when we got back home.When we got home; however, instead she gave me a handmade photo album binder with all of her favorite pictures of me and her together that must’ve cost less than $40 to make. I was extremely and visibly disappointed and asked her what happened to the PlayStation? She asked me if that was seriously all I had to say and then asked me if I didn’t care at all about the effort she put in for my gift. I told her I didn’t care about photos that I could just look at on my phone, and that I didn’t understand why she couldn’t have just bought me the PS5. She called me an ungrateful asshole and left to a friends house. I have texted her multiple times since explaining that I’ve never had a problem spending upwards of $500 on a gift for her and that gifts are important to me but she hasn’t responded.Am I the asshole for being disappointed?Update: I woke up this morning to a “we’re through” text from my gold digger of an ex girlfriend. You guys have been nothing but extremely pressed towards me, but I now understand I should only be looking for relationships with people who can match the type of gifts and money I put in.

It wasn't that bad, other than the constant dead naming.But I could tolerate that. The real problem comes to my SiL. Some information about her. She was in a car accident when she was in middle school and is now in a wheelchair. My brother started to date her after asking her out to a dance in highschool, I'm believe he did it out of pity and went on dates with her because he's a nice person and didn't want to let her know he wasn't interested in her. They got married and he went to start a successful business. She started working in the business with him when he first started it, but I really wonder how much she really did because she now doesn't have anything to do with it. She just stays home all day and does nothing but watch TV, hang out with some of her girlfriends and just waste time not doing anything of value. My brother defends this unproductive behavior by using her surgery 2 years ago as an excuse for her not being able to leave the house. It was TWO YEARS AGO!!!!On to the incident. Right now I am staying with my parents after the whole COVID thing. And my brother and his wife visit and they are talking about how everyone is so negatively affected and how the job market is difficult for everyone. This is where I said I was grateful that I would always have a job in a successful business with my brother. This is where my SiL had the audacity to say that I didn't. He looks at her and she gives him these eyes and he says to me that I didn't have a relevant education to what the job required and that I needed to \"figure out something for myself for once\". This DOESN'T sound like my brother at all, growing up our parents taught us to always have each other's back. I am sure she poisoned him against me. I know she hates me because I am trans. Not only doesn't she respect my gender identity, she also thinks that I'm a psychotic narcissist. How do I know? I saw her activity on Facebook and Twitter agreeing with JK Rowling, parroting TERF rhetoric and posting pseudo scientific studies showing the prevalence of personality disorders among trans women....So this is where I might be the asshole. I was a little bit mad and I said something along the lines of this to my SiL \"You are just a gold digger who is living off of my brother's good graces. (I could have added crippled, but I would never stoop that low). Get a job or go live in the streets.\" I admit, this was a little bit mean, but she provoked me into it. After I said this no one in my family wants to talk to me, my parents are telling me that I have a week to move out.

I assume that I got a lot of his height genes, which is why I’m so much shorter than my mom. Anyways, even though my father abandoned my mom and I, my mom worked her ass off to keep me healthy and safe while also bringing home money to support the two of us, and I love her to the ends of the Earth. I know that in the past she probably used to turn down dates just to take care of me(I know she’s my mom, but I have eyes so I know that she is a good looking woman).I’ve been hearing a lot of comments recently from my friends asking why my own mom was so much taller than me, and I said that my biological father was really short, but I also got really conscious of my height in relation to hers. I asked my mom if she could stop wearing heels so she didn’t look so much taller than me, and she agreed. Anyways, for the last couple weeks she stopped wearing heels, except for yesterday. Yesterday, when my mom picked me up from a tennis meet with my friends, she wore these really tall heels, and I kind of lashed out. Once we got into the car, I started yelling at her for embarrassing me, and my mom said that she forgot about what I said, but then I told her I wished that I didn’t have to be seen with her in public, and I said a couple more things that I think hurt my mom badly. Looking back I was pretty cruel.Earlier this morning(like 5 AM so my mom probably thought I was still asleep), I saw my mom crying and she was looking at a picture of us when we went on a Caribbean cruise a couple years back.

His girlfriend and I have never seen eye to eye, and my son says it’s my fault, of course because I’m his evil mother I guess! If you ask her a question, she gives you the most logical, unsugar-coated response. She doesn’t really talk to my side of the family but does talk to my husbands and my daughter who adores her. She doesn’t like kids and when I asked her about kids she told me as much, and I find this girl to be completely disrespectful with how quiet she is, how she acts strangely around my family at events, and how unaffectionate she is with people.

My son says she’s not affectionate with her own family and that my family has made it impossible for her to be close to because we have always treated her disrespectfully, which I don’t see.

And as a whole we are almost 19 people in each barbecue.Now, it was my turn to host this month, and honestly, I wasn't exactly thrilled about it. You see, I'mnot the one who wears the apron in my house. That title goes to my wife, Alexandra (F30). She's a wizard in the kitchen, a cooking genius, and she takes care of most of the housework too. Me? I'm more like the clueless sidekick in the culinary department.But here's the kicker. In my family, it's always the ladies who take charge of the cooking and baking. It's not a hard and fast rule or anything, it just sort of happens that way. My brothers, my dad and I, usually keep our distance from the kitchen. I guess the women in my family have some kind of secret pact or maybe they're just better at it, who knows? But it has always being this way, even my dad doesn't allow us to help them.Anyway, back to the barbecue. Alexandra had been going all out to make this mind-blowing dish for the family reunion. Which being completely honest, i don't quite remember what it was. It was something with fish.  But here's where things took a turn for the worse. The day before the big event, I went to work as usual, but i had an immense amount of work so i didn't pay attention to my phone.When i came back home Alexandra comes up to me with a worried look on her face. She asks if I got this \"spice\" she needed for the dish. I asked what she was talking about. And she was visibly upset, and we started arguing. For my luck, she had being messaging me to get this thing, but as i just told you, i was busy. Of course if it was that urgent, she could've called me and being clearer, and how was I supposed to know.To give credit where it's due, Alexandra worked her magic and managed to salvage the dish. So that's why i wasn't worried, cause she always comes up with a plan B. It wasn't exactly what she had envisioned, but it still turned out pretty decently. All of my family loved it and complimented us.However while she was working i could see she was not looking good. So I asked her if i could be of any assistance. She turned to me and started laying into me about being an utterly useless partner for not being capable of getting just that spice.I talked this with my siblings, all of my brothers agree that she took it way too far for just a spice and it wasn't like i was ignoring her, i was busy, but my sisters on the other hand disagree and they think I was pretty much an AH.AITA??",

	"body" : "I (26F) have a degree in communications and work in an office as a decorator/event coordinator. I went to dinner with my friend (26F) who just finished her Masters’ degree in electrical engineering and got a job offer at popular high tech company. She received this job through connections, and she makes a lot of money (I don’t know the exact value but she’s able to invest and travel internationally). Her parents paid for all her schooling so she has no student loan debt. I don’t have debt either as I received free education. At dinner, I told her that I wanted to go on a trip and I invited her but she declined. I kept asking her why and she finally admitted that it was because I party too much and am irresponsible, that she doesn’t want to babysit me on a trip. She said she doesn’t want to risk her career because of a messy situation, which I took great offense to because her career is no better than mine. I like to have fun and I made a lot of friends in college by partying and going out. This disagreement turned messy and I told her that the reason why she has what she has is because she came from privilege. She got upset by this and then told me that she worked hard and studied all the time doing research and internships while I wasted my time in college partying and drinking. I am so upset because my friend has no grip on life, she has no real life skills because all she can do is useless math while her parents handed her everything in life. I had to work, and I still work for the money I have. She is adamant on not traveling with me, and I am upset because of this and what she said to me. So am AITA for calling her out for being ignorant and coming from privilege?",

Unfortunately, I'm somewhat of a disorganized mess and don't really care whether my living space is perfectly clean or arranged.She has started doing more of the household labor and chores in order to maintain her standards and resents me for not doing my share. I tried telling her that these are her standards and not mine and it shouldn't take away from my free time. Unfortunately, the situation blew up this morning with her calling me inconsiderate and selfish and me calling her controlling. We haven't spoken to each other since then.Honestly, I'm pretty angry about this and feel like I'm right to not want to do extra work for no reason. I also don't think I should be subjected to verbal abuse from her and her behaving this way is out of line.

I really don’t have a sweet tooth but my husband and kids do. I ordered a small scoop in a cup to share with my son, while my daughter got a kids sized cone and my husband got a regular sized cone with one scoop of ice cream.I should add here that my husband and I are planning a beach vacation to celebrate our 10 year anniversary in a couple months and he’s been trying to lose weight to get ready for it. He’s not obese by any means (6’0” and about 200lbs) but he wants to feel comfortable in a swimsuit while we’re on vacation.When I saw his ice cream I said that he should have just gotten a kids sized cone. He basically laughed it off and kept eating his ice cream. A few minutes later I added that not only did he get the regular size cone, he got one that was dipped in chocolate and he had just eaten deep fried fish and chips the night before. He got a little upset at this point and replied that he had done four intense workouts this week and had already lost 7lbs over the past 5 weeks and that it doesn’t matter if he eats a desert once a week. I told him that I just didn’t want him to undo all of his hard work since I know he wants to be ready for vacation.Later he told me that he didn’t think it was ok for me to fat shame him in front of our kids. I reminded him that I’ve told him many times it really annoys me when he eats deserts because they’re so unhealthy, but he does it anyways. Now he seems upset with me when I’m just trying to help him be healthy.So, AITA for telling my husband he shouldn’t have gotten an ice cream cone?",

Recently, one of the girls in the group invited everyone to an escape room for her birthday. My girlfriend told me that there would be a party at the host's place afterwards, and when we finished the escape room, the seven girls in the group were all going to leave to the party, leaving me and the two other guys behind. I suggested that we all go out to a bar or club together, but the girls refused.I made the suggestion in a way that didn't reveal that I knew they were going to party without us. I then confronted them directly and basically said that they were excluding and that I was upset on mine and the boys behalf. Everyone else had invited everyone to their birthdays, and it was not a money or space issue as we had all partied at her place multiple times before, everyone brought own drinks, and there wasn’t going to be food.The main reason I was upset was because we were a minority in the group, and the exclusion seemed to be based purely on gender nothing else. Up to the point where I confronted the host, I hoped that she just hadn’t thought it through and would invite us when I suggested we all should go out. But the way they all just looked at each other and smiled sheepishly and didn’t say anything made me angry.From then on I didn't want to go to the party because I was mad at the host, and I just wanted to make her reflect on what she had done. By confronting her, I really just wanted to make her feel bad and didn't really want to be invited.So, AITA for being upset about being excluded and then confronting the host just to make her feel bad?Edit: Broke text into paragraphs:)",

	"body" : "Me: 31M, I'm a broadcast journalist at a national UK publication, eg. News Reporter (not news reader)Wife: Jess, 30F, local activist, and works in a national charity, started a PhD this year.We've been together since uni, 12 years together in total. Many of our mates know us as a \"unit\" due to this.We both had a uni \"reunion\" last week, where we both attended as we graduated in the same year, although we did different courses. Jess is a very beautiful woman and has always been, I'm an average looking bloke and has always been. So obviously, we had gotten lots of jokes through our relationship about that, I'm not insecure about it as I don't care about my looks that much and it's not like they're calling me ugly anyway, they're just calling her hot.So we're at this reunion and someone brought up how impressive it was that Jess and I are still together, as we're the only couple in my friend group to \"last\". I then made some jokes that are the AITA in the question. I said us boring journos always need a \"side piece\" of a hot woman with leftist politics and the ass of a century. I said I'd never break up with my trophy wife, for example look at (other male journalists and their hot wives) because any time someone wants to criticise me for my journalism, I could put my arms up and say \"hey look, this is my wife, I can't be that much of a scumbag! and use that as a \"shield\".I was being self deprecatory, Jess was known in uni and is known in the local community for being a vocal activist. She works in a national charity and also does a lot of things to help refugees in her day to day life. I'm proud of her for it and it's not like my politics disagree: we both hold the same views. Jess has also started a PhD this month, on a scholarship, so I don't at all think of her as a \"bimbo\", I was simply referring to a common joke in our field that male journalists have sexy wives.Jess wasn't happy with my joke. She told me after the event that she felt undervalued and like her job and activism is a \"joke\" to me. This is not true at all, she makes just a bit more than me with her charity job and her scholarship, so I'd never see her job as a joke. However, she said she didnt appreciate the \"misogyny\" of the comments our friends made in response which I laughed at (had a few bevs). She especially did not like the joke about using me as a \"shield\" because random people have previously attacked her for being with me as her job is so visible.I thought it was just a regular joke in the field, and not something she should take offense at: considering she WORKS WITH REFUGEES she has had to deal with a lot worse comments from the public and should have had thicker skin for this pathetic joke. I told her so, and now she is totally giving me the silent treatment. AITA? Should I have apologised?",

	"body" : "Throwaway for privacy reasons. I (25f) have this friend, let’s call her Lily (27f) and she got in a car accident on her way to my house that left her in the hospital for over a month. During that time I visited her once for like 30 mins and told her how my husband and I got a new car so once she got out we would be able to come see her, as I knew she was really lonely and her depression was getting worse from being stuck in a hospital bed unable to move. While she was still in the hospital we talked on the phone every day and she kept saying how alone she felt and how she couldn’t wait to see me and my daughter(3f).Fast forward to when she got out, she called me and asked when I would be coming to see her cause it was “all she had to look forward to”. I told her it would be easier for me if she could just come to my house as driving for an hour was difficult with a toddler. She got annoyed and told me she couldn’t because she was “in a wheelchair she couldn’t get up the steps to my house and traveling was very painful for her still”. I thought that wasn’t a good enough excuse cause she traveled to get to her followup appointments and didn’t complain about that, but I told her maybe I would come to see her in a week or so. She seemed okay with that and left it alone for a week and then called to ask again when we would be coming to see her but again I told her it would be easier for her to come to us as I thought she would have gotten over herself by now. But she gave the same excuses and I told her maybe she should just rest up and I would see her when she was was able to travel in a car again. I thought that would make her see how silly she was being, and she would just come to us, but she just hung up and never came.I reached out a few more times and she kept telling me how left out she felt not being able to do anything with her friends, so I again offered for her to come visit and again she gave the same excuses. At that point I was really annoyed, and here’s where I may be TA I told her it was her own fault she felt left out cause she wasn’t making any effort to see anyone, she just kept using her wheelchair as an excuse. I get that she got injured breaking like half her body but they taught her how to get up the stairs before she left the hospital. She told me that I was being a shitty friend and she's glad I don't fully understand what she's going through and she hopes I never have to but that I could try to at least pretend to care that she's hurting. Which I found really hurtful of her to say. I have tried. I have invited her over and I always answer the phone when she calls even though I know she's just going to complain. But I'm not going to make my toddler sit in the car for an hour just because it's slightly inconvenient for her. I think she’s just being dramatic. She had no problem always coming over to my house before the accident, so I don’t get why she’s being so difficult about it now. But now she won’t talk to me, so AITA?",

I think it’s been over 2 months since I last went hunting, or really did any sort of leisure activity for that matter. I mean throw me a bone here, jeez. If she had a real excuse I would understand, but I’m just wanting a favor in return. I’m even offering to pay her, so it’s not a pure favor. I told my sister that she was being selfish, and mentioned how I helped her all the time, all she said is sorry but I can’t watch her.What the hell. Who else am I going to find to watch my daughter that I can trust? Pardon my language, but my sister is being a massive bitch. AITA for thinking it’s reasonable she should watch her?Edit: I’m a guy, FYIEdit 2: the dye has been cast at this point, but if you do enough favors and help someone enough times, it just seems to me it’s not unreasonable to expect that you might get some help in return. There’s no tangible or concrete excuse as to why, she just doesn’t want to deal with the extra hassle.

I told tomie to cut it out and to have some empathy for her sister and she argued back, questioning me on \"why shouldn't she be able to style her hair just because her sister can't?\" I got furious and told her to stop being selfish and just because Ella doesn't say anything doesn't mean it doesn't hurt. Tomie refused to listen and said that she couldn't just go to the party with her hair half-styled and looking like rubbish so I told her that if her hair matters so much then she can forget about her stupid party.My husband found out about this and claimed I was \"making an issue\" out of nothing and just making Tomie resent her sister. I thought that was dumb because why on earth should Tomie resent her sister when she's suffering so much, and if she does that's disgusting and cruel in my opinion.

My gf didn't want to take care of Deliah, which is whatever and I cannot change that. So I'm basically a single dad. I love Deliah, she is my life. She means everything to me, and I'd give a life and take a life for my baby. That's how much I love her. She's my world.When i informed my mom & dad that i had a daughter and i introduced my baby girl to my parents. , my dad's first move was to run upstairs and barge in my room grab all my stuff and go to the door and throw it out on the ground, he then pointed outside and yelled, and snapped his finger \"GET OUT RIGHT NOW!\" my mom was crying telling my dad \"no let him stay let him stay, we finally have some good news, etc\" and my mom was happy about my daughter as the last few years in our family, was not good. So announcing a new family member on the way brought a smile to my mom.My dad put all my belongings outside, while I held Deliah on my shoulder. I grabbed my stuff and left. I then walked to my local motel holding Deliah and we stayed there for a few days, till i figured out what i need to do and everything. It was rough. I didn't have enough money, and I had a daughter but I knew that i have to give my baby girl a good life regardless. I called my best friend \"Deandre\" who then gave my number to \"John\" and a lady named \"Janice\" who runs a daycare at her house which was super cheap so i could drop deliah off before workJohn owns a small warehouse. He offered me a job for $14/hr and he hooked me up with one of his connections to offer me a small studio apartment for cheap. So the baby was taken care of at daycare, and i got a job. I worked daily, and using the money i had after taking care of Deliah, the bills, etc. I started saving it up and whatever i saved i started a business. I started an e-commerce arbitrage-based business which took a lot of work and months. A lot of time, and money was lost but i eventually succeeded and my life changed completely. Moved into a new apartment, bought a car, got the best for my baby, and changed my lifestyle. Now i'm living good, i get to work from home. Take care of my daughter and life is amazing.I recently invited mom to my new home to see her granddaughter, and she was excited and came over instantly i open the door and it's my dad with mom.

It did, therapy is a wonderful thing, but he hasn't let go of the issue.On his 21st anniversary he made a speech and asked the family and closest friends to start calling him \"John John\" and suddenly the room descended into chaos. People were cheering and talking about how it was a huge step for him. Our father was really proud. But I thought it was a weird request.

My parents helped us with buying this house as a wedding gift and we are so grateful as we understand how lucky we are. Because of this, we made sure to furnish one of the bedrooms as a guest room so we can host others often.When I was a freshman in college, I dated Mark. We dated for about a year and it ended amicably. We remained friends after and he even introduced me to James. James and I started dating about 3 months after Mark and I broke up and he knew that Mark and I were friends that once dated. Over the years, Mark and I have always been friendly but we have gone through periods of times where we are closer as friends. James has made some comments saying how it’s “weird” that Mark and I are friends, but I told him that Mark and I are nothing more and I don’t see why it’s “weird”.A couple days ago, Mark asked me if he would be able to stay with me while he was in between leases. He said it would only be about 2 weeks. I told him of course and that I would get the guest room ready for him. I told James later that day and he got really upset and told me I should have consulted him first. I asked why as we have both had some friends stay with us and we didn’t consult each other then. James said it is because Mark is my ex and that it’s weird that he would be sleeping under our roof with him knowing our history. I said that he is being a bit dramatic and that although Mark and I have a “history”, he is just a friend.I ended up going to Mark’s apartment because I was so upset and needed to vent without getting any of our other friends involved. Mark just listened to me as I ranted about how crazy James was acting. I talked to my mom earlier about this as well and she said that she does think Mark and I have a “rather odd” relationship and that she sees where James is coming from. It’s been a few days and James and I are barely speaking and it’s clear he is still very upset.I truly don’t understand what the big deal is but I need to know, AITA?EDIT: I’m seeing a lot of comments saying that I am cheating with Mark, emotionally and/or physically.

I woke up a bit late like at 12 P.M. I got a notification on my phone about my RING camera. I checked it and a pacakged had been delivered. I hadn’t ordered anything in a while so I wasn’t sure what it was. I went downstairs and I got the package and it was a box with the word WEVERSE scattered all over it. When I checked the address it seemed to be right. I, of course, have no idea what a WEVERSE is so I opened it up. I found 3 KPop albums inside. It had a cover of what I guess to be a sun, flames and the word “HEAT”. I opened up the album because it looked cool. It has a bunch of little cardboard posters? I don’t know what to call them. It had a CD, a photo, and now that I searched it up I know they’re called photocards.Fast-forward to yesterday. My friend came over, I hadn’t told her about my little surprise package. First thing she asked me was “Have you gotten any packages?” What a strange question. I answered no. I wanted to see where this would go. She got all nervous and she honestly looked like she was about to start crying. She told me that she had ordered some stuff and had it all sent to MY house. I blew up. What right did SHE have sending stuff to MY house. I was yelling at her about it. She of course said “So you got the mail?! Why didn’t you tell me?!” Was it MY responsibility to take care of HER package that she hadn’t been keeping track off. I wouldn’t have mind if she told me about it beforehand. I know that where she lives it’s very busy and there are many thieves around. But to just not tell me about this. For all I know there could’ve been a bomb in there.She told me I was bein illogical and that I was the thief for taking her package. She then proceeded to SEARCH my WHOLE house just to find the KPop albums. Once she found them she yelled at me some more and then stormed out and left. I mean, I see why she’s mad. In her eyes I basically just stole something that belonged to her. I just don’t think she had to wait to tell me. After, she texted me saying that she was gonna contact a lawyer and sue me for “stealing” a package that was on my doorstep. She said that if I just dropped it then it wouldn’t be as bad. She also told me that if I just told her that I got her package. Problem is, it didn’t have her name on it. She’s stopped messaging me at all. I don’t think I’m overreacting, in fact I think she is.

I embraced this role as I cannot have children so I see M as my daughter.In the past year, M has become obsessed with the singer Harry Styles, by obsessed I mean she will neglect family responsibilities just to talk to her friends about Harry Styles, no offense to the guy but I don't know how they can talk about him so much.When she first got into his music we decided it would be a good idea to go see him as he was touring near where we lived and we managed to find tickets from resellers as we were too late to get them ourselves (quite expensive by the way). M was lucky enough to get him to sign her poster and it has become her prized possession.For the past couple months, M has been neglecting her responsibilities (chores, helping with dinner etc.) Because she is either listening to, or talking about Harry Styles. Me and my husband put up with this because we thought it would blow over but it has only got worse.This takes us to yesterday, me and my husband made dinner after work and called M down, no response. We go up to her room to find that she is gone, her window wide open. It turned out, after many phone calls, that she disappeared to town with her friends to go buy Harry Styles albums/merchandise.

I decided that it was time she outgrew her Harry Styles obsession, so i waited for her to come home and ripped up her signed poster in front of her eyes.She looked at me for a second before screaming, you would've thought we had died or something with how anguish filled her screams were. She looked at me with tears and shouted \"I HATE YOU, YOUR NOT MY MUM, MY MUM WOULD NEVER DO THIS!\" Before slamming the door in my face and locking it.My husband said that I went too far but I don't see why she is so upset, she can just get another poster. I even went into her room and offered to get her another signed poster (which are very expensive) but she just ignored me.I feel very guilty, however this has been a long time coming in my opinion as she has been testing my patience for months now.AITA?",

I understand her circumstances are difficult, but ever since she began living with us she has been entitled, attention-seeking, and generally incapable of taking responsibility for her actions. I suspect this is less to do with the circumstances and more to do with how she was raised: my brother- and sister-in-law were “lax” parents, and she responds to even the slightest discipline by screaming and crying on the ground like a toddler. As she has been put in my care, I consider it my responsibility to put my foot down regarding these behaviors.This morning, she said that she was sick when I called her down for breakfast. She did not have a fever or any other signs of illness. I told her to go downstairs and eat because we had things to do today.When she finally came down, she refused to eat breakfast, saying she felt too sick. It has already occurred multiple times that she has not eaten at the table and then expected to be made or bought food when she was hungry later. I was absolutely not going to buy her fast food while we were out today, so I told her to sit down and eat the food I had prepared.She acted very dramatic while she ate, groaning and clutching her stomach like a cartoon character. When this didn’t get her sympathy, she threw up on the floor. She says she couldn’t help it, but I don’t believe that. If she was really sick, she could’ve gone to the bathroom. The fact that she threw up right on the carpet makes me think she was trying to make a scene.But regardless of her motivations, she made a mess, and in my house, people take responsibility for themselves. I told her she would be expected to clean the carpet, and to pay for a professional service if she was unable to do it adequately herself (she gets an allowance, so she has money). Her reaction? To start sobbing and screaming at me, and then to run up to her bedroom and slam the door. All because I asked her to clean the mess she made. She hasn’t left her room since.I think all of this reflects on the way her parents have been raising her. She seems to believe that putting on enough of a show will get her whatever she wants, and that crying will relieve her of basic responsibilities. I understand I’m not her parent, but I am her legal guardian for the moment. Spoiled, attention-seeking children grow into spoiled, attention-seeking adults, and I just can’t imagine letting this go and letting her think that this kind of behavior is acceptable.",

I am, and will never be a thief or a liar.

There was no two ways about it, it was love at first sight. This pup was full of energy and love, and it struck a cord inside me. I don't know what breed she is, but she looks to be a golden girl. So I named her Florida since that's where I discovered her LOL! I thought it was very fitting and I was proud to have her join my family. Fast forward a couple of months and that joy turned into pain and hardships. I was showing off florida to multiple forums and dog loving sites, and apparently these folks don't understand what a rescue is, and accused me of stealing the dog. I don't understand how people can be so inconsiderate and emotional. These people don't seem to understand what a stray dog is, and they have begun attacking me and claiming I shouldn't have picked up Florida, and I shouldn't have done this or that. Let me get one thing straight, If you see a dog out on the streets, you're are seriously going to tell me, the thing to do is to ignore it? Hogwash, pure and utter hogwash. I wasn't raised to abandon those in need, and shame on those who suggest I should just leave a poor defenseless dog in the streets. People don't just let their dogs roaming about where anything can happen, yet I'm apparently the one in wrong? Do these people just think owned dogs roam around? I never let my dogs out of my sight let alone run around town without me. These people have even begun messaging my wife demanding she return Florida! So many people are telling me to return this poor dog to the streets and saying how wrong I was for giving her a home. So here I am, asking you bunch if I should return her or keep her in my home. I don't think it's a good idea to just abandon a dog, but my wife is constantly on me about this now, and she's about had it with this stuff.

Girls have to go through so much more, especially physically so boys yielding comfort to them is basic decency.Anyway I found out about this when the head camp counsellor (F21) offered me a partial credit for future activities run by the organization and praised my daughter for \"taking the initiative\" and volunteering to sleep on the floor. I asked if anyone else volunteered they replied in the negative. I then asked if they asked a boy to take her spot. The counsellor give me a weired look and said so they did not, my daughter volunteerd so there was no need to ask anyone. I told her that girls should not be asked to sacrifice comfort for boys and that a boy should have been asked to volunteer this. She got annoyed at me, and told me that I was \"stuck in the past\". I told her exasperatedly that \"basic respect and courtsey does not change; it is a matter of equity\" but she just ignored me.ETA; Non-profit org ran the camp; overbook was an honest mistake, know enough about org to attest that",

	"body" : "My 34 year old brother Michael died two weeks ago apparently from cardiac arrest from taking too many pain pills for too many years. He died in his apartment and it was a week before anyone noticed he was missing. Sad, but true.Anyways, my mother is acting like the grieving mother and it rubbed me the wrong way. I told her I didn't understand why she was all sad when she hadn't communicated with him in three months? My brother wasn't some street junkie. He actually had a corporate job and did crossfit. My mom and him stopped getting along once he stopped giving her money to enable our other siblings who are the real bad apples.I just don't understand how a mother can go through months without knowing if their child is dead or alive because they don't reach out to them but then act all sad when they die. For the record, my mother does reach out at least least once a week to the other kids and panics if she can't reach them. She's not neglectful to all of us.Some people might say there were dynamics in play but I've been there and know that's it's way more simple than that. My mom just didn't care. For example, my brother sent her flowers for her birthday every year and she'd quickly call him for his - like three days after his birthday.I've been called heartless and an asshole. I don't think I am. He's being cremated and she wants to keep his ashes. For what? So you can stuff him in a cupboard with the Liquid Plumber?",

	"body" : "For context, I (37F) own a local dispensary. I also have four kids 17M, 16F, 14F, and 12M. My husband and I are both stoners and we allow or oldest two to smoke (within moderation). We don't outright buy it for them, but they know where we keep it and we don't try to stop them from taking it.This brings me to the problem at hand. My daughter (16F) had a friend over this past Friday, let's call her \"Anne\" (16F). Anne comes from a relatively conservative, Christian family. Anne's mother knew what I do for work prior to letting her come over. She's aware that my husband and I smoke but doesn't know that I allow my OWN children to smoke.Anne and my daughter came straight home after school and I got home from work around 5:30. When I walked past the hall where the bedrooms are located, I could definitely smell someone smoking, but I assumed it was my husband or my son.I chose not to investigate my daughter and her friend because I generally trust my kids and don't like to barge in on them when they have company. I also didn't really expect this from them as Anne has always been the innocent type. Plus, they seemed to be acting normal when they came into the kitchen.Well apparently Anne's mother smelled it on her daughter's clothes and drug tested her the next day. I asked my daughter and she confessed to me that the two of the smoked a preroll together in my daughters room. Understandably upset, Anne's mother called me to chew me out for supplying her daughter with drugs. I informed her that I did not give it to them and that they must have found my stuff on their own.She proceeded to insult me for being \"oblivious\" to the fact someone was smoking in my house. I told her that I smelled it but had assumed it was my husband. This made her even angrier and she began accusing me of being \"willfully ignorant\". I apologized profusely but she was still angry when she hung up.Over the past week, Anne's mother and her friends have making rude posts on facebook about what a bad mother I am. My own daughter is in hot water with me because she knows how I feel about breaking another parent's trust, but at the same time, if Anne is going to try it, I'd obviously prefer it be in a safe environment with stuff I know hasn't been tampered with. AITA?(TLDR: I smelled weed when my daughter had guest over at our house and now her mother is angry at me for not going to check on them)Edit: So it appears everyone is saying i'm and asshole. That's fair, I definitely should have secured my stash when I heard she'd be coming over. For those of you saying I should be thrown in jail have my kids taken from me, i'd like to clarify a few things. Contrary to some of your comments, my kids do not have \"unlimited access\". Majority of my stash stays in my closet, and the little bit we do leave out for them we actually monitor to know how much they are taking. Plus we never leave out more than a gram at a time and do not supply them with pens/carts. My kids are not stoners. They have easy access to it and do not feel the need to jump on any chance they have to get high. I have since talked to Anne's mother who will not be taking legal action. We can both agree on the fact that my weed needs to be more safely stored away when underage guests are over. Beyond that, Anne's mother is holding Anne accountable for wanting to try in the first place. Their rules are none of my business, through, Anne will no longer be allowed over to our house and my daughter will be searched before going over to her house.Edit 2: Stop assuming everyone is American.

I explained that as my wife she has responsibilities beyond simply finishing her chores ahead of time and that I can’t keep going to social events either alone or with a disengaged wife. I even payed for babysitters so I told her she needed to grow up and read like normal people do in blocks of time, but she got really offended and said that I don’t have a right to tell her what to do with her weekends, which I think is ridiculous because I’m her husband and I shouldn’t have to beg for some kind of attention from my own wife.",

When I met Tom I was a single mother and honestly times were rough. My previous husband disappeared just after the divorce and although he paid me some alimony I was on my own with raising our kids. Liliana was very difficult as a teenager. She had anger outbursts, refused to talk to me, told me she hated me. She didn’t like Tom either and got so upset with us once we announced pregnancy. She said it’s never going to be her sibling. When Bella was born hard times arrived. Tom and I argued so he moved out and I still had to attend my work (I work night shifts sometimes). Liliana started taking care of Bella when I was at work or when I was sleeping after a night shift.  Since then she, Bella and Kaia have been like best friends.It all changed when she got herself into medical university, she spent the whole day outside of our home. It got difficult on us, since Liliana stopped doing her part in house activities. When I ask her to cook or  help with her siblings she always responds “I have a test this week” and it’s the end of discussion.But apparently she got herself a job as a tutor. When Tom and I found out both of us got a little bit angry. As if we were lied to. Times are really rough and to support such a big family we need to work a lot so we need someone at the house to look after the young. Liliana knows it well enough but she chose to be selfish and help herself and not the family. I only told her I’m disappointed with her actions. Tom started yelling at her, saying she is so selfish and  the family would be better off if she didn’t work and just babysat her sisters. Liliana started yelling back at him, saying she would be better off working and that WE are the selfish ones. She started crying about never having money to buy herself anything, that her dad sends me money for herself and not for the whole family and she hates being the mother of the house. Tom kept on yelling at her and I just left the room because I didn’t want her to see me crying. But apparently Tom crossed some line because he yelled “if you are so miserable with us you are free to move out”. So she did.  I don’t know when and how but she got back in contact with her father.

I don’t know where he lives so I don’t have a way to go over to his place to talk some sense into her.I feel betrayed by her as she knows how much dependent we are on her. My ex husband also stopped paying me alimony for my daughter which is against the law. Tom and I thought about suing him for it. Maybe this way, if we cut her off money wise , Liliana would realize she is reliant on us too. WIBTA?Edit: by alimony I meant child support. I got languages mixed up.Edit2: since when chores are child abuse? It’s not like Liliana is the only one taking care of the children. She simply has to help out in moments of need like pick them up once a week or take them for a walk while I clean the house. As a family we have to work as a unit and not individuals who don’t care about each others.Edit3: since so many ask about it. We met to talk and as some of you suggested I said I’m fine with her living with her dad and he doesn’t have to pay me anything but I also won’t pay for her last three years of University as it’s 4 times what he was paying me as child support.

For my birthday this year, she organized a dinner with my family for which she cooked a dish from her home country and made a home-made cake, plus she handled the shopping all on her own - all of this took two+ days of preparation. She also organized a surprise weekend trip to a city I've been wanting to visit.For her birthday, I wanted to organize a trip to a city famous for the Christmas markets, which she loves, but it ended up being too expensive. So I decided to make it up by preparing a homemade advent calendar for her, I bought some little presents for each day and prepared some riddles for them to find them around the house. She was very happy and grateful.The fight happened on her birthday (4th December). Her parents were visiting so she asked me a week before if I wanted to go to the restaurant or if I wanted to have dinner at home, and I obviously said I'd cook for them since she did the same for me. I was supposed to go to the office so she planned to spend the day with her parents. I ended up having to stay home so I could go buy some ingredients that were missing. She texted me all morning but I only managed to answer at 3.30pm since I was busy with work, and told her I decided to work from home in the end. She stayed with her parents and 5.30pm asked me if it was OK if she came over with her parents a bit earlier or if I preferred for them to come directly at dinner (8pm).That's when I got annoyed: she had no intention of helping me cleaning up the house, she left dirty dishes in the sink (it was her turn to do the dishes) so she was forcing me to do them for her (because of course I wasn't going to make her wash dishes on her birthday in front of her parents) and she had zero plan for the day, just fluttering around with her parents and not thinking about anything. She knew I was stressed out and wanted to make things perfect and she just added stress on top by telling me she would come earlier with her parents.I told her this by text so she left her parents at their hotel and came back home but she ended up making a scene and crying. From her POV, she didn't make me touch any dirty dishes on my birthday so I'm supposed to do the same for her (everything HAS to be exactly equal with her) and I got angry and made her cry on her birthday. Her parents had been to our place two nights before so they knew what to expect and there was nothing to clean anyway. From my POV, I was trying to plan a perfect night for her and she just up and left and left me to deal with everything. I did wash the dishes in the end and I was planning to from the beginning but I'm annoyed that I was forced to do so. I also prepared the advent calendar for her and brought her coffee in bed in the morning so she is just acting ungrateful.AITA for expressing my annoyance on her birthday?",

	"title" : "AITA for not giving my daughter a gift from her lesbian girlfriend?",
	"body" : "I (47M) am an airline pilot and a retired USAF lt col, and I have a 15-year-old daughter named Noa. Noa is in love with her classmate, Laura (15F). And of course I’ve got no problems with the LGBTQ+ community and I wish we could all just get along, but at their young age, I just don’t feel like their “love” is legitimate. They’re children, and they’re just figuring things out. I think their “love” is more of a passing thing, like a phase.Anyway, back in March this year, I was giving Laura a ride somewhere (her father trusts me very much with her safety, which I appreciate), and before she got out of the car, she reached into her bag and she pulled out a very beautiful bookmark. She told me that it was for Noa. I thanked her for it, and I let her know that I’ll give it to Noa when I get home….but when I went home, I didn’t really know what to do with it. I just set it aside, and eventually I forgot about it.A few weeks later, my wife (46F) found the bookmark, and she thought it looked wonderful. She asked me where it came from, and I told her that it was a “gift” to Noa from her girlfriend, except I wasn’t really sure if it was something worth passing along to our daughter. My wife got kind of confused, and she asked me why I didn’t give it to our daughter immediately. So I just told her about my true feelings about Noa’s relationship, and I let her know that I don’t really think of it as anything genuine. When I said this, my wife was horrified, and she just silently walked away. Later on, she gave Noa the bookmark…but she also told her that I have been withholding the gift from her. Noa was heartbroken, and she cried about this whole experience.I didn’t intend to make my daughter cry. Am I the bad guy here?EDITED just so everyone can see here: a commenter asked: \"When you say their love is a passing phase and they’re figuring stuff out do you mean you think your daughter might be too young to know she’s a lesbian?\"Yes, I do believe my daughter is too young to know that she's a lesbian. If she were 20+ or something like that, then I would have no doubts about her sexuality. But right now, she's just a little kid.Second edit to clear things up: Some of you may be wondering why I didn't just give the bookmark to Noa and why her sexuality is relevant at all. And I need to say that Laura's a very polite, intelligent, bright girl, but at that time, I considered her to be sort of a \"bad influence\" on my daughter. And I didn't know if I wanted to pass along a gift that came from a bad influence. It's now been months since the bookmark incident, and I'm still learning to deal with my prejudices, and I want to be more open. But I'm just asking for a little patience.",

I understand that sometimes it can be hard so i try to give him compliments to raise his confidence.His drawing aren't bad, and yesterday he was drawing something and i tell him his drawing was good in hope of him being more confident. HE CRIED. I didnt even know why he cried, he just destroyed his drawing muttering he didnt deserve compliments.It was clearly too much, he didnt have any reason to cry. I told him to stop being a crybaby because he will never be an adult if he keeps crying like that. I know it could sound harsh, but thats the truth and i hope it made him realize his attitude.

But i think it was the best thing to do becaude he cant continue to be like that. Im feeling guilty right now because this morning i bring him to school and he cried without reasons in the car.

Our parents have been helping with cleaning their house, organizing rides to treatment, going over to cook for them, etc. I wasn’t really sure what I could do that they aren’t already but I told them if I could fill in somehow then to let me know.My sister reached out in our family chat today and mentioned they needed some groceries. Our parents are out of town so I said I could pick them up for her. She sent me a list and I said I’d drop it off this evening. It was a list of about 20-items. I didn’t pay attention to how many things were on her list until I got to the store. I was also doing my grocery shopping at the same time. Both lists wound up being WAY more than I planned on spending. I did not get about 10 items from my sister’s list that didn’t seem like essentials.When I got to her house she asked if the store was out of things. I told her the truth and she seemed miffed. After we got the groceries put away she said she didn’t understand my point because she had sent me money via an app to cover the groceries. I did not know this until she said something about it.She asked if I could go back since I had the money and started guilt tripping me about their situation. I still needed to get home to put my own groceries away, so I told her I could just send her half of her money back and she can get it delivered or something.A while later she texted me and said “they” were hurt (I don’t think this is true because her husband didn’t say anything while I was there) and she said she wouldn’t be asking me for help anymore.

	"body" : "Me (35F) my boyfriend Kyle (36M) have been dating for about 5 months. His younger brother Connor (30M) has a girlfriend Serena (25F). The dynamic with her and my boyfriends family is confusing to say the least.Serena worked with Connor and they became good friends and connor introduced her to his family and she met Kyle. They dated for a few months and broke up. I don’t have info because I didn’t really care to understand the situation.I guess everything ended amicably because there is no bad blood between Kyle and Connor, and the family still loves her. I personally think she’s absolutely unbearable and annoying in every way possible.Last night we were all hanging out at Kyle’s family home, with his family. I don’t remember what led to the conversation but Serena was asking Kyle if he could beat Connor at arm wrestling, Kyle of course said he could.Then Serena loudly yelled across the room to Connor, “Kyle says he’s stronger then you and can beat you at arm wrestling”, everyone found this funny and made Kyle and Connor arm wrestle. Kyle won, and Serena announced that it was her turn to arm wrestle Kyle. She did and Kyle let her win. She got up and announced that since she beat Kyle she was obviously stronger then Connor since Kyle beat Connor.Everyone thought this was funny, laughed and moved on. She was later talking to Kyle and I interjected myself because I was not okay with her talking to him. She was talking about how happy she was that he let her win because Connor never lets her win at arm wrestling so now she has finally beat him. Kyle laughed and said he was happy to oblige. Then she went on to happily sit on Connors lap and joke with everyone the rest of the night.This honestly pissed me off, the fact she’s just so annoying but everyone just plays into it. So I thought it would be funny to call her out, indirectly of course since she hates confrontation.As everyone was playing a drinking game the conversation of how many kids everyone wanted came up. Connor and Serena were being super gross and talking about how they want a big family and Connor stated how good Serena is with kids and how nice it would be to see her with their own kids some day. Everyone chimed in about how great Serena is with kids and how cute their family would be. So I chimed in and said “of course Serena is great with kids since she acts like a child herself, I think it’s going to be a while till you two have kids since she has to grow up first.”No one laughed and Connor asked me to clarify what I meant, and Kyle told me what I said was unwarranted. Me and Kyle left after that and he told me that I was an asshole for saying what I did. But I think Kyle’s being the asshole for taking his ex girlfriend’s side. So Am I the asshole?TDLR; My boyfriends brother’s girlfriend was being immature so I called her out for it, AITA?Edit: everyone keeps saying I’m jealous. To clarify I thought calling her out would embarrass her, but for her own good. She needs to be more self conscious so she doesn’t act the way she does. In the end I would be saving her a lot of grief from being judged in everyday life. Since everyone isn’t as accepting as Kyle’s family.",

I don't know & we can't really tell.It wipes its ass on our jute rug. The rug is a large woven rough twine-like weave.

	"body" : "Hey all. This is my first time posting because I’m truly wondering if it’s just me. I’m not going to get into excruciating detail so there is no bias. Just a short summary, and from a birds eye view tell me if I’m wrong….For roughly 11 years(I’m 37/M) I’ve dedicated every waking minute to building a life for my family that’s free of stress and worry. I always put the burden on myself. The moto I live by is “if anyone in the family is going to suffer or go without it will be me”I’ve sacrificed every joy/indulgence In my life to get us to the beautiful point we sit today…..but I’ve NEVER limited them in what they want to do. If what they want requires more money I work extra hours to pay for it. NO ONE IN MY HOUSE GOES WITHOUT.I own four houses. All rental properties. 3 are paid in full. Nothing has come easy. I do all the home renovations myself and handle all the tennant calls on top of my full time job. But I’ve pushed through it all to get here.I work 45-50 hours a week at my full time job. Not counting hours spent with the investment properties. I have a good job and also provide the health insurance. My wife doesn’t work and my 2 children are home schooled. Any free time I do have I try to spend as much time with my kids as I can because I grew up in a house where my father never bothered with me. I know what that feels like.My wife has only briefly held a full time job (9months) in 15 years. And that doesn’t bother me. I’ve built  a life where her income is not ever needed unless she WANTS to work. I love that she is home and always available to my children. I don’t ask for anything in the relationship other than my house is clean (within reason with two young children) and that she “gets ready for me” a couple days a week. She is absolutely beautiful.I’ve finally gotten to the point now where I want options if I’m wrong. When I ask her to “get ready for me”. Which really means do her make-up and sometimes where a cute shirt/dress I like when I have a bad day at work, I’m met with the answer of “love me for who I am”. I’m starting to feel taken advantage of. I’ve WILLING and LOVINGLY, given everything I have to this family. My wife and kids literally don’t even know what it’s like to wake up to an alarm clock. Meanwhile I wake up most days at 5. Am I wrong to ask her for what is ,in my eyes ,the simplest of tasks?  To do her make up or simply wear a shirt I love once or twice a week for all the sacrifices I make every day? I don’t do it because I’m “superficial”. But because she is truly the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. And it truly brings me joy to come Home and see her…but again. I don’t feel like it’s a big ask…I’m happy to answer any follow ups and before u ask… yes. I’m very happy with my wife and children and they are my entire world. Of all the things I’ve accumulated in my life nothing means more to me than them.Thanks in advance everyone!",

My parents helped her move out and get a new place and since then she met her partner K (35m) and they been together for about 3 years.V has had infertility issues and a couple of miscarriages which has meant our parents have always supported her when I think its very sad but she also needs to move on as sadly thats part of life.

	"body" : "My daughter (20F) graduated high school in 2021, I recommended to her to take a year off until the vaccine mandate would get taken down. She also needed to save up money for a car, which she has now and bought it herself for $10K. I haven’t had a job until this year, so she has also been responsible for the rent, which is $680 right now. And I believe her car insurance is $375 and her phone bill is $40.She’s been working at a restaurant since a month before her graduation, and she still works there today. She recently got promoted so she got another raise, she works 30-35 hours a week. I don’t get much money anymore because I can’t claim her as a dependent, I made almost $5,000 when she was a dependent, but because of her age and she isn’t a student I no longer get anything. On top of that, I only work 2 hours a week at a job I hate as it is. We agreed that this would be the year she’d be attending college, it suits both of us financially, she needs to start working on her future. She was on board with it, she expressed a few times about wanting to take some online classes at the community college, but little did I know she wanted to do FULL online classes, which I am not okay with. She was already sheltered for 2 years with the 2 years of high school being robbed from her, I don’t think she understands or has any idea what her best interest is. She also just recently lost her state health insurance because she makes too much at her job, which was $23K a year last year. And now ever since she got promoted she got more hours, if she goes to school however, then she can limit her availability so she will make less, she needs to make less than $17K to get the free insurance back. But she wants to make things harder for herself and work for nothing, work full time and do online college at her community college so it won’t affect her job. I told her she is making things needlessly complicated, she argued that I was cool with it and referenced me saying so, I don’t remember ever saying that. And now, if she makes too much she probably won’t get good financial aid either. I tell her to listen to me and stop doing things the hard way. Now she wants to drop school altogether. She cannot work the same hours she is working and go to school, I don’t care if she has to lie to her manager, just change her availability to get her income down and attend school, it is that simple. She argues that her coworkers and even managers attend school online and work the same hours she does, and “why can’t I”. She has shut me out and always does the opposite of what I say because she has some dedication to this job, she doesn’t need to work so much and make a lot of money. I want her to meet people and have the college experience in school, online community college classes won’t give her that. Sure, she meets people at work but I mean in a different environment. I want her to do in-person classes.",

	"body" : "Throwaway kinda. I'm (33f)  having my first baby at the end of the year, and I live in a very high cost of living area where daycare for infants will total between $27,000-$35,000 per year. Additionally, waiting lists for infant rooms are up to a year long, so we are starting our search for an affordable daycare now. I can't leave the city for my line of work, and to be honest nothing in the surrounding area is much cheaper. If anything happened to our jobs we would need to move back to search for something in our industry.In addition to looking for a suitable daycare, we are trying to think out side the box for ways to save. Including: parents coming to take care of the baby for a month or so to kind of kick the can down the road of when daycare needs to begin, and moving into a studio or efficiency one bedroom to offset the costs by around 1k/month.My parents are from poverty and working class backgrounds (mom (51f) has 9th grade education and is a cashier at a fast food place, dad (52m) works in distribution factory.) And my mom said she could take off around 4 weeks to help after maternity leave. This is great, it means baby will be a bit older when he has to go to daycare and we will save a little and spend time with family.My partners (30f) parents won't commit to anything. They are both doctors who by choice work 6 months a year. They are divorced, and one of them (MIL 65f) lives alone in a 3 story house with a baby grand piano that she has never learned how to play (just trying to paint a picture here); MIL also paid for her niece to go to college. The other (FIL 65m) lives with and provides for his niece (different niece) and her 3 adult sons.Neither of them will commit to any time or financial assistance after the baby is born. They say they will \"do what they can when they can\" and won't reassure us of any level of support. I told them how we would love them to stay with us for a couple months and they won't do that, even saying they won't do it if they are not working.Of course, I've also mentioned the possibility of helping financially. I didn't specify a number, just asked them if they would consider it. When you have a new baby and no help, everything makes a difference; but I want to be able to predict things like \"should I use this money for groceries, or should I put it towards daycare? Am I able to catch a break and use this for a takeout dinner or a babysitter?\"AITA for expecting a solid answer on what we can expect? AITA for expecting more involvement and interest in helping my family get off to a good start? This is our first baby and everyone's first grandchild. Why can't I get a clear answer and why isn't there more interest in helping?Edit: thanks for the judgement that I am the asshole. I've read every comment. First, I am married to a woman and our parents were all very involved with the process of bringing this child to this point. All of them, enthusiastically. I have tried to be responsible by planning, and to me asking them is part of that planning and preparation. My wife is indeed shocked that they are not willing to help and that they have gone cold. Since I am the asshole and have no right to their time or money, I will no longer consider them in our future plans or facilitate anything with them at all. They don't get to play a role in my life without having empathy and perspective or without consequence. Thanks all.",

	"body" : "My older brother (23m) and I (19m) used to be very close. We both played football all throughout high school and even played one year together when he was a Senior and I was a freshman. We both got recruited to a local university to play at a d1 level and it’s always been our dream to play at a higher level.Everything was going to plan until my older brother (whom we’ll call “Jake”) got injured during off-season drills. He completely tore his Achilles and received a minor MCL injury. He was already playing at the collegiate level, but he never really recovered from the injury and eventually dropped out.Since then, I’ve enrolled in the same university and his life has sorta fallen apart. He’s gained significant weight and his girlfriend of 6 years recently dumped him for being overly lazy.One night, about 2 months ago, Jake and I were hanging out and playing COD at his place. We got to talking and eventually he started confiding in me about his recent mental health struggles and how he’d been coping with the breakup.For context, I’m not very good at biting my tongue and I tend to be overly blunt. So when he started listing off the countless reasons for his mental decline, which included the weight gain and breakup, I made a remark about his injury.I said something along the lines of “If you just didn’t get injured, everything wouldn’t have gone to shit.”He didn’t take that very well and asked that I leave. I tried to defend myself but he was very persistent that I leave.We haven’t talked since and he’s obviously holding it against me. I obviously could’ve worded it different, but I stand by what I said and I think he’s slightly overreacting because it’s simply the truth.I want what’s best for him, and I want us to be able to talk again, but he’s old enough to not get all worked up in my opinion. I also feel he’s been holding my success against me because he was never able to live out our dream and, so far, I have.So, Reddit, Am I the Asshole?**Update: Thanks for all the advice and being upfront with me. Me and Jake are back on speaking terms and everything seems to be fine now. It actually ironic because all it took was me getting an injury in camp (quite minor of an injury) for him to poke fun at me and for us to talk again. All is well.",

I felt like we were very head over heels for each other and I started sleeping over 2 or 3 nights of the week at his place which he was very happy to spend with me. My actual place of residence at the time was my parents living room after having lost my job and no longer able to pay my rent. He was aware of the situation and didn’t seem to mind that I didn’t have my life together atm.Last week, my parents and I had a huge argument where I stormed out the house with my things and had everything in my car. I told my bf, hoping he would let me stay at his place but his reaction to sum it up was “oh that sucks, guess you’ll have to sleep in your car”.It escalated to an argument of differing values. I was expecting him to not have any issue with letting me stay at his place since I was sleeping over often anyway and had a toothbrush there already. He earns very good money and has his own place so I didn’t think it would be a big deal. I wasn’t planning on being a stay at home nuisance forever I’d obviously look for a job asap.His pov was that 1) he’d only met me a month ago and didn’t feel comfortable taking me in 2) he didn’t want to have to feed me and take care of me bc he didn’t sign up for that 3) he told me since I wasn’t  working I’d just be a burden (he also said that if I didn’t get my sh*t together, we wouldn’t work out)This upset me a lot and I told him he was making me feel like he was only there for the good times and dipped in the bad times. He said I was straight up being ridiculous to even consider that he’d take me in. He wanted nothing to do with the situation and refuses to help in any way. In the end he let me stay a night on the condition that I’d go back to my parents house the next day and to him that was him “helping as much as he possibly could”.I’ve noticed he’s an extreme saver and a stingy person in general but I thought it was something I could look past and now I’m not so sure.

	"body" : "My partner(27 NB) and I(27 NB) have been living together for a year now, along with their dog (F Husky). Due to my partner having less mobility from medical issues, I'm usually the one to take the dog on walks rather than just letting her outside.They adopted the dog after finding her living on the streets (our guess is she was abandoned), and her training is somewhat inconsistent. My partner taught her how to sit and go to her kennel, and housetrained her, but not much more than that when we began our relationship.I have more experience training dogs than my partner, so I've been doing my best to add to her training when I can (\"down,\" \"leave it,\" \"shush\", etc). The most difficult thing to train has been getting her to go a particular direction when we're on a walk. She doesn't know \"heel\" or \"follow,\" and we've had little luck training her in either command.Recently, I was taking her on a walk, and I noticed a rabbit sitting in the direction we were going, with foliage nearby that it could easily hide in. Since we'd end up startling it anyway, I had the idea to use another trick I'd been trying to teach her (\"look\", previously used to point out dropped food that she could safely eat) to get her to notice and hopefully chase it. I combined it with various body language (snapping head to a direction, acting like I was about to run) while I pointed towards the rabbit to hopefully get her to notice it, and let her instincts go from there.It worked, and we ended up running after the rabbit for a while before it hid in foliage that I wouldn't let her try to crawl under. We ended up going around the block once due to her trying to sniff out where the rabbit went and me not having the heart to stop her, and we ended up spotting either the same unlucky rabbit or a different one around the same spot where we lost track of the first one, with me repeating the \"look!\" and point to start up another short chase.I've since managed to get her to run in arbitrary directions by pointing, repeating body language, and calling \"look,\" and told the story of the original rabbit chase to my partner, who found the incident funny, but reminded me not to let her actually catch anything. I wouldn't allow that anyway, for several reasons, and the rabbit could easily outrun me/a dog leashed to me.I told this story to a friend a while ago, who didn't find it as amusing as the two of us did. They expressed the opinion that this was cruel to the rabbit, and that I shouldn't encourage the dog to chase it. I said that I would never have let the dog actually catch or harm any wildlife, and that in the grand scheme of things, an additional scare or two wasn't going to matter to a prey animal. The friend didn't press the issue, but I've been thinking back on it, and wondering if letting the dog chase wildlife on purpose was maybe a bit too much.AITA for allowing/encouraging a dog to chase wildlife, even if I had no intention of letting her actually harm/catch anything?Edit: Looks like I'm TAH on this one. Fair enough, I won't contest the judgement, but for everyone saying \"don't teach your dog to chase small animals,\" that ship has long since sailed. I mentioned that she was adopted off of living on the streets in the post already. How do you think she got food while living wild? If 5+ years of not letting her chase anything up until this one incident hasn't changed her inclination to go after squirrels, birds, and rabbits any time she sees them, I doubt she'll ever be trained out of it. I'll just continue to pull the leash short when I spot any wildlife she might try to go after in the future.",

Now, the house we lived in before was on a busy road where it wasn't safe to ride a bike, so we didn't have one. Now that they can have one, they're curious about them and I had been planning on getting the boys their own bike and scooter for the holidays. So, it's not uncommon for the kids to take a toy out of one of their yards (whether they live there or not) and then return them. On this particular day, my two were outside and took a bike and scooter to try out. The mother of the kids living in this house sent me footage of the boys taking these items and then returning them. The front wheel of the scooter was broken and she claimed they couldn't find the bike. My husband went over to their house and was able to fix the wheel of the scooter in less than 5 minutes. I talked to my oldest and asked him about the bike and he had told me he returned it, but saw another kid he didn't know take it and ride it. We did still look all over the neighborhood for the bike and we couldn't find it either. My husband and I did talk to the boys (5 and 7) about this and told them that, while we know they tried to return it, they're not to take anything from anyones yard again. They had not done anything like this before and they understood and haven't done anything like this since. A couple of days later, the mother came knocking on my door demanding I either replace the bike or pay her for it. I explained to her that the video she sent me clearly showed my kids returning the bike and scooter and that we had already fixed the scooter and helped look for the bike, but I am not responsible if another kid took the bike after my kid returned it. She insisted I am and that I need to replace it or reimburse her for its value. I refused and told her that I took responsibility for my kids actions to the best of my ability. The bike was returned right to where it was found (the middle of her yard). Why is she not looking for the other kid who took her son's bike after mine returned it? She left in a huff, mumbling something.My husband thinks we should go and find a cheap bike and take it to them to keep the peace.

	"body" : "A few months ago, I [37m] had a major car accident that totaled the car I had been driving for nearly 20 years. I recently received my full insurance settlement from the person who caused the accident and was finally in a position where I could purchase a new car.My girlfriend [31f], Jen, is quite the gearhead and was excited about the prospect of going car shopping with me. We both shopped around for various dealerships and found one with a make/model that I wanted to buy.On Saturday we went to the dealership planning on pulling the trigger on the car. I was introduced to a saleswoman named Claire. Claire was extremely professional and answered all of our questions about the car, but only to Jen. I would ask her something and she'd answer to Jen. Everything she said was said looking at Jen. I first gently reminded her that I was the one who would be buying the car, but she just kind of said \"Oh OK\" and continued exactly what she was doing.What irritated me the most was when Claire offered to let us (well, Jen) to go for a short test drive. We took her up on the offer. When I was trying to climb into the driver's seat she said, \"Oh, I thought Jen was driving?\" I reminded her, for the third time by that point, that I was the person who would be buying the car. Maybe I said it a bit strongly because the test drive was a bit awkward.When we got back I told Claire that I'd have to think about it a bit. Jen was surprised and asked me why, to which I responded I just wanted to make sure I was getting the best deal.On Sunday, when Jen was out, I went to a different dealership. The make/model I wanted was in a different color and had a few fewer miles on it, but it was at first $1300 more. The salesman, however, was worlds better than Claire. He treated me with respect. When I told him about the price at the other dealership, he was able to knock $400 off. I bought it then and there.When I got home and told Jen about my purchase, she first asked why I didn't buy the other car. I told her honestly that I didn't really like Claire's professionalism and treatment. She grew increasingly agitated at me and kept trying to debate the issue until I told her it was over and there was no going back. Then she theatrically called Claire in front of me to apologize for wasting her time. I could overhear Claire laughing on the phone that it was OK and that someone else will gladly buy the car for its great deal. Jen still doesn't want to talk to me.Was my reaction disproportionate here?",

	"title" : "AITA for reporting my neighbor’s crying baby to our landlord?",
	"body" : "I 34F live upstairs in a duplex with my two boxer/pitty mixes. I’ve lived here for 5 years (with my ex who recently moved out). Last year my neighbors (31F, 30sM) moved in downstairs after the unit had been empty for a while. They were good neighbors until this year when they had a baby. Apparently they had to go through ivf and had a bunch of miscarriages, she posted all about it on Facebook. I thought that was TMI but whatever. I’m only her Facebook friend because she added me. She’s made a big deal about being pregnant and it’s been annoying to see but I just ignored her.Anyway since she’s had the baby I’ve had to deal with the crying from downstairs. It’s not as bad as I expected but it still is really annoying. I’ve gone down and knocked on their door a couple of times to tell them to keep the noise down. Every time they apologize and blame their baby but nothing has changed. I got fed up and reported them to our landlord for making too much noise. The landlord talked to my neighbors who are now turning it around on me, saying my dogs are too loud and I play music at night that wakes their baby up. My dogs aren’t that loud and hardly ever bark when I’m home. I got annoyed and went down to talk to my neighbor about it and she got really nasty with me, and blamed me and my dogs for “always” waking up her baby.She said they can hear every one of mine and my dogs footsteps and the dogs nails on the floor specifically, that my dogs bark the whole time I’m not home during the day, and that I put my music up too loud at night. I told her I can’t make my dogs not bark when I’m out, and that they’re dogs on hardwood floors and that I didn’t know what she expected living in a downstairs unit. I also told her I’m allowed to have people over and my music on whenever I want in my home. I don’t think it’s fair to ask me to change my life when I’m not the one who had a baby.My neighbor got an attitude and told me she was only asking for me to be “respectful of our shared space” and brought up hearing an argument I had with my ex a few weeks ago. I admit it was a little loud but it wasn’t that big of a deal. I laughed and told her that pretty much went out the window when she had a baby but she shut the door in my face. I reported the whole conversation to my landlord so there’s a record of my complaints because I want them and that baby out of here! When I was telling a friend about what was happening she told me I was being a major asshole to “struggling new parents” but I think that’s their problem and not mine. But I wanted to get some unbiased feedback because that friend is usually a little overemotional for my taste.",

	"body" : "So I made a bit of a backup account to see if I'm really TA here, since I've been wondering if I am. Hopefully I did this right and I'm not violating any rules here.A bit of 'backstory' on the situation and how it got up to this point: I really care about animals, like, alot. And in my research about veganism I thought about it and decided I wanted to go vegan, now my parent seemed on-board with cutting most meats out of our diet and having me be a vegetarian while she eats the occasional meat here and there and we continue eating animal products. She won't stop fully eating meat because she seems to believe that it's necessary for \"keeping populations down\", but that's a story for another day I think, but she's still fine with me being vegetarian.Although after I recently told her I want to fully convert to veganism due to the whole animal product industry being harmful, that's where the problems and arguments started... She basically started up the argument that I can't go fully vegan because 'she doesn't want to give up animal products and we do not have money for the both of us to be on different diets' (Although for extra backstory, we once had to live with my sibling who ate alot, I think if we could feed them with how much and how expensive they ate (I think they ate alot of meat, and meat is expensive), then we have enough money to manage my mother being an omnivore and for me to be a vegan/herbivore. Given our money situation hasn't altered at all/much within these past few months/year, if anything it's gotten better.)So I tried to encourage her to watch a couple videos on it and even told her I could link her a couple videos about the dairy/meat industry to see if that might change her mind on me being vegan at the very least, even if I couldn't ever convince her to be vegan. And this just resulted in everything going bad and another argument happening, of her trying to convince me that the meat/dairy industry is needed, and that all the vegan arguments are \"easily debunkable\" and I'm (along with other vegans I guess) \"shoving my veganism down her throat and forcing her and other people to be vegan\" yet she couldn't even debunk one of my arguments with real logic when I asked her to, her only argument was that \"It's required to keep overpopulation down\", that \"the bible says so\" I guess, that \"we can't get the proper proteins and nutrients required if we're vegan\", and that her \"grandfather was a farmer that never abused animals like that\" or something along those lines; she refused to listen to me and kept interrupting me every single time I tried to bring up a real argument to defend my views, she kept insisting and reinforcing the same arguments over and over again for \"why the meat/dairy industry is required\" even when I try my best to explain to her that it isn't.So, Reddit, AITA?",

She had just gotten out of a relationship as well because she discovered that her ex was gay and cheated with a guy, so we hit it off. She confessed to be a virgin and I got intrigued, I confessed that I gave her a lot of attention and took her on dates for about 4 months until we started dating, I wasn’t feeling ready for a relationship and I told her and she was fine with that, and then we discussed sex, she told me that she felt ready and would like. To be her first. We did it on a hot summer afternoon and two times more, but after that I confess to having lost interest in her as I just fucked her and missed my ex. So we went on another date that was a disaster since she didn’t pay for her meal and then didn’t pay gas as I dropped her off by her house.I didn’t want to call her again so I tried to be as rude to her as I could, and then she just told me to stay away for her as I just used her and then it ended. Didn’t feel anything until she started dating another guy 2 months after that. Then, I got quite upset and I fucked up by telling my male and female friends that she was a virgin, they I fucked her and she didn’t pay me gas and her meal, then my friends fucked up by telling everyone on a 5 km radius about that, until it got to her and then she told me I was the worst thing that ever happened to her and many other hurtful things. I denied the rumors and then scolded my friends but it was too late. I recognize to having felt relief as she was very intense and wanted me to treat her as a girlfriend and demanded too much of me, then stopped thinking about her as I met someone else. She blocked me on every social media available until 1 year ago, then I followed her even though she didn’t follow me.I dated this other girl for 2 years but we ended things, and after that I have been thinking about Luna constantly, it’s kinda strange because I remember that I was annoyed by her and her intensity and only being interested in sex with her but lately I see her posts and found her even more beautiful and interesting than before, she has a boyfriend and just moved with him and she feels different, I wouldn’t be able to describe how she is now but I am constantly thinking about her and dreaming about her.I felt like I need to tell her how I feel so I have been DM her saying that I want to speak with her but she leaves me in read always, until a day came and she just told me to stop bugging her as I am an AH who deserves nothing for her.

	"body" : "So me and Everett broke up because of his sister. She’s insufferable.We’re HS students. His dad is gone from work for weeks at a time, leaving him to look after the house and his little sister. His dad is a pretty messed up guy with alcohol issues and has been a bad dad since his wife passed away when Ev was 8. He cooks for her, cleans after her, puts her to bed, gets her to school, makes sure she does her homework, etc. He works and pays his share of the bills.I liked how he seemed grown up. When the teacher asked our class what being a man meant he gave the only good answer. He said it means taking care of the people that you love no matter what. It was a very him answer, and everyone would talk about how sweet it was, that this 6 ft guy cared so deeply about his little sister but I quickly learned she was insufferable.I remember going over to his house one night and it was 10pm and he had HS and had gotten off of work. She didn’t like the meal he cooked for dinner and wanted to eat something else. He says won’t you just eat it? Just for tonight? I’m really tired. She says no, I’d rather starve. He relents and makes her a different dish.I said, “You know, my brother would have laughed in my face if I pulled that.” Well, he wouldn’t be cooking for me in the first place but. She said, “Is your brother mean? Does he not care about family?” She’s seemed entitled to me, and she’s 12. Your brother doesn’t have to do shit for you.She would also be too tired when he asked if she wanted to help with laundry, etc. I said she was lazy, and he got defensive and said she was 12 and exhausted from school. I would tell him she seems ungrateful, and he said you can’t expect a 12 year old to be grateful to be looked after, she didn’t ask to be alive. It really frustrating that he denied all criticism of her, and we got into a big fight about it where I called her spoiled and said she needed to go into foster care if her dad won’t look after her, and he kicked me out and broke up with me.I could have seen myself marrying him, and he broke it off just like that. To make matters worse he is now dating his best friend, a total pushover that never criticizes him and dotes on his sister. Ofc.I started telling everyone under the sun about how horrible his sister is and how entitled & bratty she is. She was the reason I lost him after all. I definitely got him pissed off about it a few times. But mostly he just ignored my existence. Well, I just find out his sister had untreated type one diabetes and is being hospitalized for it.It hit me that might have been the reason she was so bratty, and I don’t know how to feel about it. I do feel a little bad because I think having a disease like that would suck. But was I wrong? Are her actions justified now because she had diabetes? AITA?",

	"body" : "AITA for considering taking my children’s grandparents to court for maintenance ?So long story short, my children’s father passed away in late 2019 leaving me to look after 2 babies (my oldest turned 1 a week after he passed and I was 6 months pregnant with my youngest). My oldest turned 5 now and youngest will be 4 in January.I wasn’t working at the time so his parents let me stay there with the kids until I got a job again in February 2021. His father had me and the kids put onto a medical aid in 2020 since they could no longer be on their dads, which he still pays for. I moved out a few months later but gave money every month for letting us stay there.They also let me use her old car.In 2022 after moving out a child psychologist recommended I put my oldest into a school, my salary at the time was not very big and on children’s grandmother’s recommendation (after me explicitly telling them that I could not afford it) my son was enrolled into a very costly private pre-primary school. I only paid a portion (just under half) of his school fees. This year my other son had to join the same school and I contribute about 1/3 to the fees. The school recommended my child do sports as he is extremely busy and struggles with impulse control, I pay all his extra murals myself. The kids stay with me permanently and see their grandparents almost once every weekend because I am not trying to be a horrible “ex” and a firm believer that they are still family. I got married in September 2023.It came out that my oldest son has been overexposed to age inappropriate content on YouTube at the grandparents house. The school has been trying to help with the kids by means of a round table discussion and sending both of them to OT on their account but it’s still occurring. The school then recommended I send my oldest for an emotional evaluation at a psychologist who stated she recommends ds my children go to after care to create a more stable routine and less of being given a phone without supervision.This is an expense I just can’t incur because ase of finances so I sent the details to the grandparents with the aim of having a discussion about it when we discuss 2024 school fees. The grandfather calls me and argues with me that my husband and I need to make a plan because he can’t keep paying for everything (he still pays my medical aid and contributes to the kids school but also his 25 year old daughters and gives her a monthly allowance and she wants to get married in Thailand in March) because he needs to plan for his old age.

After telling her she confided in my dad who then proceeded to tell me how unnatural it was and how such a thing didnt exist. To make things worse they then took me to a therapist who I asked for puberty blockers, the therapist's response being that such medication did not exist. This made me go back into the closet for the next 4 agonizing years where I went through hell and exhibited dangerous behavior which this sub doesnt let me get into.This brings us to the present where after telling my mom again at 16, I waited ANOTHER agonizing 9 months of puberty through appointments and her coming to terms with it until i got my first therapist appointment which eventually ended up with me beginning treatment shy of 3 months before turning 18. Having gone through puberty has traumatized me to say the least and Ive brought up the fact that I hold a grudge against her decision all those years ago to try and resolve it and really to get an apology. Last two times ive brought this up she's said that: I'm ungrateful for not appreciating the great mother she is(and i recognize that in all aspects not trans related she is an exemplary mom), that she's done way better than what other parents would've done, that she didnt know what being trans was and saw no signs, that she was looking to help me the best way she could, and that shes been through worse than me and I dont know what true suffering is like. At that point I exploded and told her its her and my dads fault Im so traumatized, scarred, and (pre-treatment) so depressed to the point where my gpa is so low Im going to have to do monumental efforts to climb back up and not regret being alive every walking second picturing what couldve been.

Both my wife and I are Indian-americans, we both were born in the U.S. but our parents emigrated here from India. We met in college, didn't really date in the traditional way but we were pretty good friends and then after our college and I got settled, through the encouragement of both of our parents we decided to get married. Yes I know it's pretty weird from a Western perspective, and looking back on it, I regret it mainly because we didn't get to have the chance to have important conversations about faith. It was merely enough that we liked each other and that our families had the same caste and our horoscopes matched. I do wish either one of us was a bit more strong willed and talked about it without our parents in the room, but at the time we just went along with it with our parents' gentle forcing.We both were brought up in Hindu families but in college I converted to Islam. I took the shahada because I was lonely and felt isolated from the practice of Hinduism, I didn't feel a connection to God and I honestly felt I was running through the motions, practicing loosely related customs and doing pujas that taken all together seemed connected in one faith but I didn't feel it. I then explored other religions and found Islam.The problem is that my parents and her parents would absolutely flip out. My wife is not super Hindu, like I'd say she is culturally hindu but not really in the ideology of fully believing in the Gods. But we started to talk about names, and we are having a problem, she wants a Hindu name, but the idea just kind of turns me off since it's not my religion and I want to name my son a name from our faith. I want our baby to have an Islamic name,. But I can't really say that, so I've been suggesting American names under the pretext that our kid will have an easier time not getting bullied by having an ethnic name, so I said since we both are basically Americans having spent all our life here, it's not that big of a deal, but she disagrees with me. We are having a lot of tension due to this so I'm considering just spilling the beans, but I know she'll tell her parents and they will say that I cheated their daughter and didn't represent myself properly and that I trapped her by not saying I wasn't hindu. I don't think I am the asshole though because my wife isn't particularly religious so I don't think she would mind as much but at the same time I'm worried she'll be mad because I'm concealing something this big from her, and I'm losing sleep over this.",

I support her choice.However, I got home from work at 6 am and went to have a shower. It was filled with her hair in the drain where she had not cleaned it out. Slightly frustrating, but, I cleaned it out.I then went into the kitchen after my shower to make something to eat before I went to bed. I needed the cheese grater, but it was sitting in the sink, unwashed along with the other utensils she had used the night before to make herself some food. Again, slightly frustrating, but I washed the cheese grater and the rest of the stuff in the sink. I made my food, and then went to bed.Later that evening, I woke up before I had to go back to work that same day, a pair of her shoes were left in the middle of the doorway and I tripped over them. I frustratedly kicked them to the side to which she replied “what’s wrong”. I told her about the three little things and how they were no problem in the grand scheme of things, but I would appreciate it if she tidied up after herself a little bit.She got angry at me and told me she can’t physically bend down to clean the shower drain or pick her shoes up, it hurts her back. I said that’s fair enough, if she needs help, I will do it, but little things build up sometimes and after working for 12 hours, it is a bit frustrating.She told me I am not the only person who works, and reminded me that she is also still working. I told her that is by choice and if she needs to take the time off, she can do just that. Again, I reminded her that she told me she would only work if she was physically able to, and if she is having back troubles, she should really consider a break.She got mad and called me an asshole saying I am throwing it back in her face and that she is trying to help me by working so that the financial issues don’t land on me. But for one, we have no financial issues, we are able to live comfortably, even with her pay being reduced back to almost nothing due to maternity pay being so poor in my country.I feel bad but I don’t know what to do, or how to approach this conversation with her.AITA?",

This is temporary until the autumn, we hope. I work an average of 50 hours a week including a minimum of 1-2 saturdays a month to make up for the current shortfall in income.She just got home from a 4 day vacay with two girlfriends to the spa which she paid for with her own money (money the government sends her monthly for the kids). Her friends also chipped in for her as she couldnt afford it on her own. The two boys have been at grandmas for the 4 days while i worked, including the saturday.She comes home and exclaims how hard it is to keep the house clean, and that she would like to buy a roomba and expects me to pay for at least half because \"its for the house, and not specifically for her.\" She views it like buying a dishwasher.I was glad for her to go away on a trip after covid and being at home alone with the kids for months on end. She needed a break. But i resent her asking for me to chip in on a robot to vacuum the floors when she is at home all day and we are currently on a tight budget that requires me working loads of over time. I told her she should save for that instead of spa get-aways if thats where her priorities are.She struggles with being a stay-at-home mom and is more used to being a working professional.

She only wants the roomba for the main floor where the kitchen is.

These jars are usually rather difficult to open, so I kind of expected her to hand the jar to me or my son to open.  Instead, she set it on the table and used the blunt end of a table knife to whack around its lid a few times.  She then picked it up and opened it, no problem.  We'd all watched this deft performance, and I said  (at least, this is what I remember saying) \"You see, son, this is a woman's way to open the jar.  Worked great.  If you or I had tried that, we probably would have broken it.\"  (you have to understand, her whacks weren't simple taps).  I was going to say more, but my daughter immediately got offended.  She claimed my remark was misogynistic.  Surprised, I said it certainly wasn't, and that I was picturing my son or myself straining to open the jar -- our manhood on the line!This was all supposed to be a joke at my son and my expense (and the time I'd tried tapping the lid to open it, it didn't work, so I'd tapped harder until by the time I could get it open, the mouth of the jar had actually cracked).  But my daughter said my remark sure sounded misogynistic.  \"Who here thinks that sounded misogynistic?\" she asked.  All four of them raised their hands.This hurt, because I felt they should all know me well enough not to interpret it that way, and it immediately made me wonder if I'd said it differently than I'd thought, or worse, that even knowing me, they thought I was a misogynist.  I tried to explain more, but I was a little flustered because I was pretty surprised at how the conversation was going and felt defensive.  No good.  My daughter expected an apology.At this point I was annoyed and a bit offended.  \"Apologize for what?  For you misinterpreting what I said?  Don't you think you should have let me finish what I was saying before assuming the worst?  It seems to me that's your problem, not mine.  Who's more at fault, a people who say things badly or people who don't work hard enough to try to understand what they're trying to say?\"She said \"See, that's what's wrong with people these days, they say or do something wrong and instead of apologizing they double down and blame everybody else\", and got up and left the table.I can see her point, but I can see mine too.  I see public figures bending over backwards to apologize for things they said that others interpreted in the worst possible way, and it bothers me that they should be held hostage that way.  On the other hand, I see public figures (one in particular) who say offensive things and when called on it, double down to make it even more offensive, and that bothers me just as much or more.What do you think?

I have always looked much younger than my actual age and used to like to tell people how old I really was for the shock value and also for the boost to my self esteem, but I stopped doing this around 35 when I was no longer passing for 22 anymore lol.  In the past year I’ve noticed that despite still looking really good for my age that I am starting to look closer to the age I really am (blame 3 kids, full time job and buckets of stress!).  For some reason turning 40 is not setting well with me and so I’ve just chosen to ignore this birthday, I do not want to celebrate it or acknowledge it - and I thought my husband understood this but apparently I was mistaken.The other night we were returning from a concert with friends and one of his male friends out of nowhere asked me my age.  I tried skirting the question and tried getting out of answering with humor - I jokingly scolded him by saying “you never ask a lady her age”, and when he said he meant no disrespect but that he assumed I am probably close to his age (he is 34).  Before I could say something so end the questioning my husband turns to this man’s wife and announces that I will be 40 at the end of the month.I was pissed and mortified!  Not only did he not take my cues of not saying my age, he informs not only this man but also his gossip queen wife (who is still a spring chicken in her 20’s) of my age!  I got mad at him, which in turn he got mad at me and now I’m questioning am I the asshole?  I am not the only women who lies about their age, and definitely not the only one sensitive about it and especially when it is the dreaded big 4-0!!!  He does not understand the concept of this and thinks I’m crazy for being pissed off - while I think he’s an idiot for not realizing that based on my answers to the question that I wanted it to be a secret!!!  He doesn’t think he did ANYTHING wrong in this situation.Side argument:  he also thinks that I don’t want people to know my actual age because then I won’t be considered attractive to them.  I admitted that this is true, and that subconsciously everyone wants to be considered desirable to which he thinks I should not want or try to be desirable to anyone but him.  I am quiet and reserved and not flirty or flaunting so I’m not looking for attention from others, but I do care about how I look and work hard to look good - if I look good I feel good.  This kind of makes me wonder if he purposely wants to sabotage my self esteem….  And yes, I have struggled with self esteem issues my entire life - and being with my husband for 22 years he is aware of this (a lot of my issue over getting older is growing up in a male dominated atmosphere - 5 brothers so I have heard my share of disgusting conversations and comments about women, though my brothers are especially repulsive and I hope they do not represent the majority of men with their opinions).

My dad made a comment saying that he liked Sarah because she wasn’t like the other immigrants from Eastern Europe who come to steal jobs.Sarah didn’t take kindly to that and confronted him about what he meant.

She said she wasn't comfortable with that as I was recovering from my C - section, I wasn't in condition to do such a long hike and also had a 1 month old.I sort of pressed that I wanted to go, but agreed the trail wasn't the best and I had found friendlier trails that would work for me.Once my husband and I realized we didn't like the idea of him being alone with our child for so long, I told my friend with everything going on maybe it would be best if we made it a family vacation and push up intense hiking next year. I had found family friendly activities and parks. She told me to have fun, but she's going to do what was planned, because it was absurd I would expect her to change her whole vacation to accommodate me. I let her know any good friend would and would also understand the situation. Unsurprisingly, we never went.She did, post a ton of pictures, and captioned one with 'Nothing Could Stop Me Getting Here' when she reached the summit.In my public comment I told her I was excited for me to get there too, but I achieved the biggest accomplishment this year on being a mom, and nothing would ever come between that. And thanks for being such a good friend and respecting that /sShe blocked me after that.AITA?",

My wife is 18 weeks pregnant and understandably needs to use the bathroom frequently at night, and she’s opted to use ours instead of the guest one because ours is closer and she’s able to fall back to sleep quicker after.But I’ve been having trouble sleeping because of the noise of her using our bedroom’s bathroom, so I asked her if she could use the guest bathroom instead of ours. She got upset at me for even asking and told me it’s too far to walk and it would disrupt her sleep even more. She asked me why I would want to make her life harder at the minute, but I told her I didn’t really think it was a huge ask. We  went back and forth about it and eventually she just said she’s going to use our bathroom and she doesn’t care if my sleep gets interrupted because of it. I told her that was fine but I’m going to sleep in the guest room instead so I can actually sleep without being woken up multiple times. I just think it’s a pretty small thing to ask of her and I don’t see why both our sleep should be interrupted because of her.",

We arrive say hi to everyone and we ask where is Marcus and his wife \"Lindsay\" says he's outback still grilling. I walk out back to say hi and he is surprisingly shirtless. Granted it was 95 degrees in the shade that day, so I get it but still. He had a major glo up. He had lost 40 lbs. He had muscle definition, etc. I embarrassed myself. I went to hug him and he just fist bumped me, \"I'm sweaty\". And I said \"I don't care\" and hugged him anyway. I told him he looked great and left it at that. He didn't seem uncomfortable.When he came inside after he had finished grilling everything, he stopped at the fridge for a drink where I was talking to Lindsay. He totally caught me checking him out, and borderline sprinted upstairs joking to his wife, \"I think I'm indecent\". So here's where I may have messed up just a bit. I asked \"When did Marcus become gorgeous\". I expected playful banter with my SIL, who I've known for 15 years. Nope. She said he always has been and called me a \"little shallow for just noticing now\". I don't want him, trust me. But her saying that made me subconsciously pay him more attention.Add in the fact that I had already pregamed before we got there and drank a lot of wine while there. Honestly though, it should be really no big deal. Marcus always seemed a little unsure of himself physically, so what is wrong with a little confidence overload?

We are both really interested in creative writing, and actually met at a Fiction Writing workshop hosted by our English DepartmentThe difference is that I am more invested in writing mature coming of age family dramas that draw heavily from my personal experiences, so I'd like to say that I put a lot of thought in my writing and my writing involves really deep and meaningful themes, while my girlfriend writes more \"pulpy\" fantasy/sci fi fiction. I'm not really judging her per se, it's just how everyone(including me) sees her writing, but I'm sure she's great at coming up with story ideas because she always has some new fun little twist popping up in her head to the point where she keeps a notebook near the bathroom to write down ideas she gets in the shower, but I'm more deliberate, but each to their own I guess.Anyways, so my girlfriend has finished a first draft of her fantasy novel, she told me it's in the vein of Lord of the Rings. To be quite honest, my memories of high fantasy novels like that one and the Belgariad are a bit hazy, mostly because I outgrew them by the age of 12 because they just seemed a little silly for me, no judgement of course, it's just hard to get invested in such fantastical and at times, whimsical stories about orcs and Mordor.But I wanted to be a supportive partner so I started it, and it was kind of rough. I tend to prefer well fleshed out characters and thoughtful moments of introspection in my writing that really strike a nerve with the reader, but I just saw rambling and extensive descriptions of the landscape and the trees or the chainmail the warriors would wear. But I bore through it and finished half of the novel.That was 2 days ago. Yesterday, my girlfriend hands me a giant stack of loose leaf papers, telling me that apparently she *forgot* to hand me her world building notes, stuff she uses to keep track of all of this, and asked me to reference it as I read.To be quite honest, this was too much to ask. I have my own life and I can't always be at her beck and call, I was fine reading the novel, but I'm just not that into fantasy stuff to cross reference a language bank she created, it's just all a bit dorky for me.I did offer some advice on avoiding purple prose, shortening and making the descriptions a bit more concise to spend some time more on elucidating the mental state of the characters, but she really didn't want to hear it and is now acting kind of weird.

We’ve all known each other for a year.None of us is a smoker, but I smoke a couple of cigarettes from time to time, very rarely. I hadn’t smoked one in over 2 years, actually. I asked Jessica if I could smoke and everyone told me to please go on the balcony.While I was smoking, I was standing between the balcony door and the living room so I could also talk to my friends and hear what they say. Some smoke inevitably got into the room.Ava has been suffering from migraines for a long time and her triggers are unclear, it’s mostly genetic. She mentioned periods, stress and smoke to be her main triggers. She said she didn’t have a problem in the past, but nowadays she can’t even walk behind someone who smokes on the street. She takes medication, though. We knew all of this in advance because there were situations when Ava had to go to the ER because of migraines.Well, it seems like my smoking triggered a migraine and she ended up throwing up in the bathroom before the medication kicked in. She was clearly upset when she went home but then she felt better.Now, everyone’s blaming me because I could have just stood further away on the balcony or not smoked at all. I disagree, it was literally 3 minutes and almost no smoke got into the apartment, plus Ava could have just gone to the bathroom or to another room.

	"title" : "AITA for encouraging good grammar for my wife?",
	"body" : "Please excuse grammar/spelling mistakes as I type this on my phone. That would be pretty ironic.To preface, I grew up in a southern state and so was the constant butt of education and redneck jokes. My wife had the same upbringing. I love her very much but can feel our paths diverging. Let me explain how.We like to consider ourselves as more educated than other members of the home state. We both have high paying jobs at the same company/ same department (think big tech companies) and a nice house. We have risen above what maybe would have been our natural station (a good job in my hometown was considered held by the cemetery caretaker, for example, so we've risen far). We have made friends with coworkers in our new state who do not share our redneck accents. I have been able to mask my accent well and use proper grammar most of the time. I tell our new friends that we are from California and moved for the job.My wife however has not had as much success with hiding her accent. She constantly says \"good\" instead of \"well\". It has even started to grate my ears whenever I hear her say it. She also says \"y'all\" and \"howdy\" decently often. She even let out a \"darn tootin'\" when in conversation with our VP at dinner the other night and I almost died. She laughed like a braying mule but all the others at the table only gave nervous chuckles and averted their eyes from meeting mine. The VP didn't make anymore jokes after that and the rest of the dinner was very awkward.The other night I read her diary when she was in the restroom with a touch of food poisoning. I found her reddit account information. I know I shouldn't be the one to correct her on her grammar as I don't want to drive a wedge between us. Instead, I created several throw away accounts and follow her profile to read her comments. On comments with bad grammar, I say things like \"wow you must have been born in (insert our home state) because your English is about as bad as your states education system\" and other comments like \"you won't get too far sounding like a hick\".She has been distraught by these comments. I am questioning whether or not I have done the right thing, but to quote MacBeth I feel so far stepped in blood that to go back would be harder than going forward (or something to that effect). So I doubled down and made 8 more fake profiles.Keeping up with her comments has negatively affected both hers and mine own effectiveness at work because she is constantly in a bad mood and I am constantly distracted by refreshing reddit for new comments. However, her grammar has marginally improved. I've noticed my coworkers do not seem to stand in groups of three or four at the water-cooler and point at her anymore in between sips of coffeeSo while my plan seems to have worked to some extent, I feel like I have done something terrible. Should I tell her the truth of the matter? Should I increase the fake profiles to 16? I am running out of additional ideas for new email addresses. I guess most importantly, am I the ah?Edit: For clarification I love my wife and stand by her in pretty much every other aspect of our marriage. To those asking \"why did you marry her if you don't like her accent\" please remember that we both had the same accent at time of marriage and I didn't think anything about it until we moved. You are likely reading too far into other aspects of our marriage if you think this post extends beyond me simply making fake profiles and encouraging her.",

However, I personally am not comfortable with letting another grown man live in my home while contributing nothing to the world, even if this was the previous arrangement he had with his husband it is not an arrangement he has with me.His response was to claim it would be too much of a burden on him to work outside of the home. I have offered to help him by co-signing on a car, but he has repeatedly refused citing finances are not an issue. Instead, he allows my wife to drive him places. He also claims he cannot work from home because he cannot keep traditional working hours or commit to a set schedule. To him, paying rent to me should be enough. I suspect that in his mind, because of his pension and the money from the sale of his previous property and funds left to him by his late spouse, he doesn't feel a need to work.I expressed to him that I feel it’s time to leave this mindset behind. I am trying to do what is best for him, and after all this is my house and I set the rules I please. After trying to set him straight I told him he needs to get a job or he’s out of my home.

She said she started using when she was 13. And at that point although she had been clean for a year, it was something she very much still struggled with. She told me that while my body is my own, that if I chose to get high she couldn’t be around me while I did it, and was also not in a place to take care of me during or after and it’s likely that anything like that will always trigger her to a degree. I told her that I smoke several times a week (3-4) and she said that she didn’t want to be around me at those times, which is fine since we lived separately. So for a few hours 3-4 times a week I would not be with or be in contact with her.Yesterday after a long day I was going to smoke some to blow off some steam in our bedroom while I played some games. She walked in and freaked out saying that I can’t do that in our room. I told her I was stressed and that I needed to relax and I can do it in my own bedroom if I want. She told me that she was also stressed because her job is extremely stressful (she is CCO of a local popular organisation) and she doesn’t want to come home to being triggered because the smell clings to the bedding. I told her it’s not my problem if she’s triggered by a little smoking, it’s not like it’s hard drugs and she knew I did this before we moved in together and I won’t stop for her. She said that she’s not asking me to stop, but she assumed that I’d have the decency to either continue when she’s not home or do it in the man cave she let me set up in her garage and that it doesn’t matter what it is, that all things of that type are still a trigger for her and she’s always made that extremely clear.

As anyone who has done this knows, from time to time every dog will stop to do its business. Today was a normal day, in all respects but one.I religiously carry poop bags (\"biodegradable\" ones, though what they REALLY are is \"industrially compostable\", a thing which from what I can tell never actually happens) to pick up my dog's leavings. I did that today, and as I usually do, I dropped it in the nearest house's easily-available trash can (sitting in the driveway). I have done this many times, and nobody has ever said a thing to me.Today, as I was walking back to the sidewalk (a journey of roughly 10 meters), the owner of the house returned in their vehicle and asked if I had put dog poop in their trash can. I said yes, not thinking anything of it. This person proceeded to tell me that THEY didn't have a dog, and THEY didn't want my dog's poop in their trash can, and to never do that again. I was blown away. I have known this person for essentially my entire life, as I grew up two houses down the street from this person.

I replied that it was better than leaving the poop on their grass, but they were not swayed.Reddit, I have always considered this to be part of the social contract; I bag and remove my dog's poop, and you allow me to put the bagged poop in your trash can. I have never and would never go over a fence or barrier, nor would I go through a gate, even an open one, but many people keep trash cans in front of their house, and I never thought twice about using it so I didn't have to carry the bag a couple miles back home.Am I doing the wrong thing?

I currently live in a city where there is projected to be a hurricane tomorrow, as well as a storm surge and flooding, at varying degrees of intensity for almost 24 hours. The power is very likely to go out. This means that I won’t be able to go outside from late tomorrow morning to Sunday, with probably at least half a day with both no power and the storm hitting at the same time. My partner chose tomorrow to go on a camping trip without cell service.I let him know that I’m upset that he is going tomorrow because it makes me feel like he doesn’t care to check in on me or care very much about my comfort (or to see if I’m safe but I didn’t mention that cuz it’s a low blow and I’ll almost certainly be ok where I am). This is probably selfish but I’d honestly just love to kill time and distract myself from anxiety by talking to him on the phone over text or call.He says we’re on opposite sides of the country and there’s nothing he can do, and that this is the ‘last time’ he can really go camping because he’s leaving there in 3 weeks. He asked “don’t you want me to have fun?”. He’s going to a show less than a two hour drive away with friends and is the only one camping there that night. Everyone else is coming back. I respect that he might want to have a solo camping night, but would prefer if he chose any other possible day.I would love to know if I’m being over sensitive about this. I might be overdoing my anxiety with the storm and being cooped up inside, and on a macro scale he is right that there’s little he can do. Are my expectations of him too high? Is it codependent to want your partner accessible for an event like this? Effectively, am I the asshole for desiring this of him?TL;DR:Big, long, hurricane/storm tomorrow in my town and long distance partner is going camping without service. AITA for wanting him to stay in reception to talk at times during the storm and disappointment he’s going camping?Thanks everyone!",

I decided to call her and see if she'd want to go mini golfing that day any time between then and when it closed which we had about 5 hours before it closed. When I called her she told me she would have to ask her wife, my stepmom, then would call back. I also invited my stepmother along because I had my partner along too. She then called back and said they had too much going on and I asked her what she had going on that couldn't wait a while and all she could come up with was that they had to get groceries. I don't know if this is normal for mom's to push off doing something with their kids on mothers day but it didn't feel very nice to me.

	"title" : "AITA for smoking weed in my garden?",
	"body" : "It's a very long story, but the short of it is my neighbour's complaints of my smoking cannabis is leading me to be evicted.I privately rent a terraced house in the UK. My neighbours I believe own their home. I have a garden, quite enclosed and private. I smoke cannabis outside (in my garden). It's not heavy use (I mix with tobacco). I always smoke outside, never inside.I use it for anxiety. I have a lot of mental health diagnoses unfortunately, and have tried loads of anxiety meds over the years. Diazepam/lorazepam help but of course they can be addictive and it's hard to get them prescribed. I have a consultation with a medical marijuana clinic coming up.Various complaints from the neighbours about the smell of cannabis. From an initial firm (but not rude) note, through to complaining multiple times a day to the estate agents and even calling the police (who tried to force their way in to my home at 2am with paramedics because my neighbour reported I told them I'd harm myself over this, which was not true).I have tried to approach this in a friendly and reasonable way but unfortunately they will not speak to me at all. The only time one neighbour has spoken to me, it's been shouting abuse out the window.. I have no complaints from the neighbour the other side. She even told the police she hasn't noticed any cannabis smell.So... AITA for smoking in my garden? Are they the asshole for getting me evicted for this?EDIT to respond to some common comments:genuinely surprised by the amount of comments saying smoking outside is the rude/dumb thing to do. I must actually be dumb.. Because I didn't for one moment even contemplate that smoking inside would be more considerate. Outside of my own personal preference and being concerned about smoking inside the property (rental contract wise), I just imagined the smell could linger in to a neighbouring property more by being enclosed than in the outside air. So I have definitely learned something I didn't know there which may have affected things!I did respond to them, I did not ignore them. I responded with a polite note, an apology, an explanation and an offer of getting together to chat in person, plus my phone number if that wasn't possible.I did make changes. I started being more cautious where I would smoke, ensuring it's kept to the area in my garden which is most sheltered from their side and putting up some shelter (gazebo type covering with decorative fabric hangings I was hoping would absorb some smell). I always check the windows when I go out to make sure they're closed before smoking, if they're open I wait. I will go out for a walk when it's possible.edibles are not possible due to a medical condition. I was (maybe falsely?) under the impression a vape wouldn't make much difference so hadn't purchased one yet despite doing the research.it's a couple of spliffs a day, maximum. I want to take the edge off my anxiety. (which is severe and I have been seeking medical help including therapy for years, my psych and nurse know of my use and are not concerned), I don't just be high my whole life.It definitely seems I've made some clearly wrong assumptions in my handling of this in some ways, thinking I was doing the right thing when actually I may have been making it worse. So this has been helpful for that if nothing else, thank you!",

	"title" : "AITA for telling my husband I don't want him drinking during my pregnancy.",
	"body" : "I (25f) am pregnant with my husband's (24m) child. It was a bit of a surprise pregnancy especially as my husband did not want to have kids yet, but ironically to the issue, due to a good amount of alcohol around 3 months ago we have found ourselves in this situation.  We have decided that we will keep the child as I am ready to be a mother and have been for awhile and my husband did say he is happy to have the baby.The pregnancy has not been easy, nor fun for me. Due to constantly feeling sick I left my job as my husband makes good enough money to support all of us and I would have left it once the baby comes anyways. To his credit my husband has done a great job supporting me and keeping the house running smoothly while I'm pregnant as I just haven't had the energy or felt good enough to keep a consistent schedule or do a lot of my household duties.However, he does like to drink. Usually he would have a beer or some wine with dinner and if he does anything on the weekends with friends he may have some liquor on top of that. It was fine at first but the liquor and beer especially make me feel nauseous a lot of the time and even when it doesn't seeing him drink (or smelling it afterwards) just makes me feel depressed because I can't partake in that activity and it is just reminding me of what I am giving up.As such I asked him to stop drinking at least during the pregnancy after which we can both drink again and he pushed back. He said he didn't want to give up drinking because it is the one thing he has to just calm him and help him relax after work, making sure the house runs smoothly and my needs are being met. If he hangs out with his friends, they will be drinking and he doesn't want to always have to be the DD or the one who can't \"have as much fun\" as them as he feels he doesn't have any other outlet. This did hurt my feelings as I feel that I should be worth more to him than alcohol and we got in a fight and he's been sleeping in the guest bedroom.AFAIK he hasn't drank in the past few days but he definitely has been more distant with me and instead of hanging out with me he chooses to just go lie down and sleep in the guest room. It hurts me because we are supposed to be a team in this and I'm suffering daily being pregnant so he should be able to lose something too as it's just for a few months.I feel like I might be the asshole because he has been really stressed out and instead of a 50/50 split of duties before the pregnancy we are looking more at around an 80/20 split now and maybe I should just let him have this as an outlet even if it does bother me. On the other hand, we are a team and I feel him giving up the stuff I have to give up would allow him to appreciate my pregnancy more and what I am going through. Plus, now that we are down to one salary it also does save some money. AITA?",

We lived in Melbourne and all of our closest friends and family were people from there. At the end of 2022 my fiance got an unexpected job offer in Perth that was really good money so we moved over. By the time we settled, we had already booked our dream venue and sorted guest accomodation.We didn't know many people in Perth so the people we became friends with were mostly my fiance's colleagues and their partners. I became especially close with three ladies, Jane, Melisa, and Kate. In the meantime, I received notice from a few of my invited guests that they would not be able to make it, so the cards fell perfectly for me to invite my three friends and their partners. They were all really looking forward to it and told me they would attend.Guest accomodation needed to be confirmed 6 weeks in advance, and final numbers for the actual ceremony/reception 4 weeks in advance.Around 12 weeks before the wedding I found out that Kate was pregnant. She had told me previously she would come, but she hadn't formally RSVPd while Jane and Melisa had. I asked her if she was still attending and she told me that she was still suffering from morning sickness despite being halfway through her pregnancy, so she would let me know closer to our wedding date to see if she was feeling better by then.In the meantime, my fiance had become really close to one of his colleagues, John, and wanted to invite him and his partner. We didn't have anymore space at the guest accom but they were happy to sort out their own accom so they could attend.About a week before the RSVP date Kate was supposed to fly back home to spend the holidays with her family. However, her sickness was still really bad so she opted to stay and spend the holidays here instead. That was a much shorter flight then it would be to Bali so if she couldn't handle that, I doubted she would be able to attend our wedding. So I made the decision to offer John and his partner their guest accom so they wouldn't have to pay for their own.I told Kate what I was going to do and wished her all the best with her health and her pregnancy, and told her that if she was feeling better closer to the day she could still attend the wedding, and that we could even cut the RSVP time to two weeks before the date, but they would have to sort their own accom. She was very upset and told me how rude it was to make the decision for her before the RSVP date, and that even if she couldn't make it her partner would have gone.I get where she is coming from, but it was quite obvious that she wouldn't have been well enough to come, and she all but confirmed that in our last conversation. My fiance isn't that close to her partner so it makes more sense for him to have John there instead if Kate couldn't come, since he was much closer to him. So AITA?",

We had an on again off again relationship for about 3 years - due to the fact that my parents thought i was too young to be dating.When we dated, Dave and I would still hang out with Ashley because, quite frankly, she had no other friends. She was always known as the shy, weird girl and because of that she's never had any boy like her back while I, being the prettier friend, always had a lot of guys ask me out.During one of Dave and my breaks (this one was for about 4 or 5 months), he and Ashley became closer and she came up to me one day and told me that she thinks that she's starting to have feelings for Dave and she wanted to tell me first. I had suspected that she liked him for a while and I told her that it was okay.Now, here's where I'm not proud. She told me that on the day before Valentine's Day and when I got home I talked to Dave and told him that i wanted to get back together to see if he liked her back but he agreed and we started dating again.On Valentine's day, Ashley was going to tell Dave how she felt but she accidentally walked in on us making out. I don't remember much of what happened after that but she stopped talking to Dave but we remained friends (we have always been for 16 years now)Dave and I broke up when i was 18 because we didn't really fit well together.Now, fast forward to last week. Dave got an internship at his dream company and a few of our friends threw a little going away party for him.When we got there, Ashley gave him a hug and a kiss on the cheek saying how she was so proud of him and whatnot.I was shocked that she did that. She knew that we dated and broke up but she still hugged him and that got me really angry.I pulled her aside and basically told her that she was out of line for doing that because she's supposed to not like him because we broke up. She got really defensive saying that he is still her friend and she was just \"happy\" for him and there was nothing else going on.I told her that as my best friend she isn't allowed to be friendly with any of my exes and after a while she apologized.But ever since she's been acting weird around me, she'd make excuses not to hang out and if i ask her if something's wrong, she'll say that she's okay and not elaborate.I told my current boyfriend about the whole situation and he said that I shouldn't have gotten mad that she hugged my ex and that it's okay for Ashley to be friendly with him but some of my other friends agree with me that she's in the wrong.AITA here?

When i say something overly offensive, I make sure im saying it to the people with whom I very close with. i tend to be flirty, but only because all the attractive older women at work flirt with me first. I really do get along with almost everyone and I think that people enjoy the happy vibes I bring to work. I worry that I May be the asshole because I give of douchey cocky vibes.

She says, something like, \"omg you basically see me as a pet dog\" or something like that. I replied, \"yup your basically a golden retriever.\" I proceeded to get ripped a new one by one of the older male hairstylist. He basically yelled at me saying im gonna get sued for sexual harrassment, and that calling someone a dog is implying something sexual, which made the situation super awkward because their was nothing sexual about it. Every client that was trying to enjoy their shampoo and scalp massage could hear him. My friend laughed that I got yelled at. She thought it was funny.Fast forward to today, I have somewhat repaired my relationship with the older male hairstylist, I dont hold grudges. I was talking with the same friend and she was talking why she doens't go to mexico to visit her grandfather. She mentioned it was too dangerous so I asked, \"where does he live in Mexico? Like what city?\" She said. \"He lives in a state.\" I said \"What do you mean? they have cities in Mexico. We are laughing and having a dumb conversation about the classifications of land in Mexico, when the same older male white hairstylists says \"what village does he live in?\". I replied to him in a sillly high pitched joking voice, \"Thats Racist!\" the implied point being that not everyone in mexico lives in a poor tiny village. I was obviously Joking. He then ripped me a new one, shouting that there are villages all over the world including the U.S. so its not racist. He then said very loudly \"Fuck you!, Seriously fuck you!\" . All the clients relaxing were interupted. I said, \"I wasnt actually calling you racist.\" He replied, \"It doenst matter you still said it.\" I personally feel he went way over the top and was incredibly unprofessional, especially at a salon of this caliber with clients paying the type of money they are. I also dont really know what set him off so I dont really know how to tiptoe around him. I feel like hes mad because I can joke and be myself and never get in trouble.

We don’t often get to have quality father-son talk. He doesn’t like to share too much about his private life. We were driving back home from the golf course when I asked him if he likes any women at his college. By his own admission, he only hooked up with one woman a few times. He admits to being really nervous around women. He’s a really shy guy overall. He said he wants a long-term girlfriend though.As a father, I told him my story of having many girlfriends by the time I was his age because I always put myself out there. I told my son that he has no reason to be nervous around woman because he is taller and more handsome than I ever was. I then asked him a few questions about what type of women he found attractive. I asked him what race he liked best and was willing to date. He said he liked Caucasians the most, Asians second, Hispanics third, and isn’t looking to date outside of those. Then I asked him about height. He said his favorite height in women is 5’7”. Then I asked him about weight and he said he likes women very thin, so he ballparked 100 lbs. I had to tell him that’s not a healthy weight for a woman that tall. He just shrugged. I asked him if he likes toothpick legs and he said he loves those. I said I liked thicker legs but he said he found those gross.Because of the ideal woman he so far has described, I then asked him if he likes small boobs. He said it doesn’t matter as long as they are fake. He said he likes them stay looking like grapefruits or oranges even when the women are lying on their back. He also said he hates the natural sag that real boobs have. He also said he isn’t willing to date women who stray much at all from his ideal standards. Now I pretty much know what type of women he’s going for. It clicked in my head why my son never had a girlfriend or more hook ups. His standards are way too high. I didn’t want to knock him down though because if that’s what makes him happy, then I’m all for it. My son is 6’1”, fit, handsome, and a charmer in my eyes, so it’s likely he will find that one if he puts himself out there. We also talked about what personality characteristics he found attractive so this talk wasn’t just about the superficial.Last night, I was talking to my wife about the type of women my son likes. She never asked him in that much detail. She doesn’t even know about his solo hookup. After hearing all of that, she asked me if I warned him that he’ll never get a girlfriend if he keeps up this impossible standard. I told her that if he only likes that type of women, then more power to him because I believe he will find her if he puts himself out there like I encouraged him to do.

However, after one or two days, my daughter started crying, telling me that she can't understand a thing. My nephew refuses to believe that. He is very strict about things, so I get that she is struggling, but she needs to try harder. However, she started crying and told me that she would stop studying if my nephew continues teaching her, which led to a huge argument between me and her. Now she refuses to visit me. She is saying that if I keep taking my nephew's side, she will stop visiting me at all. Am I the a**hole?",

	"body" : "Hey Reddit,I (M54) need some clarity on a situation ive ended up in. So, I've always been fascinated by ants, their organizational skills, and their unwavering determination, its some sort of weird fixation I have.So I recently declared myself the \"Emperor of the Ants\" and set up a tiny ant-sized palace made from LEGO blocks in my garden. I've been observing their daily activities, giving motivational speeches (in ant language, of course), and even appointed a royal court consisting of garden gnomes.So heres were it went wrong. My neighbor (F28) and her Husband (M65) frequently has picnics in their backyard, and their food attracts my ant subjects. I decided to implement an \"Ant Tax\" on their picnics. Whenever they have a picnic, I send my trusty garden gnome envoys to collect a small tribute of crumbs and a thimble-sized offering of soda.My neighbor, to say the least, is not thrilled. They've called me delusional and demanded I stop taxing their picnics. But I'm just trying to rule my ant kingdom efficiently. So, am I the asshole for declaring myself Emperor of the Ants and taxing my neighbor's picnics?UPDATE: I have found the wrong in my ways and have decided to obtain food for my colony in different ways. I will no longer steal from my neighbours and I will pay them back. Now I will use my own money to buy them food, such as honey or watermelon, and leave it out for them. I will stop treating them as slaves, and will provide for them whats necessary.",

	"body" : "Preface: he's trans. Still menstruates. Refuses to go on testosterone.Bf is smart, hardworking and very mature for his age. We get along very well. Part of the reason this rship works out so well is because he's independent and doesn't ask for much and that works out fine with me because I like my space.Except when he has periods. Dealing with them has been stressful. We live together since May (because of virus) and have dated since December. When he had periods, he wouldnt meet up with me and said he'd deal with it. I said ok. His period in March was ok, but he was in a lot of pain for whatever reason. In the days leading up to it, he was irritable then he was very whiny and clingy. Wanting to cuddle to sleep and rub against me and stuff. Nothing like the man I like. It was jarring. I cant deal with emotionally open people and part of his appeal is he ISNT emotionally open, so I wasnt sure why he was doing that. June, I got very busy with work and when he tried it again I straight up told him he didnt have the time to coddle him. He told me the reason he was clinging (in the SUMMER) was because he likes body heat from actual people. I wasnt comfortable with that so I got him those hot water packs. He said its not the same, but whatever. I was just busy, I wasn't being an asshole on purpose.Our relationship was very strained after and I wasnt sure why. In the lead up to his current period he was very irritable with me, and when he was whiny he would go talk to his friends rather than talking to me. Two days ago he got it and he didnt disturb me much thankfully. This is where the problem is: yesterday night he came to me WHILE I WAS WORKING in tears hunched over saying he was in too much pain and asked me to put him in my lap. Absolutely not. We dont do that regularly so I dont see why now. I was working, and he's bleeding so I thought it wasn't unreasonable to say no. We had a bit of an argument, and then he eventually just left the room. Next thing I know, he called HIS EX BF (who is still his friend?) and the ex bf took him to his own house. Obviously I am not comfortable with this. I called him a couple times but his ex bf just texted me to say I should reconsider before being such an asshole for no reason.This is unfair to me because our relationship isnt that emotionally open. We have boundaries, and he's not usually like this. Am I really such a dick for not wanting to deal with someone on their period who isnt rational and acts completely different to the bf I know?Edit: a lot of people are asking. I am 28 and he's 21. Also we have talked about me not being emotionally open. He knows this and has willingly entered a relationship with me. I'm not sure why he went and called his ex, presumably telling him how bad of a person I am over something HE ALREADY KNEW but there's that.",

	"body" : "We are a group of 5 friends(girls), we go to the same college and are all on campus residents. A few months ago, the 5 of us decided to have a party/stay over with a few other friends from college. We decided to book hotel rooms. Me and one other friend(Reva) were dating at the time and we said we needed separate rooms and would pay whatever it cost us while the others decided to stay in rooms that would occupy 4 people each to reduce costs, even though some of them were couples. However we only had a short time window and the hotel we were looking at became fully booked except for 3 rooms. But there were 12 of us and the only way we could stay there is if me, Reva and our boyfriends decided not to have private rooms. The only other hotel we could find for those particular dates and at affordable prices had a rule that would allow only 2 people in one room, but this would cost the others more than what they were originally planning.My friends(apart from Reva) decided it was unacceple for them to pay more because of our demand. They proposed the rest of them would only pay the price they intended to pay for the original hotel and we should bear the difference, or we should agree to huddle together with them, 4 people in a room. We felt this was unfair since they would also be getting extra facilities in the second hotel even if they staying there because of us and that we had the right to ask for private rooms. We had a huge heated argument over it in which one of the girls told us we could stay seperately if we wanted and they'll find someone else to stay with them, and we replied by saying they didn't want us only someone to pay the money. I even ended up crying in front of them but at the end we decided to not go to their party and stay seperately.We were still on okey terms after this but 2 days later the other three rounded up on lana, telling her how unfair we were being and basically pressuring her and not allowing her to speak up for herself. This fight was only between us but they decided to involve a third party, a classmate of ours, to mediate telling them a story completely different from what actually happened so the classmate also ended up siding with them. I was not around when this happened and only have second hand accounts of these events but when I heard about this I got really angry and I bad mouthed my friends to the said classmate, which on retrospect I shouldn't have done, it was a mistake on my part. Now it's possible that this third party informed my other friends of what I said, I don't really know since those 3 have stopped speaking to me and Reva since that day.Both of us felt like we had done nothing wrong and felt they were being childish so neither of us made any effort to resolve things either.

I found out  that I could likely resell my tickets for around $3,000. When I told my girlfriend this, she told me that I should be prioritizing her wants over money, and that it would be mean and unfair for me to sell them. To be clear she was not asking me to give her the tickets, only sell them to her for the original price. I told her that I would end up spending the money on her anyways and that it would end up being more value than one concert. She got very mad at me and has seemed distant for the past day or so.

Unfortunately, I recently quit my job and cannot afford to rent my current flat. Katia lives in a nice neighbourhood and owns her flat. It’s a two bedroom flat except she converted one bedroom into her office space. Except that she doesn’t need it. Katia is a writer. She writes romance novels and self publishes them. She’s one of the lucky ones who actually make quite a lot of money doing that. The thing is, she doesn’t need an office. She can write from anywhere, her living room, her bedroom, she sometimes writes in a library, coffee shop, the castle ruins (of the weather is nice), the beach. You get the point.As I’m not unemployed, I’ve thought about finally chasing my dream and starting streaming games. For that, I need a separate room to put my set up and record things. When I first talked to Katia about moving in, she was apprehensive but the more we talked, the more open she was to the idea. Last night, I mentioned that she’d have to get rid off her office. She asked why and I told her that she can write wherever she wants and I need a space to start my streaming career. She replied that it was not going to happen, we can make some space in the living room but she needs her office.I told her it’s just silly books, she can write them anywhere and I can’t bring my gaming set up to a cafe.She told me to not diminish her work and I said I wasn’t but it’s true, her job isn’t hat difficult and she can do it from the couch.She got really weird after. Tris morning when I was about to leave her house, she told me I had to look for my own flat because she didn’t want to move in together.I asked her if she was serious?

I saw her looking at Paul and Richard in a promiscuous way. I leaned over to tell her something along the lines of \"Stop looking at Richard like that he has a girlfriend, and Paul is only your friend they don't want to hook up\". I said this hoping that she would stop and not try anything as I feel like it would hurt the friend group dynamic. Shortly after Paul came over and walked her to another conversation away from me.After even more drinks I was joking around with Richard and told him Mary kept looking at him in an interesting way, I told him if he isn't happy in his relationship he should go for Mary. I was testing his loyalty in his current relationship to see how he would react. Once again he brushed me off and walked away.

It’s not that I’m homophobic, I’m simply trying to please all of our relatives to not cause any drama at my baby’s first birthday.My brother told me that if his husband wasn’t invited, he wouldn’t attend either which I found a little ridiculous. You’d expect a grown man to be able to spend an afternoon without his husband.I told him to stop being so damn clingy and grow up, and he had the audacity to chuckle before hanging up on me.I haven’t heard from him since. My parents and grandparents are supportive of my decision to avoid trouble by not inviting my BIL, but my sister has accused me of catering to our relatives’ homophobic ideals (which is pretty ridiculous if you ask me).",

	"body" : "My wife is 48, we have been married for nearly 20 years. We have a 18 year old son, as well as 4 younger kids.Our son is in his last year of high school. He is a very popular guy and has many friends. His friends often come over to hang out and occasionally to sleep over. Our house is large so they like coming here.Last year, my son’s best friend Tom (also 18) came with us on a family vacation at our beach house. During that time I noticed that he would always be staring at my wife and checking her out. Once, he walked in on her changing in a bathroom, and claimed that he “didnt know it was occupied”. He would also say borderline inappropriate comments like “you look lovely today” and “you have to tell me your workout routine”. For this reason I am a bit wary of Tom, in particular.On Saturday, my son and his 4 friends,including Tom, were over at our house for a sleepover. In the morning, my wife made them breakfast. She was wearing only a silk camisole and shorts. I walked in and noticed that many of the guys were not so subtly “checking her out”. Don’t get me wrong, my wife looks amazing for her age, but it just seemed uncomfortable and awkward for her to be dressed like that in front of her son’s friends.After breakfast, I mentioned this to her, and told her that she should consider wearing something less revealing next time, or simply just get dressed in her everyday clothes. She said its “no big deal” and that I’m being too overbearing, that “they’re just kids”. I said they’re not just kids, they’re young men, and I’m just looking out for her. Besides, I told her that our son would no doubt agree with me, that he’d prefer it if his friends didn’t check out his mother.Am I the asshole here?",

I want to ask her to pay the total amount for what the remote actually cost, but I’m afraid she might not think that’s fair (and honestly, I have my doubts as well).This is similar to a discussion we had a time ago, where she caused the window of my car to be broken. I submitted a claim to my insurance company, and they replaced it, and I just paid my deductible (a small fraction of what it would have cost). However, I told her that I believed she had to reimburse the total amount for the window replacement because the insurance (or warranty in the case of the Apple TV) was something I paid myself.If the broken window or the remote costs less or is free, it is because of the charges I assumed when getting the insurance or warranty.Edit: thanks all for your comments and opinions, some of you offered great advises.

My son asked his co worker for a favor, something about loading a copy machine into a truck or putting away the lift gate, but his co worker according to my son asked him \"Are you seriously asking me for help right now\"? My advice to him over the phone was to not ask people for things, ever. Regardless of how my son's co worker reacted, I felt as though it was my son's responsibility to not put himself in positions like this where people can get angry with him.Boy did my son explode on me. Where I felt that perhaps my son was going to be open minded to what I had to say, he became rather aggravated and sarcastically said to me “Yeah you’re right dad, I’ll never ask anyone for a single thing again, thank you, you’re so helpful”.This isn’t the first time however, I’ve never gotten along with my son, he’s autistic and we’ve always butted heads. Over the phone he stated that none of his past frustrations with me or my wife have ever been addressed, and he claims that I have never stood up for him, and that I’ve never met his emotional needs as a child. This isn’t how I wanted my night to go and just wished things were peaceful. I wish he would just listen to my advice without being so reactive, and I finally admitted to him that I could never see him being the victim of anything, he’s vicious, he’s not nice to me, or his mother.This went down an even larger rabbit hole where he accused me of gaslighting him, and made claims about me always abusing my position of position of power, but my interpretation is that he always wanted to control everything. He’s always wanted to control how I speak to him, the words I use, the tone I use, I’ve always felt as though I walked on eggshells around him. I feel as though he blames me for everything wrong in his life without taking any real responsibility for his actions.I thought after the phone call, things may have calmed down, and that perhaps my son and I could just move on from the past. I received a certified letter from him that I had to pick up from the post office. He had stated that he wanted nothing to do with me ever again, he restated many of the same points he made over the phone.I’m getting older and I don’t regret having children, and I don’t want to loose my oldest child. I wish my son was grateful for the gift of being alive and I wished he would look at the positive aspects of life for once.

The youngest is with my husband, 40m, the oldest is with my ex from when I was 18 and my daughter is with Lance, a man I should never have been with but an so glad I was because I have her. He was abusive and narcissistic. My husband views her as his, and she's his princess. She's met Lance once and didn't like him. I moved out of state last year, and my son stayed behind.Today was supposed to be a great day. We had extra chores to do before going to see the Mario movie since both the younger two were supposed to go with friends weeks ago, and that didn't pan out. We were halfway through our work when I decided it was lunchtime. My husband wanted to go out. My younger two spent the car ride arguing over the gift they convinced their brother to get me for Mother's Day, and I told them no to calling him, which resulted in pouting. I didn't want them to call him because I know he works Saturdays, and I figured I could text him later. So they moved on to competing for whose phone could make the most noise with YouTube, TikTok qetc. By the time we got to the restaurant, I was at my wit's end. Then my son texted and mentioned that somebody t-boned his car in the parking lot overnight so he wasn't going to work. My kids asked if they could call him since he wasn't at work. I said no since he's dealing with his vehicle. He didn't need the stress of his siblings vying for his attention. More pouting. Whatever. Then my youngest started singing a song from the movie and my daughter told him to save it for the movie and he told her he likes the song and he kept singing. In fairness, I missed this exchange because I was texting my oldest. What I did catch was my youngest screaming at his sister, not to mess with his food. So my head snapped up, and I whisper yelled \"stop, or the day is over.\" I asked what the scream was for. She'd put gravy on his fries. I asked her why. She said she was playing. I asked how it's playing to mess with his food? She didn't answer. I asked if she thought it was funny. No answer. I told her that's something Lance would always do, mess with people to upset them on purpose, and call it a game. My husband had already looked irritated when I started in on her and cut me off when I said that. We paid and left, and in the car, I accused him of being mad that I reprimanded his princess. He asked why I always claim that, and I said he always defends her no matter what. He said I need to stop comparing her to Lance, but this is the first time I've ever said something like that, although it's not the first time I thought it. He then told me that our son started it with the Princess Peach song again. I replied that my son needed to stop too but that the being annoying and messing with food are not the same.So, AITA for saying what I thought of my daughter's actions?ETA: I love my daughter. Nobody who knows me in person thinks I'm abusive. Actually, most who know me in personi aspire to be a mom like me in most ways, though I'm not perfect as evidenced here. I don't ever start off by yelling at her except to get her attention. I talk to her because I want answers. This was a discussion I was trying to have with her, not a screaming fest. I was calmly asking her why because I wanted to know what she was thinking. It's easier to address the behavior if you know the reason behind the behavior. I use the same discussion method on all my kids. When my oldest was a teen, he wouldn't respond, but he also wouldn't give me a dead stare. He'd look down like he was uncomfortable, but his ear would be tilted toward me. He'd slightly shake his head if I asked if he thought his behavior was OK. He'd give me some response to know he was listening. My youngest actually responds to everything. But I think my oldest's response is more typical. Even though she doesn't respond at all to me or anybody else, whether the behavior is addressed in the moment or after the fact, it still has to be addressed.You can say I was TA in this moment, which I accept, but don't act like you know our entire lives. I love my daughter, I've been accused of favoritism toward her and I've been accused of favoritism towards my others and I try to be conscious of both but really, I think they're different kids and in different situations need different types of attention. Everybody seems to think I ignored my son's behavior. I didn't mention it originally because the post was about the interaction with my daughter, but I did address his annoyance once I realized it. I told him that he needed to find something else to focus on that wouldn't annoy his sister or he would miss the movie and stay home with his cousins who had opted not to go. This was 3 hrs before the movie. We did all see the movie, and my daughter got extra candy for being the most helpful and cooperative and even doing some of her brother's room, so I'm guess she's my favorite, right?",

He isn't honoring her memory by deciding to to be single, and TBH it's a bit in*elly to not have any interest in dating for a reason like that.I also told him she'd probably be disappointed in him to see he hasn't moved on yet, and he lost it.

I don't mean many dandelions, I mean so many yellow flowers and white dandelion puffs that you can barely see the ground underneath- literally covered in dandelions.  I'm an avid gardener who enjoys gardening and planting over the summer, and as you can imagine, this has been a nightmare for me. It's hard enough to stay on top of dandelions when your neighbor isn't waging biological warfare on you with thousands of little dandelion seeds landing in your lawn constantly. On top of all of that, I'm somewhat allergic, and I can barely step out my front door anymore without my nose dripping a waterfall of snot, stuffy nose and my eyes watering.I tried to use dandelion sprays on my lawns and just pulling them out when I see them- it barely worked.I tried talking to my neighbor and asking them to maybe take care of their garden a little bit- I even offered to do it for them, free of charge. They declined.I tried reporting the issue, but nothing came of it- I guess weed control laws aren't heavily enforced.At this point, I feel like pulling out all the dandelions myself, or at least spraying some sort of killer on their lawn to see if it helps, because I can't deal with this anymore.WIBTA?",

My wife is a pediatric nurse on a cancer ward, and works every other year and it’s 12 hour shifts, so even if she does stop by, it’s somewhat late. This year it’s her year to work. My dad mentioned to me over the weekend that they found it disrespectful that she only came every other year. I reminded him she was a nurse, but he said she knew how important Thanksgiving was to our family and how she should work something out because our traditions are her traditions now. I agreed with that.I mentioned trying to get every Thanksgiving off to my wife and she said it didn’t work that way schedule wise, and that even if she could get this year off, that would mean she’d have to give up Christmas and that’s the holiday that’s a big deal in her family. I told her that since she married me my families traditions should be more important to her. She got pretty aggravated at that, and walked away from me.I called to tell my parents and my mom flipped out. Apparently, only my dad thinks that and my mom thinks I should go grovel for forgiveness for suggesting “such stupidity”. The thing is, I do kinda agree with my dad.

Usually we have me and 2 other people closing up. The duties for the closing shift are all things that drive me insane such as vacuuming, sweeping, cleaning the glass cases and mopping. My sensory issues cause me to not do these duties and I just stick to filling the bags.Last night we were busy and had to start on our duties later than usual and this meant we had to stay longer in the store. My coworker \"Tonya\" (26F) was visually upset and I asked her what was wrong? She said it wasn't fair I only did one thing every night and that we all had sensory issues we put aside to help out and I should push past them too so we could all go home quicker. This upset me because no one ever takes my autism seriously and in the moment I called her an ableist jerk who has no right in making any requests for me to do anything. She froze and when I walked away, my coworker said she was quietly crying to herself while mopping.Did I cross the line or was I right to defend myself? AITA?Edit to add some info: I never told my bosses or anything about my sensory issues bc I thought it would mean I wouldn't get the job.I work closing because it's the shift with the least amount of customers and I don't have to be out on the floor as much and I can do my daily routine before work.We get a sheet that we assign ourselves closing tasks to at the end of the night so we can split them and they always ask what is up to doing and I always say bags and ask if they would be fine with handling everything else BUT they always say it's fine.Also my mom cleans my room/apartment because she knows how hard these tasks are for me.",

Wider and longer as her pregnancy progressed.It has been a big mood killer for me and it’s made worse by the fact that my mom compares pregnancy feet to a loaf of bread and I can only visualize her feet like that.But more than that, my mom said that feet are supposed to shrink after pregnancy and that weight loss is a big part of it.So I was upset that my wife just spent all this money on new shoes when she barely goes anywhere outside of either her bedroom or our baby’s room, and should be gunning for weight loss instead of throwing in the towel.I thought that it was an impulsive purchase that in the end was going to waste money and disincentivize her to lose weight and look for solutions to her swollen feet.As a result, I ended up taking the shoes back and getting refunds.Now my wife is pissed and I feel like she’s just going to refuse to lose weight out of spite.AITA?

At first, I was excited to visit such a far-flung, non-westernized place. However, over the past 3 months, the novelty has largely worn off, and I have more negative things to say than positive things. Namely, it takes forever to get the simplest bureaucratic things done here; the drivers are crazy, at least in the area I live in; food preparation is questionable, and I have gotten enough food poisoning for a lifetime. There are other issues that I have with this city too.However, I do enjoy the company of the locals, and I have made a few friends here.

I had a mostly great time at Jack's place, and I met his wife and son as well. It was mostly good, however, up until we started talking about my home (I live in Arizona). I admitted to Jack and his family that I was a little bit homesick, and then, in a little slip-up, I told them: \"as much as I appreciate the experience of living in Mombasa, I'm looking forward to going back to a more civilized place\".Jack and his family all just looked disappointed when they heard what I said. He went on this semi-long rant about how, despite all of Kenya's problems, he doesn't like the portrayal of Africans in general as \"uncivilized\" people. He told me that I must not see the beauty in Kenya, and he walked me to the door and told me \"good night\".

I'm not trying to criticize his socializing skills or anything, just giving some background about our personalities.Anyways, over the past couple years I've been steadily growing an Instagram presence and have become a bit of an \"influencer\" if you will. I get invited to fancy parties sometimes because of this and this has started some conflict between me and my bf.I of course want my bf to come with me to these parties, but here's the problem. He's not the most fashion forward, and he'll show up to parties wearing something basic like jeans and a button-up shirt. My followers all know me for my sense of style and the influencer circles I run in are also fashion-related, so it's a bit embarrassing for both him and me when he comes to parties dressed like that. I've seen my friends and peers side-eyeing him and it's honestly just so mortifying.This all came to a head last night when one of my influencer guy friends, I'll call him Jason, made a comment about my bf's clothing at a party we were at. He wasn't super mean or anything, just noted how my bf looks out of place and teased a little bit about how he even got an invite. For comparison, Jason always dresses super nicely and always looks very sharp. I just kind of laughed and joked about how he must've just wandered in, and I admittedly did kind of avoid my bf for the rest of the night.This morning, I got a text from my bf asking me if everything was okay cuz I was kind of distant last night. I didn't even really know what to say at first, but finally just decided to tell him straight up that he needs to start dressing more appropriately for these parties or else I won't invite him to them anymore. He hasn't responded since.AITA for that comment? I can see how it could be misunderstood or misconstrued to be kind of rude, but I just want to look out for him so he doesn't embarrass himself in front of my friends.",

So that the cats can have the option to roam or have their own isolated space, R has a pet door in her bedroom doorway with a small gate for the cats to go through. A few days ago R was going into her room and bumped my dog’s head with the gate. It wasn’t a hard bump and not hard enough to seriously injure her, but R did not react to it in any way whatsoever, not even a glance to see if my dog was ok. I calmly commented to R that she bumped my dog’s head, and her response was a very sarcastic ‘sorry.’ At that I was fuming, but I tried not to explode. I took my dog on her morning walk so I could have time to cool down. After we got back I said as calmly as I could to R that her response was not acceptable. Her response was getting up, walking over, and closing her door in my face. She has a disorder that causes periods of irritability, so I tried to chalk it up to that and figured that after it passed she would apologize. This morning R still hadn’t said anything, so I brought it up again and she snapped and yelled at me saying that I was somehow ‘projecting’ my being offended onto my dog, and she thinks she doesn’t have to apologize for the bump or how she shut her door in my face because she didn’t actually injure my dog. Now I don’t want to have anything to do with her and told her that she is not to go anywhere near my dog, I’m never leaving my dog alone with her again, and I plan to move out as soon as possible. So, the question is, am I the asshole for overreacting, or is she the asshole for being disrespectful to both me and my dog?Edit for context: I am on the Autism Spectrum and my dog is my service dog for it. R obviously knows this and is well aware that I feel very protective of her. Being on the spectrum, certain things bother me to a degree that they wouldn’t bother other people. I never let it out though, I keep it contained and do not ever snap or explode. I constantly filter my words and actions and have done so for so many years that it’s automatic and it’s incredibly stressful, which is why I have a service dog. R is well aware of all this. To be clear I also maintained a calm demeanor throughout this whole thing. I didn’t yell at her, I didn’t rant at her, I tried to express to her that there was an issue. She responded with a lack of concern in the moment when it happened, she shut her door in my face which is a bit childish to do instead of just trying to sort it out, and after it being brought up again multiple days later when the occurrence was no longer immediate, she responded by yellingEdit for character content: I am not trying to villainize R, she’s a good person.

We planned to raise our future kids as “cousins.” We both started trying for a family earlier this year, she got pregnant quickly and my husband and I have struggled. I was ecstatic for her she even told me the news before she told her husband. I had a lot of stressful things happen in my life in addition to the fertility stuff like a layoff and health scare. She was as supportive as she could be but it wasn’t the same as before. She even had to cancel coming to a very important event that I held because of her pregnancy. I understand why she couldn’t come but it sucked she wasn’t there. Before her son was born I offered to visit anytime she needed me so I could help with her or the baby or any other things she may need, but I felt like the offer was pushed off because anytime I mentioned it, she would say something like “I’ll have to see how (husband) and I are feeling”Beth gave birth a few weeks ago and I was shocked at how little I seemed to matter to her immediately. I thought that if I wasn’t there to meet him in person, we’d FaceTime soon afterwards but I seemed to fall to the bottom of the pile. She went from telling me everything to not introducing me to her baby for almost a day after he was born. (She sent me pictures and a quick note right away but said she wanted to introduce his name to me with a picture of him with a sign she had made, and didn’t do that until they went home the next day) We didn’t FaceTime for days afterwards and even then it was hurried. I offered again to come visit as soon as she said the word. She said she was super overwhelmed and couldn’t handle any more visitors. I get being overwhelmed but we would be there to be helpful and take care of her not stress her out. Then something happened to me which really shook me up, I reached out to Beth because I really needed her and she ignored my message. I’m not the best at asking for help so I was a little vague but she has always picked up on things like this before. When I asked her about ignoring my message she said it was because her son had a scare and went to the ER, which I feel for her, but she never followed up on my message (Her son was fine btw) The final straw came when she posted pictures with the caption “(son) meeting all of his aunts and uncles!” - I thought i was considered an Aunt too?I finally confronted her about how everything had made me feel. She apologized but followed those with excuses, saying how difficult things had been for her, and how her priority is now her son. I get things have been stressful but I’ve been there for her and have offered to do anything to help. It ultimately ended with us deciding to take a break, but I don’t see how this can be resolved unless she takes ownership of how her actions made me feel and do better in the future.",

	"body" : "Hey everyone. Huge family fight just took place because I sounded my opinion on not wanting to partake in this inconvenient selfish destination wedding.We’re from the NE USA. The wedding is in Italy. About a 14 hour flight one way. I have absolutely 0 interest in partaking in this wedding. I’m sorry, I love my sister, but this is a huge ask. I just started a business, and have been working 60-70 hour weeks. To take an entire week off is just not in the cards at this time. The wedding is in June.My mother asked me “when are you placing your order for plane tickets for the wedding?” To which I replied “I’m not placing tickets because I’m not going.”Now, I live with my parents because, as a 23 year old with past alcohol addiction, I figured nothing could keep me as honest as living with my parents again. (18-22 lived on my own and supported myself.)It’s helped tremendously stay away from drinking. Quite honestly, I don’t have the financial means to move out because of the medical expenses that incurred due to rehab. And they know this, so they threw out the offer of covering all expenses. I still declined.The threat came… “either you come to the wedding or im no longer supporting you.” Keep in mind — they offered to pay for my flights and everything else. I truly have no interest in going to a wedding 1… but 2, one thousands of miles away. I’m happy where i am, I have no desire to visit any other countries (I know, uncultured… just doesn’t interest me)It gets more complicated. I had a really bad breakup that led to my drinking issue in the first place. I know it’s selfish on my part, but I have a really hard time witnessing true intimacy. And to ask me to travel for an entire week to watch that? I don’t know that would be conducive to my mental state.I have 0 interest in this wedding, and if it was stateside, or even perhaps within a 3 hour plane ride I’d be more inclined to attend.I’m not trying to justify looking like the asshole, I just need to know if I am being one.Tl;dr: don’t want to attend sisters destination wedding, I think she’s being selfish, but because I have no interest in attending, my mom thinks I’m TA.",

	"title" : "AITA For asking someone to not tell young and impressionable women that being a mom was her greatest achievement?",
	"body" : "I (38F) work at a university where part of my job is recruiting/hosting speakers for events in the C&E (construction and engineering) department. We were hosting a panel of 3 women engineers that for a discussion geared more specifically to the female students on being a woman in the workplace, facing discrimination, etc. We had briefed them about intros, discussion questions, that they'd be taking questions from the crowd, etc but we don't tell them what to say except to keep it PG-13.The issue for me was that one of the engineers (40ish F?) gave her intro, her job, certifications, big projects she worked on but then ended it with \"and my greatest achievement is being a mom to my 3 kids\". That last part really rubbed me the wrong way. These were young women who really don't need to be told to have kids right now. I felt like it reinforced the stereotype that women existed to make babies. It frankly felt like she was abusing her power as a panelist to encourage girls to go get pregnant. Why did she even have to mention it on a panel about her career? It felt like she had to mention it because that's what a good ol woman does.After the panel was over, I pulled her aside and politely suggested to her that she not mention her kids if she's going to be on future panels, especially if it's to young and impressionable women because it takes away from her career achievements and makes it seem like women just exist to have kids (I said it more politely than that). She asked if I had kids. I said no (cf by choice). And she made a really bitchy comment along the lines of \"why are you telling me what my accomplishments should be then\". I, still trying to be polite, told her that the panel should be about her career. We went back and forth for a bit. At one point I did make an inappropriate comment that we are trying to create engineers, not Handmaidens.I'm pretty sure she complained to someone, because I have a meeting with HR and my direct supervisor that just got sent to me. No context. I know I made an inappropriate comment that I will own, but I feel like everything else I said was valid.

There’s constant jumping, stomping, and running. While I 100% don’t blame the kid for just being a kid, I’m pissed off that his mom knowingly chose to live on the highest floor above people. I just feel like there HAD to have been a floor unit available she could have chose. The complex is long and not tall. There’s only 3 floors total with more of a vertical stretching design so I think it was definitely do-able. It’s multiple 3 floor buildings chained together so it’s not a tower environment. My fiancée is a lot more forgiving and she always says that he’s just a kid she can’t control him. To a certain extent I don’t disagree but I just feel like it’s a courtesy thing to:Keep your kid from running around after 9pm and before 10am OrOr just be conscious of others and choose a ground unitOne time they woke me up with huge thumping and thuds, maybe jumping too? Not sure. But it was 5AM so I was really upset. I usually restrain myself from doing this any other time, but I grabbed a broom and banged on the ceiling. Throughout the day if it gets too excessive I’ll blast my anime or music from my tv or speakers at max volume to drown the kid out. I don’t do it the moment I hear something because I understand to a certain extent, but when it gets overly excessive that’s when I’ll do it. Am I in the wrong here? I just think the mom lacked empathy when she chose to live on the 3rd floor with a rambunctious child. I want to workout at home more instead of paying for a gym but I’m waiting until I move into a house soon so I’m not jumping and slamming over someone’s head. And even if she’s been there for years before she had the kid, she could have renewed her lease in a ground unit instead. I’ve been here for the past year and a half so I don’t know how long she’s been here. From august of 2022 to august of 2023 it wasn’t that bad. But she’s been in her apartment more with the child ever since September.TL;DR: Loud toddler upstairs throughout all times of the day, not mad at the kid but I’m irritated with the mom who chose to live/continues to live above people knowing how much noise it’s causing. I blast music and loud stuff when it gets overly excessive. Curious if I’m in the wrong.",

I get scared and tell N I don’t really love her, I wouldn’t have anything to do with the baby, that I wanted to get back with my wife, suggest N get an abortion.

I had recently become vegan over a month ago, and I take it fairly seriously (although I don't force it on other people at all or judge for their particular choices in food). Carl would say I'm one of his best friends, so I didn't think there would be any harm in asking.\"Will there be any vegan options at the reveal?\"\"Now that was a stupid question and you know it.\"It was a weirdly vitriolic response to a simple question. I would have dropped it if it was a simple \"no, sorry\", but I pushed the conversation further. He told me I should know better considering how he eats and how his girl eats and how her family is (despite never meeting her or being told much about her). He also said I should cook and bring my own food for this party. I wouldn't have the biggest issue with this either, but the hostility and dismissiveness at my question made it hard to blindly go along with it.The conversation turned into a one-sided argument with him getting more annoyed and dismissive. He started putting words in my mouth and saying things like \"I'm not ordering a buffet just for you\", \"You're overreacting\", \"I'm not going to let you make demands to me\" and the like. I was nervously laughing/joking about the situation since I think it was absurd that a small question caused the conversation to escalate so much. Jamie would chip in and ask why was it so hard to get a vegan burger for a few bucks, which would annoy Carl further, causing him to explain how much this party costs and how he's not in charge of food and how I should take it up with his girl (who I don't even know).Eventually Carl told me and Jamie he didn't want to discuss it further, leading to one awkward as fuck ride back. Nobody said anything for the rest of the car ride. I was upset since I don't think I did anything wrong, yet just that question spawned the most uncomfortable conversation I've had with Carl, all over food. So, I was dropped off, said very little to Carl still feeling upset and all, and haven't spoken to him since.Additional info: Carl would be my ride to/from this party since I don't have a car. He lives out of town so leaving the party and walking home isn't doable. He also implied he expected me to help clean up after the party (this has happened before).

I find it difficult to ignore junk food laying around the house so my solution is to never buy them. On the other hand, my partner is going through a stressful job search and has been eating a lot of junk food to cope.Although we are both young and otherwise healthy individuals, I see this as a problem, both for me and for them. This makes my life difficult when it comes to avoiding unhealthy food, and I see their unhealthy lifestyle (junk food is apart of it) creating mood/mental problems for them. Accordingly, my partner agrees but don't view it with the same priority or impact, and therefore don't care much about addressing it right now.Over the past 6 months or so, I've gradually brought up this topic and tried and get them to be healthier, or at least stop eating junk food. This started off as something like \"hey let's put some of these junk food back on the shelf\" while at the grocery store, to \"I don't want any of that, make sure you'll eat all of it if you're going to buy it.\" My partner's reaction to it every time has been either neutral or of implicit agreement. To be fair, none of these conversation was a \"sit-down\" conversation. They were all casually discussed but never met with any resistance.Objectively speaking, I'm a health nazi. I measure and eat the exact same thing everyday, go to bed early, take a bunch of supplements/nootropics. My partner is the exact opposite, their diet isn't \"bad\" in the traditional high-calorie/processed-food type of way but is malnourished. They will sometimes over consume until their stomach hurts, or eat nothing but ramen. In terms of junk food, they eat about 2 bags a week.Few weeks ago I took it a bit further and told my partner that I will throw out any junk food I find in the house and that they can either hide it or stop buying them. They agreed at the time (although they later said it was out of curtsey). Leading up to the event, I found some of their junk food in a drawer and even reminded them to put it away.Today, I found another bag of chips in the pantry, I threw it out and then told them about it -- they immediately went into a rage, slammed a water bottle to the floor, kicked the trash can, physically blocked my path, and demanded I never throw out any of their stuff again unless I want a divorce.I took this as a threat and became angry as well. I escalated the situation by calling it a bluff. My partner handed me another bag of chips and dared me to throw it away and I did, so here we are.[See my comment below]",

Obviously, Covies hit everyone hard. A lot of tenants were unable to pay so I worked with them to create payment plans, in many cases reduced rent and for some long time tenants even completely forgave months of unpaid rent. My tenants are fantastic and all of them would call and explain why they would be short, were profusely apologetic, etc. I'm sure some of them were BS-ing a bit but everyone got hit to a degree and I was feeling generous and helped everyone I could (I own enough RE that Covid barely scratched me financially).Except for one tenant. She called and left a message saying \"I cannot pay this month.\" Thats it. No apologies. Whatever I was going to let it slide temporarily. But she ended up not paying rent for 15 months and the few times I was able to contact her she just said \"this is how it is\" or something similar. Eventually she blocked my office number and my cell number so I had to use VOIP to reach her. She was the only tenant who did this, banking on the fact that courts were closed and I guess she figured out I wouldn't do anything about it.Well finally the courts opened. I pushed through the eviction and got her out. The damage to the apartment was way more that normal wear and tear for 4 years and there was clear intentional damage so I only returned roughly $290 of her $1250 security. She still owed roughly $18,750 in rent not to mention unpaid pet fees and late fees.  Its not about the money. Its about disrespect. So I went through the courts to have her car seized and sold. She now only owes me roughly $4,000. However she has blown up my phone about how terrible I am for doing this to her and making her take the bus to work.Again, it's not about the money.

After me and ex broke up me and Alex remained friends. We hang out a lot when they are not at uni/work. Even if we are in the same city we still live far from each other (around 2hours of public transport) which is not really an issue with me because i usually sleep at their place. A few months ago Alex met ‘Kyle’ (20M) on tinder and they have since been fuck buddies. Kyle is.. a massive asshole. He clearly has a lot of internalized homophobia (he’s bi but not out) and has sometimes said a bunch of transphobic crap. I didn’t really mind him much until recently. During the holidays Alex went back to his homecity to be with their parents who do not support them being trans and their desire to start transitioning, that triggered a depressive episode. Kyle texted me (we had only talked a few times) asking me for tips on how to cheer Alex up. I gave him the very basic talk you give to cis people about trans issues, and to be there for Alex.. and Kyle accused me of treating him like a child. To which i replied that then i didn’t really know what he expected me to say to him. He accused me of only caring about them as a trans person and not as a friend. And so i told me that maybe he wasn’t really taking seriously what effects transphobia has to a trans person. After that i stopped answering. I sent Alex some screens of the convo. So now Kyle now hates me and thinks i’m not a good friend to Alex.When Alex went to their homecity they told me they were gonna come back after New Year so they could spend it with family. So i prepared myself to spending New Year alone (i don’t really have many friends), i really didn’t mind. But on Christmas Alex texted me that they were gonna come back the following day. And i was so happy because that would have meant we got to spend New Year together. Then Kyle started asking Alex if we could go to one of his friend’s places, and i didn’t want to. Alex told him no. Kyle then asked if he and his friend (who we don’t know btw) could come over to Alex’s then. Alex didn’t wanna fight with him so they said yes. And so i told them i wasn’t gonna come if Kyle was there. And Alex apologized to me and promised to make it up to me.. but i’m honestly so sad and disappointed. Now i have to get over being alone on New Year’s all over again. After they made me believe we were gonna spend it together. I think i might be the asshole because when they apologized to me i basically told them they were being a bad friend. i told them that their actions are telling me that they’d rather not see me than say no to Kyle.i don’t know what to do, AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for refusing to attend my best friend's baby shower after she disregarded my advice?",
	"body" : "I've been close with my (F28) friend (F23), I'll call her Kacy, for over five years now. She's generally super chill and we pretty much never argue or fight, unless it's about small stuff. After she told me she was pregnant, I was so excited. I've never had a friend be pregnant before - I have friends, but most are younger than me lol. So of course I wanted to help out in any way I could, and when she specifically asked for my advice on the baby names she chose, I was happy to help.Kacy showed me this pretty long list of boy names, like 15-20 names, and a few were bolded. She told me that the bolded ones were the ones she was most comfortable using. Most of these bolded names with the most unhinged, abstract names I'd ever seen, names like Fintan, Goban, Liamy, etc. I don't know if it's her culture or something but obviously I had to tell her that she couldn't give her child a name like that unless she wanted him to suffer in life. She said she didn't realize that it could actually create issues but she seemed pissed, and at the time I didn't really care, we didn't speak for a few days but I started to get annoyed that she didn't respond to me just trying to ask her what's going on in her life.The final straw, though, was when she invited me to her BABY SHOWER and I realized she gave her son the name Liamy - one of the names I explicitly said was not fine for her to use. I don't understand how she could expect me to just suddenly forgive her and forget what happened. Of course, she still hasn't responded to any of my texts (I must've sent at least 10 by now) or returned my calls. The shower's in three days and I just want some confirmation that I'm in the right, please.",

	"body" : "Let’s call my roommate Carly and my former roommate (who Carly replaced) Kayla. I stated in my post that I was looking for a family unit, like a family-like environment.I met Carly over the summer on Facebook and we got along right from the start and shared similar views on a lot of things. We FaceTimed, hung out in person a few times and she even housesat for me for a few hours once. She was also often sending me roomie night tik toks for stuff we could do when she moved in. She moved in officially 2 months later.So about two weeks after she moved in, I decided to have a check in with her. Throughout that time I noticed she seemed depressed and stayed in her room a lot and seemed tired a lot. She had briefly explained to me that she moved out of her mom’s due to toxic family, which I understand since that was also why I moved out of state. But she said some stuff like how her grandpa chased her around the house which made me realize she had it way worse than me. Of course, I didn’t pressure her into saying more since she clearly didn’t want to.But my thing is, it feels like she’s a completely different person from how she presented herself over the summer. She was very bubbly and I thought we were gonna have a lot of fun roommate nights together.When I was living with Kayla (former roomie), it felt like a family unit even though she was home maybe once a week. I also noticed Carly had a lot more food in the fridge than Kayla did.I never had to close my door when Kayla was here but I feel like I have to with Carly. I told her this and that I feel like I’m just coexisting when I asked for a family unit and that I have cocoon myself. I even asked my friend who is a therapist how I can help Carly and she said just to give her time. I said all this to Carly, I was nice about it of course but she got upset and said she did need time and that she didn’t think the move out would have such a toll on her.AITA? I feel like I made valid points. I brought up Kayla too and I’m starting to wonder if Carly felt like she was being compared.",

	"body" : "To clarify, the wedding hasn't happened yet. I am non-binary. I was asked to be a bridesmaid for a friend of mine a little less than a year ago and now the wedding is in a few weeks. Right off the bat, I asked her if I could wear a suit. Her brother is the \"maid\" of honor so I figured it wouldn't be a big deal. Dresses make me incredibly uncomfortable and I didn't want to spend that kind of money on something I'd likely hate. I don't make much.She told me no. She was worried about symmetry even though we'd already have one suit wearer on the bride's side. I don't wear dresses. I have a little bit of trauma related to them but the bigger problem is the dysphoria and how much they destroy my self-esteem. I have never looked good in them, even when I presented as cis-gendered. I offered to cover my tattoos, including an unfinished sleeve and completed half sleeve, and to take out my gauges and various other piercings and she said no to all that. But I can't wear pants.Some of my newer friends think it's selfish that she's prioritizing some pictures that will rarely be looked at over our years of friendship and my gender identity. Another friend said I was being taken advantage of.I tend to believe that relationships, including friendships, take sacrifice sometimes, and I gave up the fight on the dress because the wedding isn't about me, but some people have told me I should have more respect for myself and stand my ground. I've already bought what I'm wearing and it's fitted so it's happening, and that's not changing, but it has left me curious.Am I the asshole for insisting that I be allowed to wear pants?Edit: I'm not insisting on wearing pants anymore, this is a post-discussion question. A reflection I guess. I'm wearing what the bride wants, I just hate it. Years ago, said bride told me I could wear pants in her future wedding, I asked fairly soon after agreeing to be in the party if I could wear a suit or pants or something and I didnt really get a committed response until we were actively shopping for the dresses and by then I felt too bad to back down from the party.",

My husband has several friends since his childhood, I know them all and they are good guys. They often make plans on Fridays or Saturdays to go out, take some beers and chat, I had joined him a few times but it's just not my vibe, I don't drink and even thought I get along with them, I don't know, sometimes I just don't feel like going or I am working late and feel very tired on a Friday night. When that had happened I had told him to go himself since I don't want him to stop hanging out with them just because I can't/don't want to go, which I am cool with it but he comes back come very late, around 1pm, maybe this is not considered late for some of you but he leaves around 6pm and I just wish he could come a bit earlier to expend time with me since I cannot sleep until he comes back. Last night he went out, he asked me to go but I was still working, it was one of those hectic days at work and still needed to wrap up a lot of things, I haven't even had the time to take a shower during the day and I was a total mess (I work from home but my work is very demanding) I told him that it was okay for him to to on his own since I was still not done with work and I wasn't ready to go plus I catched a cold and wasn't feeling well. He asked me \"are you sure? Because then you get upset\" but I told him that I don't get upset as long as he doesn't come home at 1am and he told me he won't. Around 12:50am I texted him if he would come home soon (he hadn't texted me during the whole night until I did) he replied back asking me if I could give me little bit of more time because he was still chatting with his friends which I told him okay. He came back at 2:30am... I couldn't sleep so I waited for him and he just got to bed without even changing his clothes or taking his shoes off, I asked him why he came back so late, and told him that if I would be the one coming home at that time we would turn crazy about it and definitely not happy (one time I went out with a friend and came back home at 8pm and he was kinda upset about it, texting several times asking if I would get home soon) He just said \"that's why I want you to go with me when I go out so you don't get mad\" and felt asleep. I didn't know what to answer because I don't know if it is my fault for not going with him?

Regardless, as I’ve always been generally good at literary analysis, I feel I did well.I got it back at the beginning of the week, and surprisingly, I was given a 70%. The reasoning given was that although the paper itself was good, I had committed the following cardinal sins: 1) I didn’t include a title 2) I didn’t include page numbers 3) I didn’t use present tense 4) I didn’t use a works cited page.I find the last point to be especially stupid, given I did only reference one text, and was only supposed to reference one text, the book itself. I did in text citations within the essay itself, and didn’t feel the need to include a citations page. Using past tense too, it seems immaterial. The first two, fair enough, but I don’t think those marred the quality of the paper immensely. Those lapses were a product of my sleep deprived brain.I tried talking to the professor, saying I didn’t deserve 30% off, but she said she just followed her rubric. I found this unfair, as she hadn’t even made her rubric public to the students.Hence, I went to the department head, and showed him my paper. He agreed with me that it deserved better than a 70%, and mandated that it be regraded with less severe amount of points docked for the lapses. I ended up with a 92%, but the professor confronted me and said she didn’t appreciate me ‘playing politics’ to get a better grade than I deserve.I don’t think that’s fair, because I do think I deserved a higher grade than I recovers, and clearly the department head agreed.

We had been planning the wedding since before we got engaged (a bit cart before the horse) and had a date picked out over 1.5 years before the actual engagement. We picked 10/13/17, as it was a Friday the 13th in October, so super spooky, and in our favorite season. Not that it matters, but we got married young (me barely 22 and him almost 25).Annie, my old college roommate and one of my closest friends at that time was my maid of honor. I'm not a party person, so we didn't even have a wedding shower/bachelorette party, so she didn't even need to plan anything.Two weeks before my wedding, a different bridesmaid had to drop out due to taking finals she couldn't miss. That was fine, I had another friend I asked and he accepted. Then, less than a week before the wedding, my friend Annie dropped out of the wedding because her grandmother died and the memorial was the same day a couple hours earlier. (I found it weird they had it on Friday the 13th since her family is SUPER religious, but c'est la vie).I completely understood her need to be there and know it was NOT her fault. I asked if she could try and make the reception at least, and she said she couldn't. I'll admit, I was really sad, but I got over it.However, after that, I didn't hear from her for some time. She never apologized and never initiated text conversations.She ended up getting married about a year and a half later, and while I was invited to the wedding, I wasn't part of her bridal party. I decided to forgo the wedding as I knew I would just bring negative energy and didn't want to ruin her day. At this point, we hadn't spoken since MY wedding.Lately, she's been trying to \"reach out\" by leaving comments on Instagram posts and liking Facebook statuses. I refuse to acknowledge her in any way, as she never apologized for how much hurt she put me through. She is trying to act like everything is normal (years after no contact) and never even texted me, just public comments.I want to reiterate that I am not mad at her for missing my wedding, I am hurt that she didn't make an effort to come to my reception and that she never reached out to me afterwards.So Reddit, AITA because I won't forgive her and plan on never talking to her again, even if she were to apologize?EDIT: Many of you are thinking I want her to apologize for her grandmother's death. I just wished she would have apologized such as \"I'm sorry I couldn't be there with you, I wish I could have, but there were more pressing matters.\"She never asked about my wedding after, she never brought up anything. I did check in with her and text her condolences and make sure she was alright.UPDATE: I'm not going to reply to anyone anymore. If you think I'm TA, fine. That won't change how hurt and upset I was and still am. Feelings are more complicated than Reddit seems to comprehend.",

	"body" : "I (32M) have a fiancé (32F). I work between 40-60 hours a week. I go in at 1pm and get home around 11pm. Because of that I go to bed late so I end up sleeping in until about 11am. My fiancé has two jobs she works remotely and is up daily at 8:30am. She also has a son (8M) who she has about 60% of the time, the other 40% he's with his father. My fiancé starts work at 9am until 5 or 6pm. The does chores around the house and has always been in charge of grocery shopping, cooking, and caring for our dogs. I don't help out around the house during the week. My job is very physically demanding and when I get home, I'm exhausted. Usually twice a month I'll take a full Sunday to help get chores done. I often work 6 days a week, with Sun being my only day off.Last night I got home and didn't see my fiancé. I assumed she was showering and got irritated because I always shower when I get home and now I'd have to wait. Dinner hadn't even been started. When I went downstairs 30 min later, my fiancé was at the stove cooking. She saw I was upset and asked so I told her I was angry that she decided to shower right as I was getting home and that dinner wasn't started before 11pm. She said she wasn't showering but was resting due to a headache (she has them often and always says they're stress related). She said I walked right by her when I passed our bedroom door. She said I always text her when I leave work and she starts dinner so it'll still be hot when I get home, that I hadn't that night and since 'd been getting out late she didn't want dinner to get cold. She figured I'd shower and dinner would be ready once I was done. I said I'd rather heat dinner up and eat at a reasonable time than have to wait until midnight. She apologized, said she was exhausted and had just needed to rest for a little bit. I blew up and said she had no reason to be tired. She works from home and sits at a computer all day and it doesn't seem like she has work to do because I'll see her scrolling on her phone. Of course some days she will have back-to-back meetings or I'll see her really focused on whatever task she is working on, but at times I'll see her doing absolutely nothing but wiggle her mouse every few minutes. And yes she does the house chores but that's part of working from home. She's here all day and has the time to do it.She got upset and she yelled at me that she not only keeps the house afloat, she also works two jobs, takes care of me and her son, takes care of our dogs, and does a majority of the chores so she has every right to be tired and just because her jobs aren't physical, they are mentally demanding and that takes a toll too. I snapped and and said \"yes, scrolling through your phone all day must be so mentally draining.\" She got really angry, told me I'm an a-hole and hasn't spoken to me since.Yes she does a lot but so do I and if I can handle it then she she can too. So AITA?EDITED TO ADD: yes this is real and no I do not feel I was in the wrong. She has plenty of time to herself. After she finishes whatever chores she does that day after work, she usually sits down and watches a show or if her son is home, she will watch a movie with him.  You are all acting like she never gets a break, but she does.OK OK I got it. I'm the asshole. Thanks for the feedback.",

My dad and his wife have been together for almost two years now. Both of my stepsisters (17F, 18F) have their own cars that were gifts from their dad. My stepmother also has her own car. They decided that having four cars was too much so my dad sold his after we all move in together. He didn't really need it that much because he works from home and he can still use his wife's car when it is available but he has to ask for her permission beforehand unless it is a real emergency.If my dad barely can manage to use my stepmom's car, what chance will I get? Lets not even think about my stepsisters allowing me to use their cars, I think they would laugh for an entire year if I asked. And what it is even more bizarre is that my stepsisters don't even use they own cars much because their boyfriends drive them everywhere. My dad could afford to buy me a car if he wanted to and it is only fair for me to have the same accommodations my stepsisters have. Therefore, I have been demanding to get my own car for my next birthday.My dad says there is not space for another car, that I don't really need one because I don't go out that much and that I am way too young. He also says that my stepsisters having cars was a decision made by their father and not by him so he can't be held accountable for that. Just to be clear, I love my stepmom, she is a badass girlboss. I even mostly like my stepsisters, even if they are spoiled brats, they are cool and thaught me how to use make-up properly. My stepmother says she will respect what my dad says in this issue and won't try to help me convince him. My stepsisters just suggest I should get a boyfriend with a car. I have been arguing a lot with my dad about this but he won't listen to me anymore. This has created tension between us.Am I the Asshole?",

	"body" : "Edit: A lot of people are focusing on the first interaction I had with my neighbor regarding my broken exhaust for my second car, this information is only to inform you about the history and that this has happened more than once but for two different but similar reasons, The first interaction is a lot more complicated. This is about the most recent interaction with my neighbor regarding my Corvette and not my previous interaction from three years ago regarding my second car which I use specifically for the winter that had a broken exhaust which I fixedSo I’ve had my 1980 L82 for 6 years now, when I first got it I drove pretty much every day that I could, but now I drive it less often maybe one a week now. When I first got my vet I left for work at 6:30, but recently for the past 2 years I leave work earlier at 5:45This is the 2nd time she has caused a seen, both times the police were involved, she the only one in the neighborhood who wakes up from my cars (broken winter beater & corvette), I pass by 4 more houses after hers, my neighbor next door said he didn’t hear my cars but he hear her screaming lol, yup she came over after I left, banging on the door screaming about my 2nd carShe called the Police, they told her to never do that, to go onto someone’s property at 6AM to bang & scream on the doors & windows. when I got home I was informed the police officer said I had 2 days to get my 2nd car(winter beater) fixed, I was already finished welding my new exhaust that same day that she came screaming after I left, I install it when I got home after work. If she waited one more day then no one would of had to see her like that.few days before I had an officer pull me over wondering why my 2nd car(winter beater) was so loud, I told him I’m welding a new exhaust, he let me go without a ticket or warning but he told me to hurry up, if another officer pulls me over I could be told to it fix it within a timeframe, I would have two months to fix it but normally it would be two weeks to fix it but he said because of Covid right now they changed it to two months (November 2020) when I got home I heard that this officer told me I had two days, I was highly skepticalNormally I carpool with a coworker so we can both save on gas but At the time I had working hours that were not the same as my coworker so I could not carpool with them for two weeks, So I drove my Corvette, on the second week she decided to come banging on the Doors, ringing the doorbell, banging the windows where people slept, and she added some thing a little extra in this time, giving the finger to everybody and sticking her tongue out while making weird faces.So my family called the police, she was told already not to do this before and she was warned if she does it a third time she’s gonna be in trouble. The officer asked was my car modified in anyway and my family told the officer that it’s stock, all original, not modified and that I have a the paperwork to prove it, because my car is a classic car and it’s not modified the officer told her there’s nothing he can do because I’m allowed to drive it when I want to and at work, she starts screaming “he’s been ruining my life for 6 years.I’m not doing this to annoy her, because I don’t care about her I just want to enjoy my car that’s all, i’ve never floored it in front of her house eitherEdit: information regarding the First event with my neighbor goes as follows.My winter beater exhaust broke one day and so I Called a few Garage around my city and they were all busy for 2 to 3 weeks till I could get an appointment because they were changing winter tires constantly. When I described to them my situation they said it would take a brand new exhaust which would cost almost $2000. At the time this was during Covid in November and getting any parts delivered to you for your vehicle could take a very long time, I had another Garage during Covid have to order a gauge cluster for one of my cars and it took them eight months to get it, so I thought to myself who knows how long it’s going to take to get the exhaust and plus it’s $2000 I can probably make it cheaper myself and faster.On top of the fact I hadn’t worked in six months because the place I worked closed for six months during Covid so I had to live off my savings and stimulus checks and when I went back to work I had no money especially not $2000 to waste on a brand new exhaust when I could make it for a little over $300 which is what I did.At the time in my mind I didn’t have a choice to continue driving my car even though I knew it was very loud because the exhaust was broken on my winter beater car, and I knew that if I chose to not drive it I wouldn’t have any other way to get to work because I didn’t have money to get another car and I didn’t have no lifts to get to work and I didn’t have the money to even rent a car.so it was either lose my entire livelihood to let my neighbor sleep nice and sound or fix this exhaust as fast as possible, I was lucky that I had a friend who let me borrow the garage when they weren’t using it because they had a car lift to then fix and adjust the exhaust until it was finished and I did that for as long as I could in his garage till he said I had to stop for the day and normally that was around 2 to 3 hours a day sometimes only 30 min though.I didn’t know what other to do in that situation if you would’ve done something differently let me know that",

It was a really nice wedding ceremony and then later on we were sitting at the reception as the wedding party entered.The entrances were like they all were, a little ridiculous and cringey but it is what it is, just your typical wedding entrances. Then the best man and the maid of honor were introduced and in their entrance, the maid of honor twirled the best man and I thought that it was a little weird but just chalked it up to being silly and having fun.Then came the toast from the best man. In the toast, the best man didn’t use a script on his phone and just spoke to everyone, a crowd of 400, which was surprising to me because typically men, at the other weddings that I’ve been to, need some material to go off of and keep their speech going. In the speech, he didn’t really seem to touch on the more masculine things that you typically see in best man speeches but rather on things I thought were more feminine. When he finished the speech, he went directly in for a hug with the groom rather than a typical handshake or whatever else guys do.All of this and plus how much it seemed he cared about his appearance led me to say to the girl next to me; “That was a good speech and all but do you think that he is bisexual?”She responded, “Well that is his fiancé right there” as she pointed across the table to a girl, to which I then turned to her and asked the same thing, if he was bisexual.She looked confused and said, “No” to which I responded “Are you sure?”The girl next to the best man’s “fiancé”, immediately responded, “Well I am his (the best man’s) sister and I think I would know if he was.” And it turns out that I was at a table with many of the groomsmen’s plus ones and some of their family members. I took the hint to change the subject but it seemed like it was a touchy subject for some reason.The night went on and apparently word had gotten back to the groom’s family, my boyfriend is the groom’s uncle, and the grooms’s family was upset with the comments that I made, as it turns out the best man is really close to their family and felt embarrassed that someone would say this to him and some thought I should apologize to the best man and his fiancé for continuing to press questions. But I felt it was a valid question that I was curious about and even tried to defend it more by saying he seemed to care too much about his appearance and that he danced with a bunch of people and not just his fiancé throughout the night (not grinding or anything but just didn’t have his full attention on only dancing with his fiancé).This has caused a small strain in my relationship with my boyfriend because his family is upset with me but I don’t think it is valid.

She's 28 but acts 18 sometimes (think wearing crop tops, listening to Taylor swift, Olivia rodrigo, etc.) They have become very close very quick and have already moved in together.She is new to our city and was apparently bleeding money through rent so Jamie very chivalrously offered to take her in. They are now living together it's been a few weeks.Our other friends find this kinda cute since Jamie is so in love. I however have some misgivings. I know what it seems like but hear me out.There is something wrong about her. She doesn't contribute much to the household, doesn't have a high paying job. He cooks and cleans for her (she does it too but Jamie also picks up the slack). She stays in his house and doesn't pay rent.I find all these things to be red flags. He is moving very fast and is totally smitten by her. Jamie will do whatever she asks. Alina recently asked him not to be vegan as she doesn't believe in it and he agreed. He was seriously considering joining me in a plant-based diet at the least.The real shocker happened when I went to see Jamie and talked to him about this. I told him all the misgivings I feel about his and Alina's relationship and listed out all the things that make me uncomfortable.To my surprise, this very calm, very rational individual suddenly got really ice cold with me. Jamie told me he doesn't want to hear anything about Alina and unfortunately she was eavesdropping? (don't know for sure) but she heard everything. Her eyes got all big and she started crying like a baby.This made Jamie's anger worse and he told me to leave. The last 48 hours I've been walking like in a dream. Like wtf just happened. A few of our mutual friends called me and asked me if I was out of my fricking mind and told me I should have minded my own business.I'm baffled. EVERYONE is on her side.

Half the time I'm sweating profusely while my wife is shivering. Anything over 65ish° is too hot for me. I've had to compromise a lot since my wife had our daughter 2 months ago because obviously the baby needs it to be warmer than 65°.Well, yesterday I was really struggling. I had just been doing a bunch of yard work and despite it being 40° outside, I was sweating. When I came inside it was 71° and despite taking a cold shower, it was too hot in the house to function. I went in to our bedroom, which is also the nursery and I turned off the heat and turned the fan on me while I sat at my computer and relaxed a bit. The baby was sleeping in her crib. I hadn't intended on leaving the heat off for more than a half hour or so; just long enough to cool down, but I forgot I turned it off honestly. So when my wife came in to the room to collect our daughter and hour and a half later, the bedroom was 63°. She immediately flipped out on me because our daughter has been having a runny nose lately and my wife is convinced it's due to me constantly \"fucking with the room temps\". She says that going from warm to \"freezing\" to warm to \"freezing\" repetitively is the reason why our daughter has the sniffles. She said if I keep messing with the room temperatures than she will leave. I told her that me shutting the heat off so that I can be comfortable for awhile before going to sleep (when the heat is on) isn't a big deal and it's selfish of her to think I should be in constant discomfort. I told her that she and the baby can put more clothes on, whereas I can't take anything else off. She said something to the affect of \"Selfish? Try being an overweight fucking guy who puts his needs above his own babies health. You can take shit off. Try going to the gym.\" She ended up leaving and going to a hotel and says she won't be returning until it's warmer outside so that I'm not \"forcing\" her and my daughter to live in misery due to me overheating because of my weight and stated that until I take responsibility for my issues and try bettering myself, she will be considering leaving for good.

We went back and forth a bit until I said “it’s just what I’ve been raised to believe, that people who don’t eat that way don’t know how to eat properly and are low class.” She started to cry. I said I was only stating a fact about how I’ve been raised and it’s no reason to cry. She said I don’t get to set criteria for when crying is ok, and that me saying that implies that I think she doesn’t know how to eat properly and is low class. I said no, it doesn’t. We kept going back and forth for a bit and I said the reason I brought it up is because my family will most likely judge her for eating that way, so at Easter dinner when my extended family comes over, she might want to consider using utensils the way we do if she wants to make a good impression. She has had a rocky relationship with my mother so I was trying to be helpful and help her avoid her judgment.She’s still upset and says what I said may have been “fact” but it’s still hurtful and that I’m not thinking about it from her perspective.

We got into an argument about this the other day. She hasn't had a TV in her apartment ever since she moved in and decided she finally wanted to buy one. She immediately went on Amazon and bought the first 32 inch TV she saw. It came in two days and I was with her when she was setting it up. The first thing that came out of her mouth was \"hmm, this is really small\" and she proceeded to debate with me for the next 15 minutes on whether or not she should return it and get a new one.I told her that it was fine and she sort of agreed at first but then she was like \"nah I don't like this size\" and she immediately goes on Amazon and buys the same TV in 60 inches. I told her that she was being really impulsive and has no patience and that she's dumb to not even look at the return policy before impulsively buying a bigger one.She said that if she can't return the smaller one, she'll just keep it in her bedroom and that it wouldn't be a loss.

John messaged my husband and their friends a few months ago to let them know that he and Maria would be visiting for the holidays and thinking about moving here, so we planned to have a gift exchange with my friends and my husband's friends (including John and Maria).We did all this on Christmas day, but about a week before Christmas we attended a welcome home party for John, where I met Maria for the first time. I had a neutral feeling towards her. I don't dislike her, I just think we are very different people and have nothing to talk about or bond over. She did seem to think she was better than everyone though (at one point someone made a comment about her engagement ring and John said that it didn't contain diamonds/stones that were mined because Maria wanted something that was more sustainable and better for the environment??? which seemed a bit braggy).The day of the gift exchange we all opened the secret Santa gifts first, and then we opened our gifts from our partners. When it was Maria's turn, she opened John's gift which was a few books wrapped in some newspaper and string, and a journal. I didn't really think much of it at first but then as she was looking all of the books I noticed that a lot of them had bent spines and covers, and looked to be old/used which was a bit off-putting since I know John makes good money.When one of my friends took her turn after Maria, I joked: \"I hope your gift isn't also  someone else's sloppy-second hand-me-downs!\" My joke kinda bombed and everyone went quiet and looked at me and Maria. Maria kinda tried to hide the books, but John spoke up and said that he only bought used books because Maria only buys used books and again brought up how it's supposedly better for the environment and more \"sustainable\". At this point, I kinda doubled down because I was embarrassed that everyone was looking at me like I had just murdered a puppy, but the mood quickly soured and John and Maria left shortly after that without even waiting for the rest of us to open our gifts.Now everyone is upset with me and saying that I was being rude and unwelcoming and that Maria is really nice and didn't deserve that. My husband wants me to apologize but I'm not sure if I should since I obviously didn't and couldn't have known that Maria wanted used items and it was supposed to be a funny joke.EDIT: Okay, I get it.

I'm not sure how to describe it. He had pads and a skateboard but he only rode it maybe once every 10 minutes. But something about his look just seemed off to me. He also reeked of marijuana smoke. Finally he actually ran into my son while they were at the bottom of one of the pools and I had enough because it seemed so deliberate. I first asked him if he had kids, he said something really creepy like \"these are all my kids.\" I said maybe it's time he found a new hobby. He was so incoherent I don't know what he said next but it was something about his \"soul\" which really creeped me out. So I told him flat out I think it's time that he left. He said he was leaving anyways in 20 minutes since he had to work. I told him maybe he should just leave now. He said no. I said I was calling the police and finally he said that he didn't want any trouble and he'd leave. I told him if he didn't want trouble maybe he should chose age appropriate activities. What I hadn't noticed is that several of the teens were close by and when he left they said things like \"maybe your fat ass should be the one to leave!\" and b-word and c-word and on and on. I had also brought over a specialty concert chair to sit on and one of the kids had thrown it over the fence into the main park.  This truly scared my kids. I dialed 911 and we left the park. It took almost 4 hours for the police to come to our house and the officer said that in the future I should call them right away.however my husband is furious with me. He thinks that I've instantly made us a \"marked\" family in the neighborhood and maybe the older man really was there to enjoy himself. My point is my husband wasn't there and I tried to act on my own instincts and they telling me this older man was up to no good.",

A few years back I was in a shop and he accused my friend who is from african descent if he took a shit in shops elevator which of course is not true and he just started accusing him of doing that and saying that my friend apparently recorded him. The community officer then proceeded to record my friend and asked for his name and how old he is. Bear in mind it is not just me and him and there is about 6+ of us yet he only targeted him.

After he then threatens to tell my school I kick it into a storm drain but because there is a muddy puddle above it the cap just floats there. Then he tells me to pick it up and put it in the bin I say that there is no way I’m touching that muddy water.

My wife has only been there once, as baby, and although we both like travelling and speak several languages, we both don't intend to ever go there.We recently visited my in-laws and I noted that my wife and her mum spoke an unusual high amount of the language of my in-laws. My wife learnt this language when she grew up but it had always been a habit that they speak in English when I am there. (She and her siblings talk in English to each other unless they don't want people to understand what they say.)When we left I told my wife it's very rude to not talk in English to her mum in front of me. She told me I don't get to tell her in what language she talks to her mum (in front of me).AITA?Update since this was not clear: I assume their conversation was about me and the kids, as they would normally talk in English.Thanks a lot for your comments. Some of you helped me to see what my problem was. My wife suffered quite a bit through her parents' culture (shaming) and I connect the language with it. In a way my behaviour is indeed controlling as I don't want her to be back to this bad place (figuratively). But trying to tell her what language to speak does not get us anywhere.

He can grow a pretty thick and long beard which I love! It was one of his physical features that attracted me to him. I was very supportive of him trimming his beard so I agreed to help. We purchased a very nice high end trimmer and last night I helped him trim it. At first it was only half an inch then he said no lets do 1 inch. We took  before photos and once I finished with the 1in and showed him a progress photo he said it was still long. He said to go for a closer shave. I had agreed to a trim not a shave. I trimmed another inch and showed him a photo. He again insisted on a very close shave. In the end I gave in and gave him what he asked for. I realized once the beard came off completely how different he looked and I started crying. He understood why I started crying and assured me his beard will grow back in 4 months. He looked completely different from the man I started shaving 30 minutes prior. Once I was done and he jumped in the shower I went into our guest room and cried for a bit. I was so upset that him shaving his beard had such an emotional toll on me. I was so mad at myself for reaching this way. When he was done showering and looked at himself in the mirror he didn't seem too happy either as he had never shaved his beard before. He didn't tell me anything but the look on his face said it all. I texted my brother to calm me down and told him about what had just happened. He said I was an asshole for overreacting to something as simple as a beard trim. He said I should have been more cheerful of my boyfriend's decision and reassured him he looked great with or without a beard. My boyfriend was fine today but kept touching his face all day saying how different he feels. I told him he is handsome and that's been my only comment.

I used to live in a neighborhood in Toronto with a predominant Italian population.Our childhood grocery store was Italian run and while you could make due in English shopping there, you can forget about the patisserie counter, deli counter, etc unless you spoke at least some proficiency in Italian. Pointing at food only got you so far since many of the employees spoke Italian first.It's been 25 years since I've been to this grocer and for some nostalgia sake as well as I had some errands in Toronto, I drove up and thought I'd surprise my husband back home with some nice cold cuts and pastries from my old stomping grounds.I'm doing my shopping and I can tell things have changed. I know the grocer is still family run but a lot of the employees are no longer Italian. This is whatever. I do my shopping and get to the deli counter and start asking for some specific things and half of the things I wanted, the employee doesn't know what it is or cannot find it.This employee isn't Italian, so I ask her if there's an Italian employee who can help me. This would go a lot faster and smoother if I can ask for what I want in Italian. Plus, an Italian employee is going to know every single thing I ask for and where to find it. A lot of products have Italian names or I don't know the name but can describe it well enough in Italian.I guess my request was taken abrasive but she ended up calling over someone who could speak Italian and off we go. The first employee told me it was rude to speak in a different language in their presence and she assumed I was talking about her without her knowing. She said it was racist to assume she couldn't do her job because of her ethnicity/language. I just wanted some cold cuts.Was I the asshole?",

I opened up a bank account in her name and put all the money in it.

Most places were closed because it was around 11:30pm at night and it was Easter Sunday, and the only place still open was the ice cream shop so instead of going hungry we jst said f-it we'll get ice cream.By the time we get to the shop it's around 11:55 pm, 5 minutes before it's supposed to close. As soon as we walk in though I see only about half the lights are on and it looks pretty closed, but there is still one worker left. We walk up, say hi, and start to give her our order. 2 milkshakes and 2 sundays. The worker stops us and says that we can't get that, but she would be happy to scoop us ice cream. I ask why we can't get what we originally wanted and her response was that because it was so close to closing and she hadn't had many customers in the last 30 she was planning closing at 12 so all the utensils had already been washed and toppings put away.I asked why she couldn't clean the utensils and put the toppings away after making our order and she just said that if we wanted plain ice cream we were welcome to it, but she wasn't going to make anything else. Me and my buddies were looking at each other because while I understood she was hoping to leave by 12, we came in before closing and technically they were supposed to be still serving customers. We kind of started to argue a bit, and then the worker just up and told us we could \"leave then\" since it was past 12 by then and we weren't ordering.I told her she was out of line and she went into a big speech about how she opened at 11 am that morning and had been there all day and hadn't gotten a break and apparently her 3 year old was at home with a fever getting looked after by her mom, it was a lot. I asked her what that had to do with her shitty customer service and she just said to get out and we finally left.I've been contemplating calling the owner about this because my dad owns a few restaurants back in my home town, and this little ice cream place is a local small place and I know how much crappy customer service can make or break a small business.",

Due to the pandemic, she was furloughed. During this period she cooked every night and did all the chores and washing in the house, although not as quickly or thoroughly as I would have liked.My daughter decided to go to university to retrain. Due to a massive drop in income, she asked if I would be able to pay for groceries now. I said that was fine, but I expected her to continue covering all household chores. She also picked up a part-time job in order to finance her commute.Throughout Dec/Jan her work hours increased due to many members of staff isolating due to covid. This was also as her first assessments and exams were due. As a result she noticeably slacked on her responsibilities at home. She still cooked and cleaned up for dinner, but not doing the other tasks I expected. I also felt like she was not spending enough time with me, which had been the initial reason I asked her to move in. I spoke to her about it and she apologised and said she was getting overwhelmed with everything and needed to reprioritise things starting with asking for a reduction in her working hours.A few days passed and I noticed no change in what she was doing. The last straw was when I noticed she had left a massive mess in her room as well as her ashtray. We both smoke in the house but I asked that she not smoke in her room. When I confronted her she said she had moved the ashtray into her room the night before as the bin is out back of the house which gets very cold in the evening, and she didnt want to get in trouble as I told her she has to empty it every day before she goes to sleep. I dont know if she is lying but either way she broke the rules, so the next day when she was out I took her door away as she cant be trusted. She said that was a violation of her privacy and left to go to her mothers for a few days. About 3 hours away.We continued arguing for a few days, until I told her I didnt want her living with me anymore. She said that that was my decision. She came back on the saturday as she had work and I told her she wasnt welcome to stay here anymore. She asked where she was supposed to sleep that night, and I said that wasnt my problem. I dont know where she stayed but when she came back the next day I took her key and wouldn't let her in the house just piled her stuff in the door. We ended up arguing more when I wouldn't let her in to check she had everything, nor would I let her get her kitchen things as she was going back to her mums so wouldnt need them. I also didn't give her the gifts I had given her over the years or let her say good bye to the dog as I didnt want her in my house.So aita for getting sick of my daughter taking advantage of me and kicking her out the day before her birthday.",

Very quickly my husband noticed she started talking to and hanging out with a man who is in my husbands friend group but not friends with my husband directly.My husband was upset because he claims she deceived us by telling us she wanted to come visit me. But he let it go and I supported my sister. They got engaged in December. It caused a bit of a fight because I was happy for my sister and didn’t understand why he couldn’t be.He claims that this is very shady and she’s likely using this guy too. He’s been very mean making comments about how this is the fifth foreigner she’s been engaged to etc.He asked my sister if she planned on leaving at the time that she told CBP she was leaving, and the time her passport says she must leave.She said no. He told her to get out of our house she’s not welcome to stay here anymore. Her fiance came and picked her up, and they’ve lived together since.My husband and I talked about it and he claims that her doing this casts a lot of suspicion on to our relationship and risks my naturalization. He says that he worked hard and gave up his 20s for us to be together and I’m risking all of that for my sister.He keeps bringing up that she blocked me for a year, has hid things from me, and more. He’s bringing it up because he thinks she will do it again. He said she hasn’t changed because everything she’s done from the moment this trip was planned has been a lie.My sister apologized for all that. When I tell him that he says that he told me that would happen when she cut me out of her life. He says “I told you as soon as she needs or wants something from you she’ll be back” and that I should be suspicious of her.He has told me he doesn’t want to ruin our relationship but he said I shouldn’t trust her.

He claims this guy is a jerk to other women, and he’s upset that this started because this guy was telling me about his problems when he was drunk at a party we went to. He said I should have shut him down and told him that it’s not appropriate to talk to me about his problems. I introduced him to my sister that night.AITA?",

He was in an intensive care unit for 10 days.Ever since the accident my boyfriend has been paying all of his bills including his medical. He’s been there for all of his appointments, he has a whole notebook dedicated to his medication’s and diagnosis.The issue I have is, his brother just recently started working to pay rent. If he is capable of taking care of himself and can work back at his previous job, I’m wondering why is my boyfriend still paying for everything for him. He has his credit card in his wallet!On top of finding out all of this information, living with his brother I’ve found out how ungrateful and disrespectful he is.The first time I blew up on him, was when he was calling my boyfriend a N***er and a mother fucker for 10 minutes straight. He is always telling my boyfriend how he is never there for him and that he needs to be because he was there for him a previous time before.My boyfriends response to it is that he’s just mentally ill. He doesn’t know what he’s saying because of his traumatic brain injury and that he is not himself anymore. I’ve been around him long enough to believe he is just being manipulative and acting entitled. I think he’s putting off being put on disability so his brother can continue to baby him by paying for everything.Another thing is he’s a complete control freak, if I anyone lays anything outside our bedroom he will go on an anger spiel demanding us to pick up after ourselves. I’ve already had a problem with him throwing my things away. He takes up 80% of the house because all he does is sit on his ass watching tv in the living room. I’ve resorted to just staying in the bedroom because I had enough of hearing his complaining how no one listens or gives a damn about what he’s going through.I’ve listened to him for a year I no longer have sympathy for him anymore. I think he’s being a mooch and manipulating his brother and everyone around him to feel sorry for him.He was previously going to live with his Aunt when the landlord threatened to not renew the lease. I think my boyfriend should stop being his caretaker and make him live with his Aunt.

When I came across Sandals Montego Bay, I knew the resort was the perfect place for my fiance and I to get married. My fiance just wants me to be happy and was fine with the idea, while the rest of my family and friends weren’t so satisfied. The resort would cost at least $5,000-$7,000 per couple during their stay, with an additional $1,000 per person in airfare. Additionally, no kids are allowed at Sandals resorts, and the resort is strongly geared toward couples only - there are no singles rates, and exceptions are only made for singles attending a wedding. Due to the cost and restrictions, my fiance's mom, my three grandparents, brother, uncle, cousins and the friends I invited cannot attend. As of right now, there are about 20 people attending my wedding, but I am fine with it because it is at my dream destination. One of the reasons I chose it is that the wedding is basically free, and with a certain number of booked rooms, my fiance and I will not have to pay for many of the costs of our trip. We normally wouldn’t be able to afford to go there. Some of my relatives and friends have complained that they want to be there to support me, but they can’t come because of the cost, distance, and couples-only rules. They’ve asked if I could have a wedding closer to home or do something else, but I only want to have the wedding at the resort in Jamaica. I believe my wedding should be the way I want it. My fiance supports all of my decisions, but sometimes I question if I am making the right choice because so many of my friends and relatives can’t be there. I wonder if I’ll look back at my wedding and wish my grandparents, brother and other loved ones were there. Maybe I should just have my honeymoon in Jamaica, or choose a less expensive/closer destination so more people would be able to come. I’m just really excited to get married on the beach, and spend the week there with my fiance/husband. I’m not planning to spend a lot of time with our guests after the wedding. I think the resort will be a fun place for everyone, and after we get married, I just want to be alone with my husband. I have told people this and I think they understand. I was happy with my decision until others began to question it. Now I’m not sure if I am doing the right thing. I am starting to think I’m the asshole for excluding family and friends from my wedding because I chose an expensive, international destination that means they have to take time off work and away from their lives to attend. My choice means people who could have come to my wedding if it were held at home can’t come. AITA?",

We got together when Jo was about 4-5 months, but I’ve known Sadie since a bit before she found out she was pregnant.Anyway. We moved in together over a year ago and Sadie works from home and keeps Jo home with her to save on daycare costs. I work 2 jobs for the time being so I can get my hours up for my certification so I can be eligible to work alone and not under someone. Because of this I am often tired.I never have days off and by time I get home I basically have enough energy to eat dinner and pass out. The whole situation started a while ago when Sadie mentioned she would like to try to go out once or twice a month. I explained i might not be able to commit to that but I’ll try my best.At first it was ok but bringing Jo along with us prolonged the evening often or wasn’t as relaxing as just a date so by the end of the night I was either irritated or more tired than before.We had a talk and Sadie agreed to put Jo in part time daycare so we could have more adult time together. But she only put her in 3 days a week and it’s usually during the times I’m working so when I get home I still don’t have a break or just adult time, but Sadie does.Recently one of her cousins moved close to us and Sadie paid him to watch Jo after hours so we could have a date. I had an amazing time and suggested Jo pulls her from daycare and just has her cousin watch her for date night once in a while.We got into an argument because she feels like I just don’t want to be around Jo and I feel like I should be able to request alone time with my lady away from a child that at the end of the day isn’t my responsibility. Sadie said I knew from day one what I was getting into when pursing her but I feel like I signed up to be with HER not be a replacement dad. I understand Jo will always be there, but Sadie can’t expect me to be happy to see an upset toddler after working 15-18 hours at 2 jobs nearly EVERYDAY and the few times we get to go on a date we have to spend most of dinner making sure Jo doesn’t have a tantrum or is entertained.I love Sadie I really do, but since Jo is hers she should be responsible for finding childcare and making sure we have alone time.

My mum is at a conference in Maui with my Dad, and thought it would be great if we could all meet there.More context: my wife is the primary carer for our son and is currently home full time with him whilst I work full time.My wife is upset that I would consider taking him without her and thinks I’m being unreasonable.Her reasons:Our son has never been separated from her for more than a few hours.Our son doesn’t go readily to strangers and whilst my parents are family to me, they are strangers to him.it’s unfair to take him on his first overseas trip without her, she wants us to experience this as a family, together.we are a package deal, it’s all of us or none of us.I’ve never had our son for more than a day on my own, she thinks it’s too much to manage a 2 year old on my own, on his first OS flight and then for a week with people who are strangers to him, with no support. I think my parents will help, she thinks our son will struggle because he doesn’t know them and will want his mum.She is worried he will have separation anxiety and doesn’t want to throw him in the deep end. She would prefer to manage separation by starting slowly, like a day a week at pre school, not a week in a different country without her.she is a first time mum, she flat out does not want our son to go overseas without her.she thinks it’s more reasonable that my parents travel here rather than ask our 2 year old to travel there without her. They are the adults. My Dad has recently had an operation and doesn’t want to do such a long flight.I can’t help but also think, the bigger reason she doesn’t want us to go is because she doesn’t like my parents.Regardless of the strained relationships, I want our son to meet my parents and we can’t afford to go without their help.Am I the asshole for accepting my parents offer, and taking our 2 year old to visit them overseas, without my wife?UPDATE: formatting for ease of reading",

	"body" : "I'm a 27F who is with a 27M and has a 22M brother. My brother struggles with a lot of mental health issues and hasn't gotten a job or finished any schooling. He normally lives with our mother but living both she and our father when he can't handle her (divorced, separate home) pushes him to the brink all of the time (similar happened to me too). One parent is unable to be in the wrong and seems to gaslight in every situation so they are never wrong/at fault, even if it means being hurtful to us or denouncing our feelings.The other is difficult to live w for other reasons, including the people they have as roommates.We went over to visit my brother and have fun. A screaming fight breaks out between brother and parent 1. Things end with him not feeling safe in his own home and looking for a way out (same for parent 1). If he goes to parent 2's house he gets in a different cycle of bs only to inevitably go back to parent 1. I am the only other person my brother has left to turn to. And in the last year, I have seen him get section 12'd at least 3 times, visit multiple mental hospitals, and go off his meds and end up lost in the woods without shoes or a jacket.So that night they were fighting I panicked. I told him to pack a bag and got my partner on the phone (he had been in the car avoiding the fight). He did NOT want my brother to come to our house. I may trust my brother, mostly, but he does not. We had just moved me out a few months ago so my partner probably felt like we escaped.I tried to give my partner a choice but essentially decided that my brother should come with us. That was my bad. I probably should've taken no for an answer but I felt backed into a corner.My brother seems super calm with us and of course asks if staying long term and taking up the one empty room we have would be ok. I've felt guilty for having a spare room and bed this whole time while we've watched our friends and family members face homelessness and turmoil. But my partner doesnt want this so I tell my brother he has to leave after a couple days and now both people are angry with me. After multiple screaming fights with parent 1 giving bs ultimatums and even trying to deny him from coming back, I can't sleep. My brother is dejected and probably feeling hurt that we won't house him in a perfectly good room. I tried to explain to him that I'm unable to offer the room because we didn't get approval from the landlord (true). I'm also out of a job right now due to a mass layoff and need to focus on my interviews and presentations coming up. I need to focus, and after losing all of my work friends and then our grandmother passing a week after the layoff, I'm on the brink of going back to therapy. But my brother is by all means worse off. I dont know what to do and everything that could help him costs money. I've hurt both him and my partner now.",

	"body" : "So I was the \"director\" of a racing series (not illegal racing like in the NFS games, it was legal sanctioned racing) meaning i was responsible for ensuring nothing bad happens on and off track.One day the final race was approaching. Two people, Max (24m) and Lewis (36m) were level on points in the finale.The race started as normal. Max started from 1st but Lewis passed him and led most of the race, though Max did manage to catch up to him somewhat thanks to his teammate whom I only know the nickname of - Checo. On the last lap, Nicholas - one of the greatest drivers of all time - crashed his car. I did what every normal race director would and called out the safety car. If you aren't familiar with racing, think of when a crash happens on the highway and the police orders everyone to slow down. Now it is somewhat similar in racing, except the safety car drives around the track, ahead of everyone, and nobody may overtake it.FIA rules say that when the safety car is about to come in, everyone is required to pass it. However, I only let the lapped cars between Lewis and Max pass. Then the race resumed when the safety car came in. Max went to change his tires, but Lewis refused to.Then the manager of Lewis called me and told me \"NO my name, NO, THAT WAS SO NOT RIGHT!\" He was clearly criticizing the fact that I only let the lapped cars past and allowed the race between Lewis and Max for 1st to be closer. Eventually Max won the race and the championship.After the race I went to social media and everyone was calling me a mafia boss or something, were lobbying for me to be fired, and a protestor even made a selfie of him projecting \"Give Lewis His Championship Back\" onto a UK Parilament building (which is vandalism, which is illegal.)My intentions weren't to rig the race. It's not the first time I get into controversy. Fans of Max were mad because I was \"biased towards Lewis\", and now the tables have turned, and I am apparently biased towards Max.So I turned to Reddit to find the age-old question: AITA?",

	"body" : "I have aspergers and have hemi pelagic migraines (these migraines can mess with my emotional state) which has made it hard for me to hold down a job. My mom has helped me and let me stay in her house even though I'm 31 years old. My mom will buy groceries for us, help us out with money if we make dumb mistakes, buy us tickets to disney land but she has weird hang ups about her car. So most of the time my mom lets me take the car to do whatever, but sometimes for no reason she will decide to not let me use the car.Tonight was one of those nights, I had made plans to meet up with my girlfriend tonight at her party which is super far. We had been fighting so I wanted to at least show up to her party and give her some flowers and a kiss when the ball drops. So I ask my mom if i can use the car at around 4 o clock, she flat out just says no. I understand it's her car and she can do what she wants with it, but I thought it was pretty cold to flat out just say no on new years. So I said you know it's kind of unfair to not let me go out tonight just for no reason especially when I'm dependent on the car for transportation. She told me I'm not dependent and I can go get a job if I want to get a car and that she doesn't want me driving on new years because people get drunk. I think continued to say well you let me use it to go to bars occasionally and people are drunk their whats the difference? she couldn't really give me an answer.She then brought up some credit card debt that she recently helped me pay off after i lost my last job due to missing work too much due to my migraines. Atm my migraines have made me pretty emotional and have made me quicker to anxiety and anger which sucks. So back to the argument, she told me that since she had helped me pay off 800$ on my credit card debt that I don't have the money to go hang out with my girlfriend. Which is somewhat true but she agreed to pay off my credit card debt so.. I have money now in my account because I recently helped my uncle move to his cabin in the mountains. So it was a 4 hour drive and i had to unload a bunch of crap and sleep on hardwood floors, deal with this guy who zooms past people on the freeway in the rain, road rages frequently calling people dumb asses, honks and while we were commuting nearly hit 3 cars. My uncle is a crazy right wing q anon guy who hates women and tries to convert people to Christianity and thinks people who don't repent go to hell. So this guy would also yell at me and call me a dumb ass and tell me to try to be normal if i didn't put things where he wanted me to, this is what I was dealing with 1 day ago. So I have 500$ in my account right now with christmas money and moving money, and she's holding the debt over my head so i can't use the car. I knew she had planned for us to go to disney land on sunday and that it would be kind of a low blow but.. I said fine then I guess I'm not going to disneyland this sunday. Her jaw kind of dropped and she was really mad and said fine then I guess you're not going. AITA",

Some members of the program enjoyed it, but others saw it as a necessary hoop to jump through to indulge their interest in discussion based philosophy and theology classes, which was the other facet of the program. Thus, a lot of my friends decided to make the former easier on themselves and copied off of others for Greek homework.I personally didn’t do this, but my friends did, and I don’t think this hurt anybody. The class itself isn’t graded on a curve, so one doing well by cheating doesn’t lessen somebody else’s grade. However, one member of the 20 found it ‘immoral’ and so turned these students in to the professor, leading to their grades taking a dive.I found this, for lack of a better term, a dick move. They weren’t hurting anybody, and yet he decided to be a snitch regardless. I began to wonder if he would do something similar with other examples of ‘rule breaking’— underage drinking, drug use, etc— that he was privy to, since he demonstrated a belief in the rules for their own sake regardless of if breaking them hurt somebody.Thus I decided it was safer to just stop inviting him to anything were any rule breaking. This resulted in him no longer being invited to essentially any social event, and he was essentially a pariah.After the summer was over, I still mostly avoid him. Today, he confronted me and said I was an AH for ostracizing him from my friend group for following his morals. I think that’s stupid, because what did he expect?

The sister herself is named after that same grandmother. My SIL does not have a great relationship with my husband and me. On the day of my wedding, she was visible pregnant and as many family members hadn’t previously known she was, it was heavily talked about, which I found quite upsetting.When my son (3M) was born we made a point to give him a name that did not have any relation to either of our families. However, I knew since before my husband and I got married that if I had a daughter, I wanted to give her a particular name. I was distraught on the day my niece was born and we found out threw my FIL that they had given her the name I had already chosen.The next week when we were able to visit the baby, I mentioned to SIL that I had really liked that name and inquired if she would change it. She laughed thinking I was joking but I told her I was serious and that I would really appreciate if she would change it. She didn't even consider it and told me no. We ended up leaving not long after because I was quite upset. My husband texted her after we left telling her it was rude of her to not consider what we were asking. She never replied but my husband got into an argument with their older brother a few days later about it and told us we were being weird to even ask, especially because we didn't know if we would have a daughter. He apparently also made a comment about my age and how I shouldn’t have any more kids (I was 40 with my first).Our daughter was born a few months ago. After we found out she would be a girl we went back and forth about what we should name her. In the end we knew we had to do what felt right and give her the name we wanted. We kept this a secret from my husband’s family until the day after she was born. My FIL seemed a little shocked we had still picked that name but didn't really say much about it. My BIL called us disrespectful to give our daughter the same name. He said not only was it harsh on SIL but also both the girls. He thinks we are assholes, although his wife has been more supportive of our choice and understands/doesn't think it will be a big issue. My husband and SIL aren't close, and we only see them a few times a year at family gatherings.The big issue is that they actually have the same surname. While pregnant with her daughter SIL left her husband and claimed he was abusive to her and her older son. So when her daughter was born, she gave her her maiden name. She has since changed her surname and that of her son. A friend of mine thinks it would have been weird if they only shared the same first name but thinks considering they share the same last name as well it makes me the asshole for using the name as it’s confusing having to people around the same age with almost identical names.

So I told her to smile again, and she made the same dorky face she always does. This made me and Andrew laugh, and I gently told her \"you're so ridiculous\". I meant it in an endearing way, but Maya got flustered and said she had to go home early, and she left.Nowadays, I can sense some tension between me and Maya, and I can tell that she intentionally does her best to put on a frown at all times. I kind of feel bad for her.AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for making my daughter (19F) feel bad?",
	"body" : "I (45F) am the mother of 3 children (19F, 17M and 14M). My eldest daughter is in college but came back home last Friday to study for her exams, my sons are both high schoolers.Yesterday I left the house to run some errands, while my daughter and her youngest sibling stayed home. I trust them completely obviously since they are old and wise enough to stay home alone, I thought...While I was away, my youngest son apparently wanted to eat some fresh peaches, my husband had just bought. When he opened one of them, there were some \"white spots\" around the seed. My son was concerned about that and asked his older sister for advice. She agreed that it looked bad and thus he threw the peach away.Now if they had done that to 1 peach, that would be fine, but they kept opening peaches and throwing them away because of the \"white spots\".  They ended up leaving 2 peaches of the whole bunch.When I came home that night and opened the trash can, I saw all those cut peaches laying there and I couldn't be more furious. The \"white spots\" are just normal spots when the peach isn't ripe yet.I was livid, but my kids were already asleep so I decided to confront her the next morning when we were having breakfast. I told her my heart broke when I saw those peaches and that I expect her to take responsibility and pay them back. She got all defensive and argued \"she wouldn't pay it, because she already pays the gas for the car, our Netflix etc\".I pointed out that by being so defensive, she was not taking responsibility for her actions. I left it at that and I didn't actually expect her to pay anything back. I just said it so she would think twice in the future before throwing perfectly fine food out.Now today is a holiday so all the stores were closed (except for a few out of town). I noticed however my daughter getting ready to go to the store \"because she needed something\". She came back with a new bag of peaches.I was surprised that she was still going on about that little discussion: I just made a comment about it, I didn't expect her to ACTUALLY refund the peaches. I said she needed to be more resistent against criticism and shouldn't get pissed at every comment I make because that's not very adultish.She got mad (again LOL) and said that I am an asshole for not being appreciative of her getting the peaches.So Reddit: AITA?EDIT: I really need to clarify some things  hereI do not hate or despise my daughter, I love her very much and she loves me too. We have a pretty good bond as she calls me every day while in college! After her rough teenage years, we are finally starting to build a bond.I confronted her about it during breakfast, so the rest of the family was there and all heard about it, so I am not \"favoring my sons\"I do not abuse my daughter, I am trying to better her.",

The problem, is I want him to at least experience real fun.2 weeks ago, I brought some beer with my money, and went to his house, I drank a bit then said hey, have a try. He declined, saying he doesn’t drink, his religion doesn’t allow him to, and even if he could, he wouldn’t. He proceeds to ask me why I enjoy drinking something that destroys the brain, and I was deeply offended, beer isn’t bad.(He’s a muslim). So, I made up a plan. He won’t hate it, if he doesn’t know it’s beer. So, last week, we were hanging out, and went to a mall. We bought some stuff, and I bought apple juice. Skip to last 4 days, he came over, (note: no lockdown where we live) and I put some beer, he asked what it is and I said oh, just some apple juice. Also, i poured some for me and said, let’s see who can chug it all first?He was skeptical, but went for it, and drank all of it, he just made a weird face and said it tastes weird. That night, he called and asked if I was vomiting/dizzy/feel weird. I said no.The side effects was making him vomit, feel dizzy and weird. Well, because of that I felt guilty and told him, and, he flipped out at me, shouting at how it tasted disgusting, made him vomit, feel dizzy, he couldn’t sleep because he kept feeling like he’s spinning whenever he closes his eyes. I said bullshit and he’s making stuff of to get mad at me.I don’t think I’m the AH because I wanted him to have some fun, I think he’s the asshole for not understanding that.

Jim, myself and another guy share the 1st floor and a bathroom, when i asked him to share the toilet paper (thing we do) he refused saying he prefered bringing his own roll of toilet paper. we found it weird but its not that of a problem. the real problem, which we named the « Guevara gate » started a few days ago. i was searching through some of my old stuff when i stumbled upon a small photo of Che Guevara. i decided to place this photo on the fridge. it is important to know that my roomates and myself have all the same political opinions and there are many obvious clues regarding that throughout the house (posters of syndicates etc). because Jim never said anything i didnt thougt it would be a problem. the evening following that, i went to the kitchen and saw that the photo was still on the fridge but turned over. i thought it was a joke from one of my roomates who tends to do such things just to mess with ppl. i replaced the photo. the next day, the photo had been taken from the fridge and was on the table, turned over. I sent a message in the group chat with all the roomates. everybody explained that they had nothing to do with that except Jim who did not answered. i was very suspicious about him and one of my roomates decided to knock on his door and ask him. he confesed that it was ideed him and justified himself by saying that he « didnt want politics in the house ». later, we discussed it with the other (without him) and everyone agreed on the fact that he acted like a weirdo and that we will not agree to remove the photo. so what do you all think ? are we the assholes ?EDIT : i think we can summarize most of the answers by « YTA bc you’re a communist » Thank you for missing the point of my question. i will not answer or elaborate further. good night",

Amelia was the quietest out of all of us, where Nicole and Alex quickly became my psych friends.later in the semester Amelia's eyes were super puffy and she just looked off. I asked her if she was doing okay and she told me not really, her boyfriend cheated on her and just moved out and she wasn't sure about how she'd pay her rent in full.I told her I was worried about affording my apartment next year, but thankfully my parents will be paying my  portion of rent and asked her if she could get her parents to help her out? It was meant to be a nice suggestion, but Amelia instead looked at me like I was an idiot and said (exact word for word): you want to be a counselor, right? Well I'm going to tell you something that's going to blow your mind, and something more psych classes should tell you, not all of us have parents or parents who are cash cows.Alex told her that was enough and I was just being nice and Nicole and I went to the bathroom later to compose myself. I couldn't go back in as I was too shaken up, so Nicole stayed with me while Alex got the professor. I told her what happened and she didn't seem to really care, but said she'd switch group members. Afterwards I saw her talking one on one with Amelia.Later on, I was discussing something with class and Nicole heard Amelia say to another student, don't try to tell her (me) if you think differently, she'll just run away and cry about it. I went to the professor again and told her what Amelia said and again they had a one on one convo. After that there was no problem.But since coming home and sharing stories about college, my parents are divided on how I handled things.

Both of us are now no longer practicing but our parents and majority of the extended family are still devout Christians. This explains why Julian married his now Ex wife, Nora (27F) when they were 19 especially since she was also a very conservative Christian woman. Needless to say it was mostly due to both of their  parents pressure for them to marry at such a young age. They ended about 2 years ago and left on good terms. They both work at the same company but the office is quite large and they work in different departments so it’s not a problem.About a month ago, Julian confessed that he was bi and had known since he was 14. Apparently he experimented in high school secretly but was too scared to let anyone know. He said he was going through a lot at the time and could not handle the stress of figuring out himself and so he just repressed it and basically gaslit himself into thinking he was straight. It wasn’t until recently that he met someone (his now bf) that he finally took the time to work through his identity and be happy with himself.I love my brother no matter what and will always be there for him and this does not change anything between us. Our family taking this news badly was to be expected but apparently our parents let it spill to Nora’s parents (they are still friends btw) and she found out from there. She reacted horribly. She said she felt violated and disgusted that a “sinner” and “homosexual” had been intimate with her and that if she had know they would never have been married. She ended up outing him to her co-workers and in about 24h the entire office knew.This past weekend, Julian called me crying about this issue and looked to vent about it. I let him know that she was 100% wrong for outing her but I thought that even though what she said about him was unkind she had a right to feel that way. Julian was upset by this, hung up saying “thought out of everyone in the family you would be the one to stand by me” and hasn’t spoken to me since.

I've bought a pack of juul which I'm not finished with yet last week.Two nights ago, I discussed with my therapist how guilty I felt about lying to my husband but he's told me repeatedly that if I start up again he'll divorce me. I want to quit and I am, but it's a process to undo a habit of over 10+ years. I even took new medication to help with nicotine withdrawal and it's been helping. I went from smoking four juuls a day to barely one juul every 2 days.Today, he found my juul in the car and stormed out - I know I shouldn't have lied to him but I felt like I had no choice. He doesn't understand why I can't quit cold turkey like he can/did. It's not even about the nicotine anymore - it's about the habit of having something and puffing on it.I feel so alone - he's gone and probably won't be back until late and think it's the end of our marriage.I never felt like I could be honest about it - he’s said multiple times that if I start again he’ll divorce me and even said it as he was walking out.Am I the asshole for lying to him about fully quitting when we got back from our honeymoon?Post edit: We had tried to quit three other times and he had successfully quit each time: he had quit cold turkey those times only to start again when I brought back into the house and restarted. He pushed for those times, but this time he said I will quit when you decide to and I decided to quit before the honeymoon. He has self control problems but the way he controls it is not have access, he is angry because he went through hell like withdrawals with me for quitting just for me to secretly start again. He has also quit things very important to him for our relationship (his life long hobby of motorcycling) and says I should do the same.",

The quality of their presentations and the depth of their critiques impressed me. The openness of the environment made me feel comfortable to express my thoughts fully.A student started speaking about their family struggles, touching on issues such as divorce, fights, and trust. Given the environment's open nature, I felt compelled to comment first after her presentation. However, my words were poorly chosen. I blurted out, \"Wow, I'm going to say this. Your family is FUCKED UP.\"The room fell into a stunned silence, punctuated by gasps. The student responded with an \"understandingly disappointed\" expression. Immediately regretful, I apologized for my inappropriate language. I asked, \"Oh! can i say that? is that language allowed?\"The rest of the class was awkward, and I was embarrassed.

	"body" : "Hey all, first time poster, long time lurker. I'm in a bit of a pickle and could use some outside perspective. So, the issue revolves around me, my odd snack habit, and a labeled bag of Cheetos Puffs.I'll start by admitting I have a unique way of enjoying my Cheetos Puffs. They're 100% my favorite snack food. It might seem strange to some, but I've been doing this for years and it's simply how I like them best. I like to suck on them until they get soft and then I spit them back into a bag. I've done this since I was a kid and despite the looks I get, it's my own little comfort ritual. I understand it may seem gross to some, but I want to emphasize that I ALWAYS keep my soggy Cheetos separate from other snacks in the house.I use a particular bag clearly labeled \"Mama's Bag\" in bold, large letters. This bag stays in the pantry, separate from the rest of the food, so as not to confuse or upset anyone. My boys and hubby know to stay away from this bag as it's mine.The incident happened yesterday when my brother in law, who's been staying with us for 3 weeks now, decided to dig into my labeled bag without asking me first. He was horrified when he dipped his hand in only to find soggy, sucked-down cheetos.. He immediately spit it out, and came storming into my room, accusing me of ruining his appetite and demanding that I throw away my 'disgusting' bag. He called me an asshole for keeping such a 'gross' bag in the kitchen where anyone could stumble upon it.Now, I get that expecting some cheetohs puffs and getting a soggy, sucked down cheetoh is disappointing, especially if you're not expecting it. However, I feel that my bag was clearly labeled and separated for a reason. It's my personal snack and I never implied or suggested that anyone else should eat from it. I've been doing this for years and no one has ever had an issue with it save for my husband, once, who quickly got over it.I apologized for his unpleasant experience, but refused to throw away my personal stash. He remains upset with me and maintains that I am an asshole.So, Reddit, AITA for keeping my personal, soggy Cheetos in a clearly labeled bag in the pantry?",

My boyfriend is the perfect man he’s tall, sweet and very supportive of me the only problem I have is with his sister (15F) let’s call her Alexa. so for a bit of backstory my boyfriend practically raised Alexa since their mom was an addict and wasn’t around and their dad worked overseas. They are very close and don’t  have a typical “brother-sister” relationship.the problem with their relationship is that my boyfriend is very loving and affectionate with Alexa (which is fine) but what makes me uncomfortable is how touchy they are with each other like every time we go out together she’s always holding onto his sleeve or arm they’re also always cuddling when we watch movies or are just hanging out on the couch which can get annoying because I sometimes just want him all to myself but can’t because of Alexa. I also hate the nicknames he calls her some of them include baby, sweetheart, princess, honey, and “my special girl” in my opinion these nicknames are very inappropriate for a brother to call his little sister and he should be calling me that not her. when I brought it up and told him how I felt he looked a little annoyed but nonetheless told me he‘ll hold back with the nicknames and affection which he did but only for a bit.I also have a problem with Alexa and that’s because of how clingy and dependent she is with him. Anytime she has the slightest problem she always has to call and ask him for help even for the simplest things like “how to change a tire” or “how to make a doctors appointment” she even interrupted one of are dates to ask him “How to Pay the internet bill online” it gets super annoying because she can literally just google how to do it or ask someone else (they have other siblings) but she Just has to ask my boyfriend what’s even more annoying is how my he literally drops everything to answer her calls even when he knows it’s probably something dumb. When I tried bringing this up my boyfriend just said she’s a kid and needs a little help which I can agree with to a certain extent but Alexa is a very smart girl and can figure this stuff on her own when I told him this he got really upset and kinda yelled that he doesn’t want her to struggle and “figure it out on her own” like he did. He got quite after this and went to his room to think, I understand why he feels like this but I really think that if Alexa figured things out on her own it will be very beneficial for her He just won’t hear me out.Anyways this all happened a couple days ago and he still won’t talk to me properly so AITA?Edit: Ok I get it I’m TA I’ve been thinking and decided that I need to apologize to my boyfriend and Alexa thanks to everyone who gave actual advice but to everyone else that is just being plain rude and disrespectful and saying that you hopes he breaks up with me shame on you, seriously none of you know anything about our relationship and what we’ve been through together so honestly just fuck off.But anyways I wanted to clear some things upI am not jealous of Alexa all of this was truly me being uncomfortable with their relationship because to me it was weird and unnatural for siblings to act that way with each other maybe it was the way I grew up but me and my siblings barely talked or acknowledged each other despite being close in age.2.I think most of you ignored when I said they have other siblings  that’s why I was annoyed that Alexa only came to my boyfriend for help when she can ask any of their other siblings3.my boyfriend does not have custody of Alexa and is not living in his childhood home with her and their sibling anymore4.for anyone that was concerned about the questions Alexa was asking my boyfriend shes fine and does not pay for the internet with her own money she’s just in charge of making the payment. She also doesn’t take herself to the doctors she just makes the appointment and either my boyfriend or one of their siblings takes her. She also knows how to drive and has a permit.

It was my fault, I suppose, I had a fling with a coworker and when it came to light at work, my husband found out and immidietly filed for divorce. We had three kids and the divorce was not pretty. We have joint custody. I got alimony and child support and we split everything we had evenly. Except the house. Since he inherited the house before marriage, he kept it. The way my lawyer explained it to me, he had a direct deposit going into a separate account which was used to pay for property taxes, insurance and any expenses that came up. We tried to get the house, even offered to go lower on the alimony. His words to me were, I'm not giving you the house so you can fuck other dudes in it.Since then, he doesn't talk to me unless it's something about the kids. He doesn't contribute anything to the kids expenses. I had to get a different job and the money I make and the alimony/child support all goes to the kids. He refuses to buy them clothes, school supplies or any activities. He convinced them that he gives their money to me and anything they need, they have to ask me. Even worse, he buys them nice stuff, but only to keep it at his house. They still have their old rooms and they all have nice clothes in the closet, Xbox and toys to play with. My daughters room is now her princess room, with dolls, dresses and anything she wants in there. They can't bring any of this stuff home, it's only for when they're at Sam's. That's why he kept the house, to use it to turn the kids against me. They treat going to stay with dad like a vacation.He bought a boat and takes them out on the lake whenever he can. He made a snarky, now you're not wasting my money, I can afford stuff to me. He started dating some FOB Mexican girl. She's like 15 years younger than him. Like completely taking advantage of this poor girl. But my kids love her. She started teaching them Spanish. They started using Spanish words to refer to things around the house. To clarify, I don't have a problem with her, I just feel like Sam is trying to replace me with her in the eyes of my kids.Last month, they told me they want to live with daddy. All the time. I cried all night after that. I was a mess for a week, couldn't focus on anything. He gets to play this fun dad while he's with them, spoil them and makes me do the actual parenting. I said no, of course, and the kids have been mad at me. Sam didn't argue with me, he just said I knew you'd say no out of spite. Then just left and ignore my texts.

They seem to be very codependent on each other, Nowell seems to find it sweet but I think it's unhealthy and I've started putting up boundaries between them.Due to their bad behaviour being influenced by one another, they no longer can text each other at school, nor can they both go out at the same time.

	"title" : "AITA for not letting my son talk to his friends",
	"body" : "Me (44M) and my wife have a 16 year old son. To be completely honest, I have always been super strict with technology.5 years ago I put a downtime on his phone and macbook, which to those who don't know, essentially is a screen time and turns his phone and laptop off at a certain time. This includes him not being able to text or call his friends during the night. My wife has always disagreed with thisOriginally his downtime was 7 PM, but we eventually upped it to 9 PM once he got into high school. He's been irritated by this.He doesn't care about the fact he can't access apps during his downtime, but more annoyed that he can't keep communicating with his friends, which annoys him even more when it's summer. We also moved states 2 months ago which has lead him to try and talk to his friends from home more often.However, he does have a playstation downstairs which we let him get on, even when his phone and computer are off (I have tried to put a downtime on his playstation before too but I couldn't figure out how).4 days ago he placed an order on amazon, and 2 days later the package came. I was already on the couch when my son got it from the front door and brought it to the kitchen where he opened it. He pulled out a box of earbuds. He already has Airpods, so I asked him what he needed those for. He told me it was for his playstation, so I thought nothing of it.Later that night, I got woken up at 11 by the sound of laughing coming from the living room, followed by the faint sound of talking. At first I didn't know what it was, but as I became less drowsy, I realized it was my son.I went downstairs and saw him sitting on the couch with the earbuds on, on the playstation. He saw me and said 'hold on' into the mic before taking the earbuds off.I asked him what he was doing and he said he was playing games with his friends. I looked at the screen and saw him in some kind of voice chat with 2 other people. I told him he wasn't allowed to talk to his friends after 9 which is why the downtime exists and he told me he thought he was still able to call them on his playstation since I let him use it at night.He knows the rules I have in place for technology, and I felt like my rules were getting broken so I told him to get off the playstation and go up to bed. He groaned and said 'oh my god bro' before shutting the console off. I watched him go up the stairs, making sure he didn't try to stay down.The next day, to ensure this wouldn't happen again, I took his earbuds and put them in a closet in me and my wife's room in a place our son wouldn't find them. I also went on his playstation and figured out how to disable joining party chats.When he found out, he started giving me an attitude about how annoying I'm being. My wife thinks I'm taking it too far and being an asshole and some close family members think I'm potentially damaging his relationship with his friends. However, I think I'm doing him good.What do you guys think? Am I the asshole?",

	"body" : "I went to the Philippines in April to marry my wife. She worked in a Japanese style hostess club that according to their social media, was aimed at Japanese visitors to Manila.She got promoted to the office, and she was miserable bc the owners wife was well, jealous. Calling her names. She called me crying one night and we discussed her quitting. This went on for over a week. She considered going back home to Davao City or staying a dorm like room in Manila searching for a new job. We priced things out.Then she stopped complaining this week. She said everything was okay. On Friday, she sends me a pics of her and a female bartender smiling and having fun. She followed that up with a video of about 30 shirtless men dancing on and around a stage. A second video showed her and the bartender dancing having fun.I asked where she was and she said that the owner decided to cater to single filipino women instead of Japanese business men and they were getting prepared for the grand opening.I told her I was upset that she didn't tell me this until now. I said what about you quitting. She said she didn't want to now. I asked if she was still being harassed by the owner's wife and she said yes, but it was okay now.So last night, I told her I wanted her to quit still because she was still being mistreated by the wife. She said it would cost (literally) 10x the cost to support her than what we had already discussed and researched. Which got me mad, because she was clearly lying. So I told her let's video chat. She said she was in a staff meeting 4 hours before her shift, and 4 hours before they opened. I said tell them you need to pee or something and just call me. She wouldn't for over half an hour. At that point, I told her to choose me or her job at which point she called me, and promised to quit on her pay day.I would have considered not telling her to quit, but her behavior after I found out, the fact she was brought to tears at least once and now is okay. The fact she lied about prices we had discussed, and I will make her quit. Am I the asshole here? Or because she likes the young shirtless men more than her being harassed, clearly lying about things we discussed, and refusing to excuse herself to talk to me warrant my suspension and wanting to make her quit?",

He prays and everything and while I can privately admit I find the ritual a tiny bit silly, I’d never tell him that or ask him not to.He’s fasting, and it’s honestly frustrating enough to me that we’re supposed to go a full month without getting lunch or dinner, or kissing, or being intimate. I’m throwing a barbecue lunch party for work in a few days, and it’s my first social outing with this group of people, even my boss is going to be in attendance. The food will be served around 5 or 5:30, but the thing is, my BF fasts until like 8. I was worried it’ll reflect poorly on me if he doesn’t eat with the rest of us, so I asked him if he could fast for the day but kind of end it early so he could still eat with us.When I asked he said he couldn’t, because then the whole day wouldn’t count, but that he’d still be at the lunch and he just wouldn’t eat. I tried to explain again that it would make me look bad, but he shrugged and said if my boss and coworkers had an issue with his faith that was a reflection on them, not me or him. I really don’t feel like it’s a big deal for him to end a few hours early when compared with a whole month of this stuff, and it really feels to me like he’s ignoring what I want in favor of what he wants. Not only that but he’s risking my image and relationships at work over a few hours’ worth of fasting. AITA for that?Edit: Okay, I get it, I’m an asshole, or the worst person in the world, or whatever. Can you stop messaging me death threats now?",

I always got yelled at for everything as a kid, especially when it came to her. She was really sensitive when she moved in with us (having lived with my aunt and uncle until she was 6 due to my parents not being able to support two kids) and cried at nearly everything. Got her the wrong snack? Cried and told dad. Putting one cube to much ice in her water? Cried and told dad. I hold a bit of a grudge cus I feel like I had to grow up too fast because of her. Things have gotten better as we grew up, both parents apologizing to me for everything and her toughening up, but we still don’t enjoy each other.On to the story, Zo has had a ‘friend,’ Elle (16F), come over to our house (I still live with my parents) a lot recently. Elle and Zo have hung out at least a dozen times in the past month and slept over 3 times, the most recent (unknown to me at the time) being last night at our house.(Zo’s school got cancelled for today and yesterday due to electrical issues)So, imagine my suprise when I came into Zo’s room (not knocking) this morning to ask if she wanted eggs and found two figures sleeping in her bed.I quickly assume she snuck a boy in. I know I really should’ve known better but Elle has a very boyish frame and haircut and usually they sleep seperatly at sleepovers. They also were in an intimate position, cuddling in a nonplatonic way. I was able to get out before either awoke.Here’s where I admit I did a AH move. After a bit, I woke up my mom and told her Zo had snuck a boy in. My mom, forgetting Elle slept over, bursts into my sister’s room, and we both walk in on something we weren’t meant to see.Zo and Elle locking lips.They break away when we walk in but I know that both me and mom already saw it. I’ll clarify that both fully clothed and the kiss was chaste. I don’t care whether anyone likes anyone, but I know for a fact my mother does. Mom tells Elle to head home, which Zo makes her do. Then the fun began.My mom and later dad yell at Zo for /hours/. I know a better person would have helped but a part of me saw it as revenge for years of being scolded because of her.My parents go out to cool down and I apologize to Zo for not knocking. She doesn’t respond.So I jokingly say, “Not the little golden child anymore.”She says that I’m a bad brother and a mistake, which escalates to a little argument when I tell her that I had it worse and to toughen up. We exchanged some harsh words before she kicks me out of her room. She’s currently at my aunt and uncle’s while my parents figure out what to do.My parents think I did the right thing, but I talked to my gf and couple of my friends about this and most of my friends agree that my only AH move was not knocking, but my gf says that I’m a huge AH for how I talked to Zo afterwards.So Reddit, AITA?",

	"body" : "I’m 34, she’s 24, kids are 15&13F.So the story is basically the title. My sister has been an amazing help with my kids since they were born. I still lived at home and she took on her auntie role proudly, after I moved out she still babysat just about every weekend which was amazing, childcare can be so expensive and hard to find I was lucky to have her for free on demand!I don’t work due to anxiety so I get state assistance for housing and food for me and my girls. Their father is finally out of the picture but he was always pretty useless anyways. My sister was always a second parent to my girls. She’s always been there for them and always helps us out with necessities I can’t provide like clothes and school supplies.This argument actually pretty much started over school supplies as I was simply asking when we would be going shopping for them since they are going back to school this year after an atrocious year doing remote learning (I also asked for her help with this and she dropped the ball so bad one of the girls had to do summer school and the other failed completely). Her response to me was that she’s “done supporting us” and that I needed to figure it out myself?? I called her a selfish Bitch and now her and my mother won’t talk to me.To me this came out of no where. She did lose her job after the retail store she worked at closed last year but I checked her bank statements and unemployment was actually paying her more than her job, she’s also been at a new job since March so I know money isn’t an issue. I think maybe her boyfriend finally got to her, he’s taken a lot of the time she would normally spend with the girls away and he never really liked them claiming it’s because they’re “rude” to him and demanding of my sister, I think he’s just selfish.Either way, am I the wrong one here? I guess maybe I shouldn’t have yelled at her but I really think it is selfish of her to just stop helping out all of a sudden like we haven’t depended on her for years.",

	"body" : "For Christmas this year, my dad gave me a yearly subscription to my local newspaper.  This is an award-winning publication, and it often features really interesting stories that I hadn't read because they were behind a paywall.  I was very pleased to have received the gift.  The thing is, I work full-time and need to start my day early, so I don't really have the time to read the paper deeply during the work week.  It's on Saturdays and Sundays that I can dedicate as much time as I want to it.Well, earlier this morning, my wife and I were sitting in our living room, and she was in the mood to talk over our morning coffee.  Normally, this is fine, though she does tend to ramble on and on about stuff I don't always care about, but today it was getting pretty annoying.  Furthermore, she seemed oblivious that my one or two-word answers to her questions meant that I was trying to read and didn't really want to talk in that moment.  Finally, during one of her interruptions, I turned to her and said \"Can't you see that I'm trying to read the paper?\"She became offended and sort of got a surprised look on her face, but that quickly turned to anger.  She tried to guilt-trip me and tell me that \"we never catch up anymore,\" but I reminded her that I am home every night after work, even though some days I work late/get caught in traffic.  At one time, I worked a job that required extensive travel, where I would be gone for weeks at a time, so I don't think she has any room to complain about my current work situation.  Nonetheless, she wanted to make this difficult by refusing to let me read.At this point, my wife is still upset with me, and I don't know what to do.  I'm considering locking myself in an empty room for a few hours because this seems to be the only way she won't disturb me, but even then I could see how she would knock on the door every 10-15 minutes.  I just need her to understand that what she's doing is making my Christmas gift essentially worthless, but she doesn't seem to have any respect for my father's money at all.

I hired her part time and she worked after school on weekdays and for several hours on the weekends. She has been good help stocking the shelves and cleaning among other things though not as quickly as other employees. I've noticed her slacking off several times. While she's working, she often talks with my son when he comes up to her which distracts both of them. I've told her numerous times that work should be spent working silently but she doesn't listen. I told her that she's lucky I allow them to talk during lunch breaks (she works 9am-2pm on weekends so she has them then) and that I allow her to have lunch breaks at all.

I told her that good  physical appearance is very important in marriage. I explained to her the difference between marriage and friendship. I told her that in friendship, there is no hard expectations. There is no expectations to be physically attractive and in perfect health and shape. There is no expectations to perform. You can just be yourself and be comfortable but in marriage, you have to step your games up if you want your spouse to be attracted to you. She argued with me saying that love should be unconditional but I hit her with the truth again. I told her that in marriage, there is no such a thing as unconditional love. I told her that love in marriage is not real and should not expect her husband to be attracted to her if she is fat. Her husband is making hard efforts to stay in perfect shape for her and she should do the same if she wants to be married and if she is not ready to make efforts, she is not ready for marriage. She yelled at me saying that I'm very shallow and that no one can be perfect all the time but I argued with her saying that this is what she has to do. She must be perfect for her hubby.

I'm concerned about the validity of this relationship because high school relationships rarely last. They are practice for the future. I wanted to properly set expectations so she's not disappointed when he inevitably breaks up with her for someone better, prettier, older, etc. Unlike my son, who is 15, my daughter doesn't put much effort into her appearance, she doesn't care about makeup and clothes and wants to wear the same rags to school every day. After her date she came home overly excited and all she could talk about was Sam.  I told her that quite frankly I'm surprised this he wanted to go out with her and I question his motives. She asked me why I would say that and I was honest with her, most boys at her age are immature and aren't really looking for anything long term, they just want to take advantage or are going through a phase or are answering a \"dare\" from a friend to date the nerd, etc.She blew up at me after that and accused me of calling her a nerd and saying that I think she's ugly and not worthy of a boyfriend. I told her that's nonsense, that's not what I meant. I said I'm just trying to set expectations, not to expect much at her age, I don't want her to be disappointed and come crying to me about how this boy broke up with her. And then I told her I don't think she is ugly but she could put some more effort into her appearance if she wants to keep boys in general, this will help her in her life beyond high school. I said look at her brother, he keeps up with trends, grooms himself well, and I think he's well on the road to success. She can't get by with just wearing sweatshirts and jackets all the time with that one pair of torn-up jeans.

Otherwise get left behind. That is what happened to me, my ex left me when my kids were too young to remember.She said he was happy on the date and seemed like he really liked her. I said that's how it always is now but eventually he's going to get tired of her. I've seen the girls at their school when I pick my kids up every day and my daughter has a lot of work to make herself more presentable. I then said if I were a boy, I would not pick her based on the way she was dressed unless I was dared to do so.She accused me of trying to ruin her life, ruin her happiness, etc. I said that's not true I'm trying to prevent what happened to me from happening to her, but she wouldn't listen and now she's not talking to me. I wish my mother would have told me this. It's tough love. AITA? Was I too harsh? Her brother thinks so and so does my friend but I want more opinions.",

	"body" : "I (f25) started a new job a few weeks ago and last weekend I was invited to join some of my coworkers in a pub for a birthday celebration. Many people brought their spouses and partners and it was generally very pleasant.Except for one thing. Sarah, one of my coworkers. She looks like she could be in her early 20s but she’s in her early 30s, she’s tall and thin but has got baby face going on which makes her look a lot younger than she already is. I assumed she was my age or younger until I found out her age on the night out.She brought her boyfriend with her who genuinely looked like he could be in his late 40s, long beard, tall and muscly and fat at the same time (like imagine really tones arms and back but huge belly kind of thing). He looked like he could be her father.After a few drinks, I’ve noticed she’s been getting tipsy and he’s been way too protective of her.When she went to the toilet, I followed her and asked if she’s okay and if she needed any help.She replied that she was fine. I tried to gently steer the conversation on her relationship and told her it’s really creepy how some guys go after younger women and she agreed that I’s creepy sometimes. And I mention how her boyfriend looks like her dad and it seems like he might be controlling her.She looked at me like I had two heads and asked what the hell did I mean by that. So I opened up and told her that he’s old and someone so young and inexperienced as her is in danger of being manipulated and getting into a toxic relationship and I said that if she needed help getting out, I was there for her.She told me I was being presumptuous and to leave her alone. I said that I understand that it’s difficult to see the age difference as wrong but it truly is.Honestly, I didn’t expect that but she was fucking rude after that. She told me to mind my own fucking business and told me her boyfriend is the same age as her and she won’t be taking relationship advice from someone she met a week ago (she was on annual leave until then).I told her I didn’t believe her and it’s okay to be defensive when faced with reality but she should know I am there for her regardless. She said ‘fuck off weirdo’ and stormed out of the bathroom. She whispered something to her boyfriend and they laughed and she did the same to one of her work friends.I’ve tried talking to her at work but she told me she didn’t talk with assholes and I should stop assuming things and accuse people of being creepy without knowing anything.I kind of feel bad but I have had good intentions and wish she’s see it. It’s not like I could’ve known they were the same age, they look like they’re 20 years apart. I still think it’s creepy he went for someone looking so young though. I am wondering if I should apologise. Was I the asshole?",

I personally take my job seriously and actually put in effort.He on the other hand acts really slow. It takes him 3x longer than it does me to read and comprehend food tickets. He'll go up to a table and have to think for over 10 seconds about which seat number to take a plate to. You look at the damn ticket, look at the number and put the plate at that seat number. It's extremely annoying to take work seriously and have some slow idiot slow you down because they don't have the ability to do simple shit such as reading numbers. It's like his mind leaves him. It takes him so so so so so much longer to think about simple shit as it does a normal person like myself. It's one thing if it's a difficult task. But when you have a simple task such as reading a number I'm sorry but that's just pathetic. I finally get fed up after a week and tell him to follow me to the back and I let him have it. I tell him he needs to grow up and stop being so goddamn slow. Pick up the pace and stop wasting everyone's time. We're trying to do a job and if he's not gonna take it seriously then he needs to go work at a McDonald's or something where they don't have any expectations.

	"body" : "Disclaimer, English is my second language, so I’m sorry for my bad grammar.A little context: My sister and her husband are living in different countries. Her husband is in the USA and she is in the same country as me (our home country). They recently had a child, while my sister was in the US, then she moved back to our home country and refuses to live with her husband in US (this is a story of its own). Her husband is covering every financial aspect of her life, so she doesn’t need to work.The story: Few months ago my sister had a baby, a wonderful little angel. At first everything seemed to be ok, she was a good mother and was taking a good care of the baby.First thing she did that was a bit alarming for me, is that she hired a babysitter. I was a bit confused/worried about this, because my sister doesn’t have a job or any other thing to do rather than taking care of her baby and enjoying the precious time she got with her. So I thought she might be having some post-pregnancy issues and she needs a little help.But then, she started taking driving lessons and was planning to get a driver’s license. Later she told me, that she is planning to buy a car, and to my question of why she even need a car she answered that it’ll be more convenient to go to places with a baby with her own car rather on a taxi. Please take into account, that she basically hasn’t got any place to go, this isn’t out of sheer necessity.So I told her, that it’s irresponsible from her side to put her baby in dangerous situations (traffic is really bad her) without a valid reason. And when the argument heated up I told her that it’s not ok to not care for your own child’s safety and at an instant she put her child in the car, I’ll call the child protection services on her and will make sure that they investigate wether she is mentally capable of taking care of the baby. She knows that I wasn’t joking, as I’m not impulsive person and don’t talk out of emotions.We haven’t talked since, and I don’t really feel bad for what I’ve said, but I’m thinking maybe I’m overreacting?Edit: I see a lot of comments saying that I’m the asshole, and I agree that it very well might be true. I just want to add that my country is in top 3 of road accidents mortality in the world , and driving a car here is a REAL danger.Also this was actually the first time I ever had such serious argument with my sister, just because I found that decision incredibly irresponsible.",

We spend a lot of time at each other’s places.This weekend he was staying over at my place and everything seemed normal. Yesterday evening, after he had left, my roommate approached me and told me she didn’t want him to come over anymore. When I asked her why she just said that she didn’t like him. That kind of surprised me because up until then they’ve always gotten along.I asked if anything happened or if she had a reason why she suddenly didn’t like him but she said no. I’m aware that he’s a bit older than the other guys I’ve dated before but a very sweet and funny person. We fit together great and he’s been trying very hard to get her to like him as well.I think without a concrete reason I shouldn’t have to stop inviting him over and it’s unfair of her to ask that of me.Edit: she knows that I would choose her over him if something had happened between them to make her uncomfortable. I'll ask her again but she can be stubborn if she wants to.UPDATE: After talking to her for over half an hour she finally admitted to what was going on. Turns out one of her friends from school was recently arrested by my boyfriend. The guy apparently recognized him and told her about it. She had a few pictures of the 3 of us on her instagram account which is probably where he saw it. She was embarrassed about it and has taken the pictures down.I asked her again if anything else had happened but she denied it. She admitted that she didn't actually dislike my boyfriend but that her friends were just teasing her about me dating a copMy boyfriend is also 39 but that's not really relevant to this situation.Some of you seem really bored. Maybe you should pick up a hobby instead of fantasizing about strangers lives.

	"title" : "AITA for wanting my husband to skip a concert and visit my family instead?",
	"body" : "I (41f) and my husband (45m) have been together for 14 years.  In that time, my father has come to visit us once and has never seen our new home.  I try to visit him once or twice a year but due to him having a farm and animals, it’s difficult for him to make the 2.5 hour trip to the city where I live.  He recently retired and is finally able to stay a night away so he reached out and wants to come see us next weekend.  My husband’s reaction was to immediately get frustrated because that night won’t work for him because he bought concert tickets ‘for us’ six months ago.  Keep in mind, I don’t even like the band and the tickets were inexpensive.  He suggested that he just find someone else to take and go to the concert anyway.  I got upset, saying that it hurts my feelings that he wouldn’t even consider missing the show and that my dad has only come up once in 17 years and it’s a big deal to me. Keep in mind, the last time I made the journey to visit my father, husband stayed home.  He often stays home when I visit my family, even though his mom lives in our neighborhood so we see her often.  He said that was between my dad and I.  I started crying just thinking about having to explain to my dad that my husband wouldn’t be joining us because he was choosing to go to a show instead.  It feels rude and awkward, and like a display of how little my partner cares about my family.  I said he is being selfish and he said that I am being selfish.  So, who is right?  AITA for wanting my husband to forego the concert to spend time with my dad?Update:  Husband agreed he should miss the show, knowing how important this visit is for me.  I insisted he go ahead with his plans.  He took two days off this week to finish painting and working on our home in anticipation of Dad's visit, which I appreciate so much. Dad will arrive tomorrow at noon.  We will probably play some chess, show him around our home and then get him checked into a suite at the hotel where I work before going out to dinner together before husband departs for the show.  He will check out a friend's brewery in the and then third wheel with a couple he's known since high school and doesn't ever see. I can recognize that my intense emotions about my dad finally visiting clouded my ability to see things from husband's point of view.  Husband was very able to see my point of view, and was thus willing to give up an evening of entertainment in order to support me during a highly emotional and important time, if needed.  98% of Redditors made the focus my dad being an absent parent and not about me being a person with an absent father needing support from their partner.  I disagree that I am 'the asshole' for having needs, and I'm thankful that my partner is more understanding than random strangers, who I will never again ask for opinions.  Lesson learned.",

She also consumes like 3/4 of everyone's food and it's fucking annoying to be honest, especially since I don't think my parents have the money to buy SO. MUCH.

Double her daily calories. And also mentioned our parents finances. She started getting REALLY fucking mad and told me to mind my own business and that I eat a lot too. So I told her I'm almost a full foot taller than her and also play rugby and lift, she does nothing but snack and watch TV. She told me to fuck off and called me a 'self obsessed little cunt'. I said I don't give a shit then and told her to enjoy heart disease.I think I can hear her crying, but she cries 24/7 over nothing, so it's kinda hard to feel bad to be honest.

	"body" : "My(43F) boyfriend(32M) and I have been together for about six years. There has always been issues around him going out with friends and drinking too much while he’s out. He’s not abusive, he’s just your run of the mill annoying drunk, occasionally accompanied by puking, passing out, or just being contentious. He doesn’t do it very often, but it always ends in the same old story, to the point of me dreading him ever wanting to go hang out with friends when alcohol will be involved.Last week he let me know he had plans with friends for Friday evening directly after work (gets off at 3:00), as I had plans for my teenager and I to spend the evening (alcohol free) with my mom. Supposedly it was something his boss wanted to do, not in relation to bf’s birthday. He told me he planned to only have a couple beers and then head home to relax until I got home and then we’d enjoy some adult beverages together. His birthday was the upcoming Sunday after his outing on Friday so we planned to celebrate it with drinks on Friday night instead of Sunday since I had to work Monday morning, and then just enjoy a nice dinner out somewhere Sunday evening.Knowing how past occasions have been, I literally begged him to please drink responsibly while out with his friends so we could enjoy our time together and not get into an argument and ruin the weekend. He promised that this time would be different and he’d probably head home around 5:30-6:00.Fast forward to Friday around 6:30 and I still hadn’t heard from him (he usually lets me know when he’s heading home), 7:00 still nothing. I finally call around 7:30 (still out with my mom) with a sinking feeling in my stomach because I’m fairly certain I already know the outcome. Sure enough, he answers the phone with the most slurred “hey baby girl” that it was almost unintelligible. My first thought was that he was playing a joke because there was just no way this was happening again. He wasn’t. I immediately just hung up the phone and my teenager could visibly see how upset and disappointed I was. We continued the evening with gma before heading home around 8:30.When we walked into the house, there he was snoring and passed out on the couch. I didn’t even try to wake him, I just left him alone and went about my night. The next morning’s conversation/argument informed me that “I only had 3 tall beers and a shot” and “I wasn’t drunk, I was just tired and fell asleep”. We didn’t say much else to each other Saturday, so when Sunday rolled around I just treated it as any other day, we did absolutely nothing to celebrate his birthday.Now I’m the bad person for ignoring him on his birthday and hurting his feelings for not spending time with him.Am I overreacting??EditSorry. I’m new to Reddit and wasn’t trying to post in all caps for any particular reason. I would fix it if I knew how.Everyone’s amounts are different, but to me a couple beers is exactly that…. a couple 12oz bottles of average beer. Not almost double the size, tall, higher alcohol content ipa’s and then liquor.I should have clarified that yes, he was driving, which has been one of the main reasons for this ongoing argument every time this happens. I feel like he should have more respect for myself and my teenager than to put himself in a position of unintentionally removing himself from our lives by either killing himself in a dui or spending his life in prison for crashing and hurting someone else.",

She’s shared her steam library with me since high school.We were both really excited about the release of Baldur’s gate III. She had already bought the game before release so I believe she spent most of Thursday playing it when it came out, as well as Friday after work and most of Saturday.Now here’s the thing though, unlike Charlotte I really don’t like spending money. She also has a better paying job than me. So I figured I just use library share to play the game. Now, I only started playing the game on Sunday because I knew she was going to be going to a musical, so she’d be away most of the day, and I’d be able to play unbothered. I had a blast! Me and my boyfriend (m27) set up a game together, and we’ve been playing as much as we can.I had a really shitty day at work yesterday and I noticed Charlotte was playing the game. With how Steam’s library share works, that means I couldn’t play myself. I explained my situation to her and asked if she would mind not playing. She agreed, which I thought was very nice.I figured I get a little time in today as well, as Charlotte usually works until 7 pm, but all of a sudden she started playing at 4 30 already. I figured it couldn’t hurt to ask her if she could stop playing until like 10 pm. She replied with ‘’OK.’’ And quit the game.Now I thought everything was fine and all, but all of a sudden I got a bunch of texts from our mutual friend Hugo (m25). Apparently he and Charlotte were in a call when I texted her and she complained to him about the fact that I was making demands of her playtime.I told him I wasn’t demanding anything, I was just asking, and that she could always say no if she didn’t want to stop playing?? It’s not my fault she wasn’t honest about the fact that she was annoyed by my request??Anyway I can’t reach Charlotte to confirm and Hugo is being an ass to me.AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for holding up traffic to help strangers?",
	"body" : "This happened about a month ago on a very frigid February morning.My daily commute has me leaving an apartment complex with a left turn onto a main roadway. The speed limit in the area is 30 mph (50 km/hr) and the roadwa has one of those center-turn lanes.One morning, looking towards the left to determine when I could properly turn onto the roadway, I saw what appeared to be a mother and a very young daughter, posssibly close to age four. They darted across the same roadway, not in the safest place (no cross walk). But I'm not one to judge due to how far away the nearest striped cross walks happen to be relative to their location, and one would be a backtrack.Before I could turn left myself, I saw them nearly sprinting in the same direction I would be heading. I did have a bit of wait due to traffic.As I eased into the roadway, I realized that there was a bus stop maybe a furlong or so (about 200 metres) down the roadway. I eased into my travel lane and noted an Express Bus behind me that would stop there. I reasoned that the two were desperately trying to get to the stop in time to catch that bus. The young girl had to stop running every now and then due to her youth.I then decided to help them the best I could, and slowed to about 15 mph (25 km/hr) which again was half the speed limit. There wasn't much traffic so the bus could have easily passed the stop if they weren't there, but by intentionally driving slowly, the two were close enough to the stop for the bus to stop for them.I did have one driver behind me beep his horn at me  and there may have been one more vehicle between me and the bus. But as soon as I got past the intersection for the stop, I assumed my typical rate of speed, that being 35 mph (58 km/hr). Yes that's about 30/50, but I wasn't going to hold anyone up any further. I feel that speed traps won't stop for only five/eight over. I hadn't traveleed more than 2/10 of a miel (325 metres), before assuming \"traffic\" speed.Was I an asshole to the unknown number of vehicles ultimately slowed down/delayed by my action?",

	"body" : "We’re all 19. I have a friend, let's call her Guava, who I've been close with since I was a kid. We've had our ups and downs in our friendship, but currently, we're not as close. Still friends, though.Last year, Guava introduced me to her then-boyfriend, who we'll call Cigar. After Guava and Cigar broke up, Cigar and I became very close and he's now my best friend. Guava has been acting rather childish regarding her breakup, and is also upset that me and Cigar have grown close in just a few months when I've known her for years. Cigar has handled the breakup pretty well.Guava also has a best friend, Puppy, who is not a good person. Burned all her bridges last year. Me and Cigar dislike her, and Guava and I have an unspoken rule to not have either of them around when we hang out.Recently, Guava introduced me to her friend Jordan, and we hit it off well. He invited me to his birthday party, and I wanted to bring Cigar with me, but I asked Guava first to be safe. Jordan was okay with it. Guava got upset and left me on read after saying some childish stuff. The next day, she texted me to say that bringing Cigar would be a terrible idea, because she was already planning on bringing Puppy.Knowing that she's bringing Puppy regardless, and seeing how immature she's acting, makes me think I shouldn’t have asked her in the first place. Plus, if Puppy is going to be there, I'll have no one to hang out with at the party. Would it be wrong for me to bring Cigar?He knows about the whole situation, but said whatever I decide is fine.EDIT: I meant WIBTA.

	"title" : "AITA for tapping a woman on the top of her head with a finger because she was browsing facebook in the movies?",
	"body" : "My girlfriend and I went to the movies. The lights go fully out and the movie begins. As in the actual movie, not ads. Diagonally in front of me sits a middle aged woman writing a comment on a facebook post on her phone, with the screen brightness very high. I wanted to let her know that that's not okay, so I leaned forward, tapped her gently twice on the top of her head and quietly said \"Put away your phone.\" I am not sure she heard me because I said it pretty quietly not to bother other people, but I am sure she didn't understand me because later it turned out she didn't speak my language. Either way, she took the hint and put away her phone. She said something to her companion indicating towards her head.After the movie, nothing immediately happened, though I do think the woman and her companion argued whether they should say something or not. Eventually, her companion turned to me and angrily said: \"Next time, keep your hands to yourself\" (in English). Then they stormed off. I said nothing to them.I was then about to comment on the thing to my girlfriend but was cut off when my girlfriend started scolding me, saying I have no manners. We discussed it on the way home and her opinion was that other people's personal space is such a sacred thing that there is never a reason to violate it in any way. She also said that someone being a jerk doesn't give me permission to be a jerk to them. She would therefore vote ESH here.I know I could have only verbally told her to put away the phone but I opted for touching the woman because I didn't want to make a lot of noise, as the movie was already playing. In hindsight, I would have had to say it to her at least twice because she didn't speak my language. I hardly think a tap on the head is comparable to other invasions of personal space like some sort of fondling or a hug. I would have rather tapped her on the shoulder but as she was a row ahead of me so I couldn't reach it.There are just two rules that, if you can follow them, make you an absolute top of the class model citizen in a movie theatre: shut up & don't use your phone. I always make sure I turn off my phone completely well before the movie starts. Excessive, maybe, but I would be absolutely mortified if my phone started acting up in a movie theatre. You'd also never see me browsing my phone after the movie has already started. If you were, I'd like to be immediately notified that I am bothering others, be it a tap on the head or some other way. In that case I'd be embarrassed as hell and make sure to apologise after the movie.So, was I an asshole for touching to get the woman's attention?EDIT: Alright, the general consensus is that I was in the wrong for touching her, and I accept that. There are other, better ways to get someone's attention, and you can be sure I resort to them any time some asshole uses a phone in the theatre.On a more worrisome note, several people are threatening violence. Not cool. Some people are trying to make this some sort of sexist thing, that I wouldn't have done so to a man. Not true. It even appears that these same people think that I wouldn't have done it to a man out of fear of being punched. I actually find it kind of sexist to think that any man's reaction to being tapped on the head would be instant berserk mode and punching. Please don't do that to people that annoy you. You are just creating a bad stereotype out of all men.Several people seem to think that it's perfectly okay to use a phone in a theatre. Yeah, you people are assholes. Even at lowest brightness it's very distracting in a completely dark room. Not using a phone in a theatre is the very basic etiquette that I thought all children are taught, but I guess not. Movie tickets are very expensive these days, please don't ruin the experience to others thinking that your social media or even dying grandma is more important. Thank you.",

We were having a lot of trouble on what to name our child because we had such different ideas for the babies name, but we decided to not stress about during the pregnancy and wait until she had our baby to decide the name.After a while of deciding, I had decided that I thought it would be good to name our son after my recently deceased father whose name was Francis. I thought that this would be a perfect name that we would both agree on since she was extremely close with my dad when he was still with us. Before I could tell her about my idea for the name, her water broke and she was having bad contractions, so I rushed her to the er and forgot about the name entirely.She went into labor and ended up having to get an emergency C-Section, which was obviously very unplanned. Afterwards, to try to clear my stress I was doing the paperwork and decided that I would put down the name Francis as the babies official name so that when my wife  was okay after the surgery she wouldn’t have to worry about choosing the name. In this moment I didn’t realize I had totally forgotten to even tell her about my idea for our sons name.This is the part where I realized that I might be an asshole. When I told my wife about the name, she instantly flipped out at me. She screamed at me “You know the name Francis makes me uncomfortable since it’s my exes name!” I knew her ex from a previous relationship had the name, but I didn’t realize it was that serious and it had totally slipped my mind in the moment. Trying to keep her calm, I said “Don’t worry babe, it’s not that big of a deal. It’ll all be okay.” she instantly screamed back at me “It won’t be okay! My son is going to be walking around for the rest of his life with MY exes name!” In the heat of the moment I shouted back “Well it sounds like to me you are still a little bit caught up on him!” After that she screamed back “Just go!” And I knew that there was no point in arguing with her anymore.She hasn’t talked to me much since and we just got home from the hospital and she still is giving me the silent treatment.

Also, we talked briefly about naming our son after a family member and she seemed okay with it and she said that we should keep it as an option, and since we couldn’t agree on anything else I thought it would be okay. I also don’t constantly think about my wife’s exes, so it truly slipped my mind going in. I understand that we can change the name, and I plan on talking to her about it. I’ve read the few responses posted and I’ll keep those things in mind when I talk to her.",

	"title" : "AITA for gifting my sister makeup and a new dress and shoes",
	"body" : "This is a throw awayThe title might not sound bad but my family sure is making it a big deal.A little background: I(27F) am the second oldest of 4 children, 1 older brother (32), 1 younger sister (22), and 1 younger brother (19). This conflict is between me and my younger sister Rita.So I am single and plan to be for a while, but my sister Rita wants to get married one day and have kids and live her dream life. Now I'm not denying that she won't! She has many great qualities that men want in a woman: she cleans when she's bored, she loves cooking (hates baking tho idk why), she's kind of a peacekeeper and is soft spoken, she wants to be a SAHM and not work, and above all else, she's beautiful! Everyone loves her and supports her wishes but my only problem is she doesn't go out! She never leaves her house except for work, college, and groceries, and she has never made any male friends or advances on men.I've asked her why she's never tried at least talking to men if she wants to get married and she's used the same excuse \"when the time is right, I'll find him.\" LAME! I've tried inviting her to parties but she was always uncomfortable or hid somewhere so I kinda stopped doing that.Anyway a few days ago was Rita's birthday and she asked for a few things so me and my siblings split up who would get her what while my parents wanted to just give her a cash gift. I ended up having to gift her a specific handheld vacuum cuz her current one can't pick up her cats fur anymore. So instead I got her almost $150 worth of new makeup and a new dress and matching heels. I was proud of my gift so when it was time for her to open presents, she opened mine last and when she did, she was shocked to say the least. I told her \"now we can go to parties together again, I can teach you how to do your makeup\" but she was not happy. After the party, Rita told me I can have my gift back because she didn't need it. She said that she thought it was thoughtful but not the right kind.So this is where I might be the AH, I yelled at her saying she was ungrateful and was never going to find her dream husband if she stayed at home all day and that I was only trying to help. She said she didn't need help and again \"in due time, I'll find a man worth a home-cooked meal\" whatever that means. I yelled back that she's delusional and that with the state of the world, she'd never find a good man.The rest of our family heard us yelling and told me to leave her alone. They could tell I wanted to say a few more things but I knew I shouldn't even tho I was so mad so as I left, I just told her I hoped her dreams never came true if she wasn't gonna try to present herself. My family's been distancing themselves after they told me my behavior was disgusting and uncalled for but again I was only trying to help and it wouldn't hurt her to maybe try talking to someoneSo AITA?Edit: ok I get it, you all think I'm evil but for those of you who are saying gross things, I am not incestuous or anything of that sort, that's disgusting. And I'm not jealous, why tf would I be? Shut up about that, touch some grass instead",

	"body" : "I (36f) am thinking of adopting a pet (a dog or a cat) even though my husband (42M) doesn’t want one. I’ve been thinking about this for awhile, like the last 15 years.Context: en I was growing up my family had a cat, and then when I was a little older we got a dog. And I loved them dearly. I’ve always wanted to adopt a dog or cat on my own, but wasn’t really ready for the responsibility during college. And then after graduating I moved out of the US for a few years so I didn’t adopt while abroad.Luckily during this time I was living with Roommates who usually did have pets and I loved it - while not mine, being around animals was always so much fun.Anyways I also met my (now) husband while I was abroad, and I was always open with him about wanting to have a pet. My husband does not share that feeling. He did not grow up with pets, and while he’s lived with pets and is not allergic. This is starting to become an issue now. We’ve been together for 11 years, married for 7 and have 2 young kids. When we  moved back to the US (like 9 years ago) we had a really small apartment in a big city. We got engaged (around the same time) and he said he’d be okay getting a pet once we had a bigger place. Well after a few years we got a bigger place with a yard and a fence. So I started talking about getting a pet. He said he’d prefer a dog to a cat, but that getting one would be irresponsible as we were both working full time in the office and wouldn’t be spend enough time with the dog who’d be home all day alone. Fair. I waited. Then we both started to have more flexible schedules and I got a remote job that let me work from home. I ask again about getting a dog, and he said ‘okay, you can get a dog, but just know if you do my quality of life will be extremely negatively impacted if you do.’So at the time I was like - a little dramatic maybe, but I’m not going to do something that would cause you so much harm. But kind of always felt like the ball was in my court. That was about 5 years ago.Since then we’ve had our two kids (4&1) and we moved out of the city to a really outdoorsy place with loads of trails. I’ve taken a new higher paying WFH role that way less of a demand on my schedule with a bump in pay and I’m thinking of adopting a pet again. I brought it up with my husband recently and he immediately said absolutely not. No discussion. Just pure annoyance at the thought.But he now travels a lot for work while I’m with the kids (when they’re not at daycare) by myself a lot of the week. I’m at a place where I can take pretty much all the responsibility on.Plus I feel like we had come to an agreement when we we got engaged about getting a pet but the goalposts kept changing and now we’re here.I guess I’m finding I care less about how his quality of life will be impacted and more about my own wants. And that’s what it is - a want, I don’t need a pet but I’ve waited a long time and feel like I’m done waiting.",

I told my husband we shouldn’t bring anything because they have plenty of ability to feed the 15 people they invited without offloading that labor onto the guests for no true reason other than they don’t want to pay for it.

I sometimes wonder if moving in together so early on was a mistake… but that’s besides the point.For context, my family lives in a different country and his family is from the same country but different region. We live in an extremely small apartment (30m2) with two cats. Needless to say, it’s mostly their apartment and not our, seen as it’s full of cat toys and litter boxes. As for the “kitchen”, I bought a 140€ IKEA “kitchenette” just to have a sink to wash the plates in and some counter top space. We don’t have an oven and cook on hot plates.Both my parents came to our city a couple months ago and I let them come up because they’d only met one of my two cats. I know my parents are aware and aren’t judgy of my situation, so I didn’t hesitate to let them come over.A week ago, my mom and grandma came to bring me some documents I needed for university. Knowing my grandma’s standards, I knew that if I let her in my apartment I’d never hear the end of it. Plus, my boyfriend wasn’t cooperating with the cleaning. So I just avoided the entire situation and met up with them at their Airbnb (owned by a family friend).Bf’s mom and grandma want to come visit and bring some food over. They’re staying for 4 days, sleeping at his uncle’s house (who lives in our same city). He’s what one might call both a mamma’s boy and a grandma’s boy (he’s Italian). Everything they say or do is right in his eyes. His grandma and I have had a few arguments in the past because she obviously only thinks about her grandson’s wellbeing and not my boundaries. Well, when I got home today from class I caught him deep cleaning the house because he wants his grandma to see our apartment.We got into a huge fight because I don’t want anyone coming over that I know will judge the size, cleanliness (cats don’t help)  and overall furnishing of my house. I told him no one is coming over and accused him of not lifting a finger when my grandma was here and cleaning every inch of the house when his is coming.Am I exaggerating?

I had made it known from the beginning that I would appreciate if my bf would drive me to the airport. This was just a natural expectation I had, as I’ve always had family members drop me off or pick me up at airports my whole life. It was just what you do. My bf however considered this to be a huge ask. On his side of the family, there is a very high level of caution when it comes to driving, and that a drive to JFK is something you just don’t do, it’s expected that you just take public transportation or call a car service. My bf himself also has a decent amount of anxiety when it comes to driving. My point was that, we would be driving at a very quiet hour, it would give us some extra time together before I leave, and also it’s just not that bad of a drive! He said ok, and that he would drive me, then on the evening of said he didn’t think he could handle it and called me an Uber.During my week away, my bf had considered that maybe he was overreacting about the drive (I had told him how empty the highway was during my Uber trip), and said that he would pick my up at JFK when I came home. As the day closer, I could tell he was getting more hesitant about the drive again, and I was getting anxious that he would back out again. He kept hinting at not wanting to do it and said he had begun to feel back pain after a night at the casino with friends. Fast forward to the evening of my flight back East and I get the call that my bf will no longer be picking me up at JFK.I was with my family in this moment and was visibly upset and disappointed.

My sister was so upset that I was upset and decided to talk to my boyfriend herself and convinced him to pick me up.So my bf did end up picking me up at JFK after my flight back.

Not only did he get angrier after I called him dramatic, Will basically called me stupid and naïve without outright saying the word stupid.He’s still being salty over the joke and me calling him dramatic. It’s so annoying that I’m this close to telling my brother everything just to prove that Will is acting like a baby over a perfectly harmless joke.AITA?",

	"body" : "First time posting so I’m sorry if it’s long and rambling.Background: my boyfriend’s car needs new tires. And in order for him to get new tires he needs to replace his front tie rod that’s causing his tires to wear unevenly. He still has a loan out on the car so to pay for the repairs and the tires he borrowed against the loan again to pay for the repairs. He doesn’t take out loans or ask for money ever. On top of that, past week has been hectic. We had an apartment inspection on Thursday afternoon. I have ADHD (I’m seeing a counselor and am on medications) so I’m a walking tornado of a person (stuff out everywhere dishes not cleaned regularly, etc) so I have been cleaning and organizing everything this past week by myself so we don’t fail this inspection. I started with the kitchen last Friday and was working my way around the apartment. But I did have to use the kitchen throughout the week so the piles started adding up again. I cleaned the whole thing again on Wednesday night.Story: This past Tuesday (it was Sunday night when this was posted) my boyfriend’s cashiers check for his car came to the apartment. He put it on a clean and empty counter with the thought in mind that I would see it, realize it’s important, and leave it somewhere safe or keep it on the counter. Well, while I was cleaning the kitchen again on Wednesday I didn’t see this check, or just saw paper and thought “oh it’s out on the counter it must be trash,” and threw away the check for his car repairs. He is going tomorrow to take out another loan until the 90 day window clears when the check comes up as uncashed and the amount reverts back to the original balance on the car loan. He says it’s my fault for throwing out the check, and if I asked a group of 100 people they’re all agree with him. So, I came to Reddit.I just want to know, AITA for throwing away the check, or is he TA for leaving such an important piece of paper out in an area that was getting cleared again soon.TLDR: AITA for throwing away a what I didn’t realize was a cashiers check (my boyfriend left out on the kitchen counter) while I was manically cleaning the apartment before our yearly inspection?",

	"body" : "This is a complex question, so I'll try to be brief, but some background information is necessary to explain my perspective.My middle daughter (now in her early 30s) has always had a strong will and mind of her own. She gave us a lot of grief growing up. She was the only of her siblings to ever sneak out, date secretly, experiment with drugs, and she has a mouth on her sometimes and talks back to people without hesitation.She also was always the brightest of all our family and excelled at school easily, despite those behavioural hiccups along the way. We spent a lot of time trying to get her on a path to success because we knew she had a bright future ahead.She moved out for college, stayed away for grad school, then moved even further away for more schooling. There were some spaces in between degrees where she worked but she never came to live back home like her siblings did. All her other siblings are married, have careers, houses, and kids. Middle daughter is still working on university projects. Whenever we ask when she will have a PhD she gives vague answers.We have reason to worry. She was once in an abusive relationship that lasted many years. He didn't hit her but he was a huge creep and nobody liked him, we told her all the time but it was like she was brainwashed. When she got out of it she moved cities and even said \"You were right, mom\" about it so I vowed to keep a closer eye on her.She recently visited. She has a boyfriend now for several years who I have only met once when I flew to visit them. He never comes to visit us and she says he can't afford time off work.He works a low level job, has only a high school diploma. He had a difficult upbringing with violence and is estranged from his family. I can't imagine what they have in common.My daughter is now saying she does not want children or a home, and that she is taking psychiatric medication of some kind. I was immediately worried she was in another controlling situation leading her to make such drastic decisions and I brought up out of concern that she should reconsider whether this is a real match for her or whether she's being controlled again.She was furious, and her mouth went off. She didn't even want to hear my reasoning that I wrote here and went to bed early. Clearly, I caused a fight, but since I don't know this man I just can't assess any other way whether she's safe.Did I cross a line, since she's an adult? I still want to talk about it but not if we will just fight",

Damian is this 6,3 ft tall dude who thinks he can do whatever he wants. Today was his first day. It was also his last. He walked in like he owned the dam place. I tried to show him how to do his job cuz nobody else wanted to. He basically ignored everything I tried to show/teach him. I would call him over to a red light (means something went wrong) to show him what to do in a certain scenario. He didn’t care. He also didn’t have his numbers(he can’t do red lights without them). I told him that there are other things he can do as well. Like sweeping, putting bags on the bag racks, and cleaning the checkouts. Still, didn’t care. He started to piss me off because he hadn’t done anything all day. I showed him where to put claims (broken stuff). When we got back, one of my co-workers handed me a not so frozen, frozen pizza. I asked Damian to put it in claims. When I handed it to him, that’s when he really started to piss me off. As soon as he grabbed it, he slapped me with it, punched me in the shoulder and stuck it in my vest pocket. I calmly took it out of my pocked and told him more firmly, to put it in claims. Then one of my other co-workers (my best friend) who I will call Beth, asked him if he knew where the ice cream was. He said yes. So Beth handed him a box of ice cream pops and asked him nicely to put it away. He said “Fuck no you little Bitch. Put it away yourself.” Then he proceeded to hit Beth in the head with the box. Now I’m the kind of guy will tear you a new asshole if you hit one of my friends. When I saw this, Beth started crying. I yelled at Damian and told him to put the box away. Not only did he ack like a bully from middle school, he cursed at and insulted people a lot. I don’t know why, but I was willing to give this guy 1 last chance before I told my boss. About half an hour later, I’m sweeping by the registers and he walks up to me and says, “Look at the little fucking slave sweeping and cleaning like a slave.” I told him to shut the fuck up and go away. After he left, I went over to my boss and told her what happened. She was PISSED. She had me tell her everything. What he was saying, what he was doing, if he hit anyone else, and how he was acting. I told her everything. She called over another one of my bosses so I could tell him the same thing. Then she called over her boss. So I was talking to both of my bosses and their boss. They were all pissed. They went to talk to Damian and pulled him into a private room. From what I know, they ripped him a new one. They were going to give him a second chance, but he acted like an asshole to them too. They fired him on the spot. He wouldn’t leave so they called the cops. They dragged him out. I have a feeling that. He is going to come in one day and try to fight me. On the way out my boss yelled, “Have a nice life!” I wasn’t trying to get him fired, I just wanted him to stop being an asshole. I am kinda glad he got fired tho.

I know they have talked some about the counselors and careworkers they used to see growing up but they never mention much of it. They just mention a lot of speech therapy and counseling being traumatic for them.Now that they are done with their PhD and are teaching full time. They want a wheelchair. They’ve been disclosing to me that they are “finally getting the accommodations they deserve”. They claim they bump into walls, desks, and have been marked off at work for it. And claim by time they get home, they are too overwhelmed to function much. So they are trying different things that help them.He mentions that his sense of where he is at in space is very off and when he used a chair for a day, he found himself more outspoken, connected, and moving around even more because he could roll it himself and it didn’t feel as exhausted as walking.Their therapist and their fiancé support this behavior but as their best friend I can’t enable it. He needs to learn to grow up and not be lazy just cause he is tired.I suggested to him that he get tested by his doctor. If his body is in that much pain or he feels like his brain can’t tell his legs to move then he needs more help than a wheelchair. I asked him what his work thinks. He said that he thinks they think he has a terminal illness.He snapped at me the other day when I said something about him taking his chair with us on a hike so he could try it out on the terrain. I told him to just walk —he doesn’t actually need it.He listened and went on the hike. But then he went off the path, dissociating and got lost. It took hours to find him. By the time I did he completely shut down and didn’t talk. Just stared away from me.I feel like he is faking. How can he talk one second and not the other? And when I called his fiancé she got mad at me saying I wasn’t supposed to leave him alone. That he can’t be left alone in those situations until he has a rescue dog.Friends have said I’m too harsh on him. His fiancé told me he has “selective mutism” and I let her know if it’s selective why did he select then to do it?I feel as if I’m just setting boundaries.

Jakki won't talk to me and he's extremely down which makes me sad, but I feel like they are blowing it out of proportion. It's a shirt.

To be clear, I had met and become close with Parker my freshman year of college in a lecture about movie physics that we bonded over. I had known Jamie for longer, and all three of us became pretty close, forming a sort of friend group of four, including Parker’s roommate, who we’ll call Riley (22). Although, I saw Jamie as not only a friend, but a potential love interest, so I considered Parker my best friend.After finishing our exams, I was absolutely overjoyed to finally graduate. I decided that life was too short to waste by keeping my feelings from my childhood crush hidden. A few days before graduation I decided to tell Parker that I was going to finally confess to Jamie after years of waiting. Parker was suspiciously quiet, only responding by staring at me and taking a sip of his drink. When I asked him why he was just staring at me, he just shrugged it off before changing the topic to our friend group’s camping trip to celebrate our graduation. I was a little suspicious about how he was acting, but I let it go.//Our friend group had decided to get ready for graduation together so we all met up at Parker’s apartment. Riley was making lunch in the kitchen and asked me to go find Jamie and Parker, who I hadn’t seen in a minute. As I was walking in the hallway I heard something in Parker’s room, where I saw him kissing Jamie. I didn’t know how to react. I could only stare in shock. It felt like hours, and it felt like there was a painful lump in my throat. I think he might have heard me gasp, because he eventually stopped to look at me, with an embarrassed look on his face. He nervously laughed before telling me that he and Jamie were dating. I was just disappointed at first, but I couldn’t stop myself from asking how long. Parker then revealed that they had been dating for seven months.I. Was. Livid. Parker had known for over 3 years about how I felt about Jamie, and I couldn’t believe he would betray me like this. I’m not the most outspoken person, so I was always nervous about telling Jamie, WHICH PARKER KNEW, so I couldn’t believe that my best friend would steal my crush away from me. Not only this, but then would keep it a secret from me for so long!We got in a large screaming match where I said many things I regretted, such as calling him a cheating son of a b**h, a treasonous bstard, and undeserving of love. Before Parker could try to lie his way out of this one and give me some flimsy excuse, I stormed off.He could’ve at least apologized for breaking my heart, or done literally anything at all to try to make things better.

I tried to talk to him about this but he was never clear with what he wanted.When the day of our anniversary came, we got to the boat without much issue. BF was unusually quiet, but I was still looking forward to the evening. But once we were on the boat, I kept trying to make conversation with him, but he was clearly unhappy despite all the work I had put in to making sure we had the perfect evening. After maybe ten minutes, he pulled out his phone, which really set me off.Now, one thing you need to know about me before I continue is that I was raised in a household where we value interpersonal connection. No phones at the dinner table, no phones during family time—in general, I’m the kind of person who gets really frustrated by phones being where they shouldn’t be. Particularly, during a date commemorating our one-year anniversary seemed like an obviously inappropriate time and place for phones.Naturally, you will assume I was less than pleased when BF pulled his phone out of his pocket, so before I even had the chance to think I grabbed it and threw it in the sea. He immediately freaked out on me, asking why I did that and calling me irrational when he was just checking his phone for a text. I told him he was being rude during what was supposed to be us time. And this is the moment when he finally decides to let me know that he has a fear of open water, and has (apparently) been uncomfortable all day. Now, BF’s family has been calling me non-stop expecting me to somehow find him the money for a new phone.So, Reddit, AITA? On one hand, BF is angry with me for throwing his phone away and “making the date all about me,” but on the other hand, I think it is incredibly rude to pull out your phone while your SO is trying to talk to you on your anniversary.Edit: Wow, I did not expect this to blow up. I got a lot of responses and I haven’t read all of them yet, but I will try to read them when I wake up in the morning. But I do want to say to all of you to please be kinder in your judgments. I will try to accept criticisms of me, and I understand now that these responses aren’t always what I expected, but most of you know nothing about who I am as a person beyond this one tiny snippet of my life. Calling me crazy or abusive or whatever isn’t fair when none of you know me.",

	"body" : "I 43f have two daughters 16f and 12f. My older daughter Kate got a ps5 for her birthday some months ago, since that was what she wished for. The ps5 was very pricey and since were not very wealthy my younger daughter Mina wanted to add some money to our saved money for the ps5. Of course she did that voluntarily and I wouldn’t have expected something like that from her. She had saved about 60$ which was great and me and my husband of course were very thankful. However, now Minas birthday is coming up and she wants a new laptop. It costs about 600$ and we first wanted to deny it because we clearly don’t have enough money for something like that but then it seemed unfair that Kate had gotten something so big, so we thought that Mina would deserve that too. I thought of getting a second job for a period of time so that it would be easier for us to pay but my husband had the great idea of just taking some of Kate‘s saved money since it only would be fair. Mina also helped raise money for her ps5 so why shouldn’t Kate do that too. Also we knew that Kate had saved about 150$ which would help a lot. We knew that Kate was saving for some shoes, so we only asked for 100$ so she could keep some for a new pair of shoes. She rejected our suggestion. I got really mad because it would only be fair for Mina and she had saved so much money which she wouldn’t even need if she would just get a cheaper pair of shoes. I said that I would sell her ps5 if she wouldn’t agree. She started crying and screaming at me and calling me „heartless“. I got even more mad. Now I am „heartless“ even tho she obviously doesn’t care about her sister? I took away her ps5 and I am seriously thinking of selling it. My husband is on my side but some of my friends told me that I am overreacting. I am not sure if I should sell the ps5 so I am wondering am I overreacting and AITA?Update: hey everyone. First I wanted thank you all for your comments, even tho some were really harsh. I read them all and everyone was saying that I am the AH. I tried understanding why and I can kinda see where that’s coming from. I have now decided that I won’t take away the ps5 from my daughter and I asked Mina if it would be fine for her to get the laptop 2 months after her birthday so it would be easier to afford. She agreed My husband didn’t agree but I showed him the Reddit post and the comments and I think he now understands too.",

He would go up and I will go in the elevator and stop on all the floors on the way up to see if he is ok.I approve and like this since I think it builds confidence in relatively controlled environment, while my wife does not like it from fear he will fall on the way up and we won't be there to help him immediately.Today we came back from the park (me, my wife and our two kids). the toddler was asleep and my 3 y/o son wanted to go up the stairs.

I guess we could call her the “evil stepmother” I always overheard Em talking to my dad about making me move out and live with my mom so they can start their own family without me which.. is wrong right? Eventually em got pregnant which made her even more nasty towards me. My dad started ignoring me, not showing up to my softball games (which he made me start in the 8th grade up into 12th), not spending any time with me. After the baby was born my dad proposed to Em I was happy for him but I was also a little upset that he moved on after what 2 months had a kid then proposed? Whatever not the point.

	"body" : "*This should be posted in R/changemyview as \" parking in front of your neighbors house while you have parking in front of your own house is bullshit. Change my view. \" *The first day this guy moves in , he parks his truck directly in front of my mailbox , even though there is room in his driveway and in the street parking in front of his house. There is a tree and a flowerbed outlined with rocks showing where the properties are landmarked. I went to check my mailbox passive aggressively hoping he would notice , he did and said he could move the truck if I need to , flabbergasted by the sheer lack of awareness and consideration and being the first time this happened, I threw my hands in the air , didn't say a word and walked inside my house. He moved the truck .Lady Friday, I notice his woman's car (she drives a black suv) parked just in front of the mailbox,  a whole maybe 6 feet in front of the tree and flowerbed outlined by rocks, maybe 3 feet from the mailbox , so much so , a mailman would not be able to deliver mail, and my landscapers would have to park cut where the car is parked. Mind you, it is illegal to park on our street , it is a narrow country road. Also , it bothers me that they are not staying on their side and taking a parking spot that is on my side and infront of my house should I need it. Also, there was enough parking for one car in their driveway, and two cars in front of their side of the duplex unit, on the street parking in front of their \"house\".  I leaned towards not saying anything,  but my fiance convinced me I needed to say something and even offered herself to say something,  so not trusting her to speak carefully , I volunteered myself for the duty.I went over to the house , and his truck pulls up when I had originally planned on asking whoever was in the house , being their was also an unfamiliar white car parked in the driveway.  He stepped out of the truck , I shook his hand and introduced myself , him being relatively new ; we had not spoken yet. I then explained to him:\"sometimes my landscapers go in there(pointing at the spot in front of my house , literally in front of my big front window on the second story of my home , clearly across the obvious tree and flowerbed outlined by rocks that my landscapers cut all the time) and asked him : \"can you move the car please?\" He then said yeah , walking back to his 1 car garage in his twin ranch style duplex , \"she was just cleaning for a second , don't worry about it.\" So I said ok thank you . Then he goes into his garage and I hear him scream \"it's just a car, oh lord!\" Or something incredulous like this. I then humbly walk back to my house,  and he comes angrily staring me down with him glasses on . I disregarded it , and went back inside my house . He moved the car back to his side .AITA for asking my neighbor to move his car after the second time ?Edit: Thanks for the judgment guys. Alot of you would do better to learn the golden rule of \"loving your neighbor as yourself.\"  Not just secular laws. If they loved me as themselves they would park in their space I would in mine , that's fair and loving each other as ourselves. Seeing other AITA posts like \"AITA for giving up my first class seat on a plane to stop a baby from crying\", and you guys label him as an asshole , shows me reddit has ungodly judgment and I will never post here again . Thank you to the few who say NTA as you understand loving your neighbor as yourself and the rest of you would do better to practice it. Truth in love. Thanks. God bless.Edit 2 : I just want reserved parking in front of my house. I don't think that's too much to ask if everyone has one . If you people did not know there Is only 5 houses on my block with my house being the last to the east. A field to my right (east), neighbor #1 (out of 3 others) to my left, forest behind us , a barely two lane street in front , and a field in front of said street. Us 5 houses should have reserved parking for the residents. It's not that much to ask and is a luxury we all can afford. Thanks for the time and have a great day  .Edit 3: I welcomed him to the neigborhood and we shook hands. He said he should not have been so angry,  and I sympathized with him explaining I didn't want to go about that way right after he got home. I told him about jesus he is not religious , grew up methodist- but says we can talk another time as it was about 10 pm we were looking for our cat. Thanks guys have a blessed one.",

It was a suite so we were actually sleeping in different rooms, but it was still weird since I didn't know her very well and she'd been flirting with me nonstop since we met. I never explicitly rejected her but I think I made it pretty clear from my actions that I wasn't attracted to her.We talked for a little bit after we got to the room and then I went to take a shower and lie down. When I came out of my room, G was changing in the middle of the common area and was basically naked (she was wearing underwear but nothing else). She did the whole shrieking and covering her chest thing and she said “how dare you” or something like that, I don’t remember exactly what, but something that made it sound like I was being creepy and she was totally innocent.Well, I snapped. I told her that it was rich coming from her, because it’s not like we’re married and I didn’t even want to stay with her, and even if I did, I hate women who are constantly showing themselves off like that. She started crying and ran into her room, and I considered trying to comfort her but decided not to because she was probably just acting. I just knocked on her door to let her know I was gonna go for a walk, and then I left.Later that night, this guy we'd been traveling with (30M) came to our room looking for her. He said they were planning to get dinner together and asked me what had happened between us. I told him we’d gotten into a little argument and explained exactly why. He seemed shocked. He told me that was a horrible thing to say and that I didn’t understand women at all. We didn’t get to talk more because G came out of her room all dolled up and immediately wrapped herself around K’s arm. She didn’t talk to me or even say goodbye when they left.We didn’t talk very much after that, she cooled down on the flirting and we were towards the end of our travels so it wasn't a big deal. The other guy was certainly happy with how it all turned out, he made some gross comments to me the next day and basically told me he slept with her since I missed my chance.Now that I’ve been home for a couple days I just keep thinking about it though. I talked to my sister (23F) about the whole thing, and she called me an idiot and said that I shouldn’t have “slut shamed” G. Maybe the way I said it was a little mean, but everything I said was true. I have no interest in a barely legal teenager who sleeps with any man who pays attention to her, and if she’s gonna put herself on display like that she should be prepared for the backlash. Still, I can’t shake the thought that I might have actually hurt her feelings, and maybe I should’ve been nicer or at least tried to apologize afterward. AITA?EDIT: This was a military thing, we were both there as guests of relatives, neither of us are in the military. Not saying anything more specific than that. G insisted we share a room, I didn’t want to stay with her. Please stop asking me to explain the situation because the full explanation is way too long and doesn’t change much about what happened.",

But he’s often hesitant to show me his artwork, and when it does it’s quite good but still amateur compared to other art I’ve seen.I found out yesterday that my son plans on taking commissions for artwork once he levels up his skills, as a way to pay for college and make money to save up and get out of the house. I think that it’ll be quite a fruitless endeavour and that he’ll make less than working a minimum wage job (Around $13 where we live), he won’t have enough to pay it off. Plus I don't want him doing that, or working at all, whilst studying because his major is going to require all of his attention and no amount of \"get off my back\" will change my mind about it.So yesterday I sat down with my son and I explained to him that due to his unrefined skills, he shouldn’t expect to make a lot of money from doing commissions, and it’s best if he just let us pay for his tuition and he can take out loans and apply for scholarships.But my son got upset at me and told me that the reason why he’s unskilled is because he’s had to deal with motivation issues his whole life before he was prescribed Adderall recently and that we’re “neglectful”, that it’s also because we kept the computer he paid for in the living room until he was 18 (we couldn't trust him to use it independently because he kept violating the rules regarding usage as a child) and felt insulated because he didn’t want to draw out in the open for people to judge him (yep, blame his problems on others I see), and that this is the reason why he’s unskilled and doesn’t tell us about what he does as we never “supported him” and he greatly resents us, and he left the room.Since then what he’s said has stuck with me and I can’t help but feel guilty for it. Should I have said what I did?

	"body" : "So me (25F) and my sister (23F) come from a more traditional family. Our family are strong Christians and one of the things we feel strong about is no sex before marriage, and no dating around, meaning not jumping from relationship to relationship. Commitment is important.However, my sister has been pretty much the rebel and has broken all the rules. In high school, she dated a guy for about a year, but then she dumped him and moved on to someone else for about a month, before finally meeting her current boyfriend her senior year of high school. I mean these are just the guys that I know of, but there were rumors going around when we were in high school that she was dating one of her guy friends but I'm not really sure if that's true or just a rumor. Anyway, this is not the only way she has rebelled. She would dress kind of immodestly: short skirts and shorts, crop tops, tops with really low backs, tops that would be too tight in the chest area, you get the picture.But the biggest thing of all was that she had premarital sex. We didn't really know that she was engaging in that, until she got pregnant. Obviously it wasn't planned. My sister and her boyfriend had decided to keep the baby. We assumed that they would be getting married and have a \"shotgun\" wedding, but they kind of surprised us when they said that they weren't planning on getting married at the moment. My mom said that they were just adding on to their mistakes by not getting married before the baby is born, because that's just not how our family runs things, and that's just not what we believed in.However, this wouldn't matter anyway, because 2 weeks after this, my sister miscarried. She and her boyfriend were really upset and she came to me and my parents. She didn't understand why it happened, because she didn't drink smoke or do any rigorous activity. I just told her that it kind of made sense to me. She asked me what I meant. I told her that the fact that she had premarital sex, which is something that we and our religion is against, got pregnant, and decided not to get married, which is also something that we're against, so it just made sense that God didn't want her to have this baby. I mean it was doomed from the start. She started crying and yelled at me, asking me how I could say such a thing. I just told her that I was just being honest. She stormed out of the room, and my mom ran after her. My dad came up to me and told me that I could have said what I said differently. I mean maybe, but again, I was just stating a fact.

GF was silent the whole time and kind of shaking her head.after the sister left, gf said I was really embarassing, ignorant and should never ''invaded'' their conversation like that and that I was a total dick and should apologize to her sister or she won't talk to me until i do but I dont see how I was an asshole, i was only telling her facts i saw online which she can look up too, if she can't handle something as small as this, i don't see how she can handle raising a live human being who will probably say and do 10x worse stuff than this.so AITA for telling gf's sister that getting pregnant isn't as hard as she's making it out to be?",

	"body" : "My girlfriend of 2 years has quite bad asthma. She was an experimental industrial worker for a number of years, and dealt with a lot of chemicals. Unfortunately, this lead to her developing occupational asthma. This means that if she is around any irritants, it sets her off.This has been a bit of an issue in our relationship, especially in the first year or so. She would be dusting the bedroom every single night. She would tell me to dry my hair (which I put products in) in the living room with the window open. I couldn't have any blankets or anything with non-natural fibres, in case it set her allergies off. When we went to gigs and shows with a lot of artificial fog, she would have to wear a mask and go to the hallway for breaks, etc. It was just a lot to deal with. We did argue a bit about this, and I told her a few times to go to counselling about it, because I sincerely do not think the irritants are that big of an issue - her anxiety probably makes it worse.Anyway, I make big accommodations for her now.Last week, we went to dinner with my long-time friend and her partner. It's the first time my girlfriend was meeting my friend. My girlfriend asked where we were going beforehand, but my friends and I like to keep things spontaneous, so I told her that we'll just decide when we meet up. We weren't sure if my friend wanted dinner or anything. When we all met up, it turns out my friend did want dinner, so we walked around a bit, got rejected from a few places since it was saturday evening, and eventually all settled on a chinese BBQ place.The ventilation in the restaurant wasn't great, but my friends were hungry, so we waited 5 minutes for a table and went in. I didn't even register that this would be an issue. About 30 minutes in, my girlfriend said she needed to leave, and left - it was a little awkward for the group, but she explained her health issues, and left.Afterwards, I met up with my girlfriend, and she told me I didn't care about her lung issues. She was having some severe breathing issues at this point, and didn't have her inhaler. She told me that she felt it'd be really strange to just leave immediately, especially since everyone else wanted BBQ and not her. She gave it a shot, but couldn't handle it and left.She made me feel really bad, and told me that I could have helped her, suggesting we go somewhere else, or voicing that she could go if she wanted, since she was meeting my friends.I don't know. I feel like she's just taking this out on me. I'm unsure how to approach this, or how to cope with the situation, to be honest. Would it be okay if I just told her that her health is her responsibility and not mine? I didn't even think about her lungs, to be honest.I do agree the restaurant was pretty smoky. AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA For Telling On My Roommates for Smoking Weed?",
	"body" : "I (23F) am in my senior year of college. I have a lot of mental health issues (generalized anxiety, major depression, and PTSD) and physical health issues, which has led me to getting an emotional support cat and housing accommodations. Before school started I reached out to my three roommates and informed them of my situation. The first roommate (Laura, 21F) was fine with it. The second roommate (Rita,19) was a little hesitant, but willing to make it work. The third roommate (Nellie,19) objected and said that she had a friend that was more than willing to switch with me. She ignored all of my further messages and went straight to the housing office and tried to get me kicked out ( the office contacted me and told me). Rita and Nellie are friends, so the more I spoke to Rita the more she assured me that Nellie didn’t actually have any issues, she just doesn’t particularly like cats. Once school started everything was okay for about a week, but then I got a text from them telling me that my cat kept getting on the counters. I apologized and told them that I would do whatever I could to prevent her from getting on the counters. After that I proceeded to keep my cat in my room for 90% of the day, but she gets antsy so at night I would let her out. I also put aluminum foil on the counter to deter her from getting on them and disinfected every morning. My issues with them are their friends. Due to my PTSD I have some issues with men and ALL of their friends are really big burly men. Their friends were constantly over and my mental health was deteriorating fast, so I asked them if they could tell me when their friends were coming over so that I can either mentally prepare or leave, they agreed. The next day, they continued to have people over without telling me. About a week had passed and I grew increasingly upset, so I ended up sending them a very antagonistic text message (which I regret). Of course, it ended in a long fight that ended with me contacting our RA. We ended up having a meeting with the RA where they agreed to inform me of guests and I agreed to stay downstairs with my cat (they apparently still had issues with my cat). You’d think that would be the end of it, but no, now they tell me about guests maybe 30% of the time. Now put that with the fact that they NEVER clean and leave huge messes, leave huge chunks of hair everywhere(i've even found some in the freezer), scream at the top of their lungs to get the attention of each other(not an exaggeration), and the incessant weed smoking. I don’t normally have issues with smoking, but they do it so often and it is so potent that it makes me feel sick. I am at my wits end and I feel like I can’t talk to them about it since they don’t respect the one issue that I did speak to them about. I feel like going to my RA was the best thing for me, but I am feeling a little guilty about it since they can get in trouble for the weed. AITA?Edit: I can't move because I was given housing accommodations and this dorm was chosen specifically because it best fits my needs for my physical disabilities. Our school has a lot of disabled students so yes, the other dorms with accommodations are full.Edit: It turns out that Nellie objected because #1 she wanted their friend to move in with them and #2 Rita was supposed to bring her non-ESA approved dog with her and since I was bringing my cat she could not. I saw a lot of comments saying that I was forcing my roommates to live with a cat so I wouldn't like to clarify that #1 they were told about the cat months in advance so that they could find other housing if they so choose and #2 they weren't going to tell me about their dog until after we moved in! The only reason they told me was because it conflicted with me bringing my cat.Update: First, I would like to thank those who gave me actual constructive criticism and to those who supported me. So it turns out that at my school I have to call at the exact moment they are smoking weed in order for them to get in trouble. That being said, I decided not to say anything. I know that telling on them would take it to far, so I just decided to endure it. I did speak to my RA and RD about the issues they already knew we were having and they informed me that my two roommates are actually looking to be placed somewhere else next semester. I feel bad that they have to pack up all of their things and move, but I feel like it is what is best for everyone. Nobody was getting along and staying under the same roof would have made everyone miserable.update 2: I was just informed that they are no longer moving and went downstairs to them eating my food. cheers to a terrible four more months!",

	"body" : "I (20F) embarked on a journey to Europe with dreams of a better future and a thriving career in fashion. Little did I know, this adventure would turn into a rollercoaster of challenges and emotional turmoil that would leave me questioning my relationships and my own actions. So, AITA for feeling abandoned by my mother and not reaching out to her after she shared my confidential plans with her?My arrival in Europe marked the beginning of a series of trials that I could hardly have anticipated. Living with my cousin's family initially was far from the warm embrace I expected. His wife's complaints made me feel like a burden, and their hospitality felt anything but genuine. After a month of relentless searching, I secured a spot in a shared house with 25 people. The conditions were grim, with dirty bathrooms and chaos ruling that place. I even found myself accused of theft simply because my roommate assumed I had used her hair products just cause I have curly hair.Amidst the turmoil, I managed to secure employment as a hotel housekeeper and establish a semblance of normalcy. But the feeling of homesickness soon consumed me, and I spent three months back in my home country, hoping for a warm reunion. Instead, I faced the harsh reality that life had moved on without me. My friends seemed distant, their routines uninterrupted, leaving me with a profound sense of isolation.Undeterred, I returned to Europe, determined to reignite my fading dreams. I confided in my mother about an unconventional plan to extend my stay with her, believing she would understand my aspirations and challenges. However, she crossed a line by sharing my confidential plans with the vice principal of my school without my consent. This betrayal cut deep, leaving me questioning her actions and motives.In response, I chose to distance myself from her, a decision that weighs heavily on my heart. I sought solace in conversations with my sister, hoping for some understanding and validation. To my surprise, my mother's perspective shocked me. She failed to acknowledge her misstep and rather dismissively believed I was overreacting. While I recognize that her intentions might not have been malicious, her lack of empathy feels like a sharp knife through my already wounded emotions.Now, I haven't called my mother in a week, hoping to convey my hurt and disappointment to her. On the other hand, her assertion that I would need her before she would need me sounds selfish, complicating my emotions further. I'm feeling like my vulnerability has been taken advantage of.I need judgment on whether I'm the asshole for withholding contact from my mother, despite the fact that she disregarded my trust in her and shared my private plans without my consent. I feel conflicted because, while her actions hurt me deeply, I question whether my response of not calling her might be too harsh. Could my emotional reaction be justified, or am I overreacting to a difficult situation?",

She’s been promoted three times and the owner regularly talks about how she’ll one day run the kitchen.When restaurants closed at the start of the pandemic, she used her funemployment to start making cooking videos on TikTok.

I would never tell her this, but they’re just not that compelling or they just copy videos that are already out there.Instead, I told her that I didn’t think we could afford to not have her income (which is largely true) and that her TikTok has not been successful enough to generate money.

	"body" : "So my girlfriend and I are both students at a rather large university in my area. We've been together for almost three years now, and although she has been on a few voice calls with me, my girlfriend hadn't met my parents in person before, since they live quite far away. Recently they flew in to visit me, and my girlfriend and I were both looking forward to the occasion.Now something worth noting about my girlfriend in that context is that she's kind of a hippie at heart. She has an alternative (though nice) style of dress, and come the summer months, she will often just ditch shoes and go barefoot all day. Honestly I personally don't mind, I find it kind of charming actually, but when my parents came to visit, I reminded her that my parents can be quite conservative and to think of that when she decides what to wear, and to dress up a little.We had different schedules that day so the next time I see her was in front of the restaurant where we would meet my parents. I was doing small talk with them when she arrived, and she was wearing a nice sundress, but no shoes. There wasn't any table available outside so we had to go inside, and afterwards, as planned, we showed my parents the  town, with my girlfriend just padding along in her bare feet.My parents were too polite to make a comment right then, but when they got home, they apparently made comments to my sister and other relatives about my \"grungy girlfriend\".I admit I blew up at my girlfriend afterwards. (I already apologised for my choice of words) I told her to dress appropriately for my conservative parents, and she just shows up to the restaurant barefoot. She says she just did not think about it when she left her apartment without shoes and also I am the AH for trying to control how she dresses. She says the visit went well and she thinks she and my parents got along well, but I just don't want to be \"grungy\" to be the first association my parents have with my long-term girlfriend.AITA for expecting her to know what's appropriate?Edit: since it has come up a couple of times in the comments, going barefoot is not the norm where I live. We're not exactly in a beachside town. Still, my girlfriend is far from the only one, and most of the population are students at the university anyways, so in essence, nobody in town really cares, which includes the restaurants. This is not in the US.Edit2: Okay, I read all comments, and I accept my judgement. I must admit, some of them hit close to home. I already apologised again to my girlfriend, for my outburst and for not standing up to my parents for her. I love her just how she is, and I overreacted because I really want this to work. I showed her this thread and we're both amused how the top comment is about how unrealistic it is for somebody to walk barefoot in a city (it's really more a town than a city, but still) ;)",

I know I should have confronted her, but given that she was part of the social circle (she was my friends housemate; lived in a large house at uni of 15 people) I didn't say anything, but I resented her.Anyway, I used that anger and hatred to motivate myself to study. I would pull all-nighters very often to prove people wrong. I fueled myself with hatred. As a result I got very good grades and got into a top university for my masters degree.Now I secured an internship at a pretty prestigious place. I've been on full bragging mode on my snapchat, posting snaps like ''I knew my doubters were dumb shits'' (I knew my doubters would see these snaps, so I was being intentionally inflammatory).I went back to my university city recently and saw my old friends who are still there.

I come along, we’re about to go, when my sister (9) pops up and asks if she can go. Of course, being her favorite, mom says yes. So we’re already late, and my mom has to go to work in 2 hours. We go shopping, I ask for stuff several times, she says no, whatever. But then, my sister asks for things, and, of course, being the favorite, gets them. This pisses me off, so “apparently” I end up being reckless with the groceries, when I am done unloading the car, I head up to my room. My mom confronts me, and I tell her I’m deprived of snacks and there’s nothing to snack on that I like. She gets angry, grounds me (actively sneaking this RN), and goes to work. I told the few friends I have about this, they are mixed on this, so that’s why I’m wondering, AITA?EDIT: for those pointing out that going to the store is not favoritism, here’s some other stuff: getting an iPod touch at the age of 4 (took me until I was 12.5, had to constantly ask my parents if I could use their devices), getting to go out and do stuff more often then I would’ve been allowed to, and, mom taking her side when I eat pizza she claimed 3 days ago but never touched (that happens quite often), later curfew (mine was 7:30, she gets to stay up till 9)EDIT 2: figured I'd get more support, guess not. but when you're used to eating a certain way for 15 years, only to throw away that entire lifestyle and have to adjust to a new one, no shit I'd complain. plan is to get a job, figure out WTF I'm gonna do with college, move out when I can, and just figure things out from there.EDIT 3: fuck all y'all \"I'm just a dumb kid\" MFs. I should be allowed to eat what I want to eat.EDIT 4: maybe I need a psyche analysis. I don't even know anymore...Edit 5: guess I’m the AH. But wow. These comments are toxic. I was hoping for some form of affirmation, but I guess not. Thank you to the (3? 5?)ish percent who were actually nice about it.EDIT 6/UPDATE: So, me and my mom had a talk. It did not go well. It was a long, heated argument. To summarize, I brought up a bunch of stuff (including things mentioned by you guys in my last post), she called me an ungrateful, spoiled brat, we kept arguing, things kept getting worse, I was sent to my room with no dinner (which sucks, dad was making steaks on the grill), and, as I’m typing this, am snacking on whatever leftovers in my room I have, chips, leftover Easter candy I never opened, anything goes",

	"body" : "My daughter asked me to post here to get an opinion as I don't think I have done anything wrong.I (55f) have a daughter (29f) \"Alex\". Alex has been in a relationship with her partner for 5 years and they live together, however recently Alex moved in with us as the roof in their old place collapsed and due to this they have ended their rent agreement early and are now looking for a new place. Alex is also paying a portion of our rent and bills and has her own room, but works in the dinning room as her own room doesn't have space for a desk.Since she has been living with us, she moved all her toys (gaming consoles and a laptop) with her and on more then one occasion I have noticed her gaming instead of working. I have made comments about it, but she said her work is really quiet at the moment and she has nothing to do while she is waiting, plus it helps her to relax. She would also take ages to come to the dinning room for dinner and when I ask her what she was doing Alex would say she was playing a game and she didn't see a problem in her delay since the food is still not ready (I don't like Alex in the kitchen as she always makes too much of a mess and makes very smelly food, so I have told her while she is under my roof I will handle the cooking). All of this has been bothering me and it makes me think she is addicted to the gaming, plus all her toys are taking way too much space.So yesterday while Alex was on a cinema date and gym with her partner, I have collected all her consoles, games and laptop and gave them to my other daughter and her son since she can't afford to buy a lot of nice things for my grandchild.Alex came home before me and after I returned I saw her in tears with her boyfriend trying to calm her down. When I asked her what is wrong she said she beliefs we were robbed as all her tech is missing, that's when I told her I gave it away as she was spending too much time gaming instead of working and is clearly an addict.Alex ended up shouting at me, calling me an asshole, saying I don't understand what I have done and if I don't return her \"toys\" she will file for theft since it cost more then 5k to replace it all and she doesn't have that kind of money. She has also mentioned it helps her with her depression and anxiety but I can't remember her being diagnosed with any of it. She has also packed all her things and left to stay with her boyfriend and his mother.",

One of the things that calms me down is hugging my stuffed animals, I have this one plush of a character from re zero who’s a really cute demon maid and her character is basically my comfort character.We were flying down to visit some relatives and I’ve never rode in a plane before and was really scared about it so I brought my rem plush to keep me calm. My mom saw me put it in my bag and told me to leave it and that it was embarrassing that I wanted to bring it. Well I took it anyways because i needed it and when we were on the plane I was freaking out after takeoff and we hit some turbulence and I was panicking so I took my plush out of my bag and was hugging it tightly which was helping until my mom saw it and took it away and after we landed she scolded me for going against her wishes and how it was extremely disrespectful and she’s embarrassed that someone might have seen. I feel so ashamed at myself rnEdit: idk how much this changes things but the reason I picked this plush to bring in particular was because it was a gift from my gf who passed and she brought me a lot of comfort when I needed it and in a way she still does",

	"title" : "AITA for attempting to destroy my husband's speakers?",
	"body" : "My m36 husband \"Tom\" is WFH and I f33 am a SAHM. While he's working he likes to listen to music on his speakers which I don't mind because we have similar tastes in music. Last month he started playing a new game.At first it wasn't a big deal when I could hear him playing during work, then after work, before bed, you get the point. The noises that this game makes are particularly annoying. Yet, for some reason our kids, Chloe 12 and Cris 10 started to love it just as much as he does.He always lowers the volume when I ask, which of course makes me the bad guy in the room until Cris raises the volume slowly over time and it's back again.Originally, this was a blessing. He plays with the kids while he works giving me a lot of time to do my own things. Everyone has been having a good time with it. I overhear Chloe and Cris suggesting things that they should do and Tom gets to teach them about his favorite things in the world, \"optimization\" and \"efficiency\".I've brought up my problem with this game a few times. Tom has suggested sound proofing the room which I feel is a bit extreme just because of me and this one game. Tom can't wear headphones, he breaks out in a ring where the headphones touch his head if he wears them for more than an hour or two. We've tried several different brands and materials in the past. He also has really bad tinnitus so he needs his sounds loud enough to drown it out.After this last weekend of pops and beeps, I couldn't take anymore. I waited until they left for ice cream, of course talking about you know what all the way there, then I took his speakers and cut the cable and threw them in the trash then ran myself a bath. It felt so good at first but then I found myself crying in the tub so ashamed at what I just did. I don't know why I broke like that.When they got back, Tom noticed the speakers missing and told the kids he needed to focus on some work before playing. He came to check on me in the bath. We talked about it and I cried and apologized for being such an AH, but I just couldn't take it anymore. He comforted me and when he was sure I was OK, he warmed up the water again and let me relax.When I got out, I saw him teaching the kids how to fix a broken wire. He told them that he accidentally frayed the cable by crushing it with his chair. I almost cried again.I feel like the AH here but I also don't feel like I had a choice.Edit: While money is not too tight, we are saving to move to a new place. While I know that Tom would pay for soundproofing the room, I know he doesn't completely like the idea. It's not efficient, after all. If anybody knows how to do sound proofing for cheap, I would love to look into that. We were under the impression that we would have to install another vent in the room, replace the doors and have work done inside of the walls and under the floor.",

Usually she works one or two days a week but this week she was working 4 days so we agreed to take it in turns to make dinner.She made dinner on Monday and Wednesday. I made dinner on Tuesday and Thursday.However, on Tuesday when she got in from work she was really salty from having to work that day. So even though I offered to make her whatever she wanted, she refused to have anything, so I just made dinner for myself. I warned her at the time she would be hungry later and a few hours later she complained she was hungry so I took her to McDonald's because I wanted her to eatOn Thursday we had a small argument because I snapped at her (my fault and I apologise for it) so she kept on insisting she wasn't hungry because she was mad at me. I offered to make whatever she wanted but again she refused. So after we made up I took us to pizza hut to make sure she ate.Today was her turn to make food, it's the first day she was scheduled to make food on a day she had been to work. She messaged me asking if it was ok if she could bring Greggs home because she didn't want to make anything.I wasn't happy with that because I had been looking forward to having jacket potato, watch was all pre-prepared, she just had to put it in the oven for 40 minutes and heat a tin of tikka masala. But I said I was fine with it.While I was waiting for her to get home, I fell asleep watching YouTube videos on my phone. She got home when I was sleeping, put a pizza square on my desk, didn't wake me or anything, and just went to bed.When I woke up the pizza was all gross and dry.So I asked her could she fix something else for dinner. She refused, she said she'd got take away, like I had, and it wasn't her problem I wasn't awake you eat it.I told her that I got takeaway as a last resort because I didn't want her to be hungry after she'd refused everything I offered to make for her and I made sure she was awake when we got it.She still refused to make dinner so I told her she was lazy and being a bad girlfriend because I cared enough about her to make sure she ate when it was my turn to make dinner but she couldn't be bothered to extend be the same courtesy.",

	"body" : "Okay, just gonna start off by saying this is probably going to be pretty low stakes, it's reasonably likely she'll laugh it off, but just in case, let's assume a worst case scenario where she cuts contact. Now, on to the story.So, my cousin got married a bit over a year ago. For the first dance, the band played a song that has a title (for the sake of simplicity, we'll call the song \"Zoe\") that rhymes with my cousin's name (who we'll call Chloe), so they used her name in place of the song's actual title. I don't want to say the actual names, since I can't think of any other names that rhyme with the two, and I don't want anyone figuring out who this is about on the off-chance someone else here was at that wedding.Anyway, as soon as the band said they were replacing \"Zoe\" with \"Chloe\", I had to put on my poker face because I knew the song was about something...kinda bad. In short, it's about alcoholism and committing crime. To the casual listener, it's hard to notice due to the upbeat nature of the song, it's when you actually look at the lyrics you realise what it's about. (I will not be confirming or denying if anyone figures out the song, so don't ask).Anyway, I didn't say anything at the wedding, because I know damn well what a bad idea it is to ruin a bride's big day. I'm just not sure if it would make me an AH to ever mention it, potentially ruining the memory of Chloe's wedding.So Reddit, WIBTA?",

But I have to give a little context.The Neighborhood I live in has the best school district in our state because of the high property tax. So the High School in my neighborhood is really nice. So nice that it just got a 2.2 million dollar renovation recently. Because the schools are so great families will temporarily move into our Neighborhood to send there kids to school and my friend happens to be in one of those families.Recently he had a job opening at his dad’s car shop and asked our friend group if any of us wanted to wrap cars. Most of our friend group said no because they already had jobs but one other person and me. I told him I’d love to because I was in between jobs at the moment. He told me no straight to my face in a very blunt way. I was taken aback and asked him why. He said it was because of my job performance at a work interview recently. Other friend had a job opening at a WingStop and I didn’t do very well. I tried to explain to him why my performance was bad.I started to say that it was bad because the women interviewing me didn’t like me. It was my first time working at a chicken place and I didn’t eat there regularly. So during the work interview I keep confusing different sauce flavors and kept messing up. During my explanation he cut me off and just said “No”. He said “I just don’t want you there messing shit up”. At that moment I got mad and said the meanest thing I could think of at him. I said “If you dad was a better business owner you family would still live here”. At that moment he ran up to me yelling. Other friend held him back. I was still angry so I kept going. I said “Your family paid all that money just for you to end up like your dad”. (He didn’t go to college and planned to work for his dad). At the moment he screamed at me to get out and I left.Honestly I don’t feel like what I said was that bad but he’s stopped talking to me and my friends are tell me to apologize.So AITA?(Edited for spelling errors)",

So I called the friend and said never mind don’t come.I doze off then here a knock at my door a few hours later. When I opened the door there she stood. We started off just talking but one thing led to another. Six days later she calls and says she’s pregnant. I said well that’s impossible you can’t get a positive test from us in six days.Years go by, and I have gained custody of one of my kids. I’m at the child support office and they hand me a paper then say I have to take a paternity test. I see the paper has my sisters friends name on it, dates three years ago. I ask the child support worker “why am I just getting this and I’ve came here numerous times over the years? Well the test came back positive I was the daddy.The court then slaps me with over $27,000 in child support debt. I’m already broke so this baffled me. Well I have paid over $21,500 to her since the order but only for current support. In that time she has only let me see my child for 1 hour on a drive by visit. Wont give me her address and won’t let my child come stay over.The court is taking me to trial for non payment of the back support and said they will put me in jail. I call her and say please waive the back support I’ve gave you a lot of money, and you only let me see my child for one hour in nine years. She refuses and say you need to ask your wife for money to pay it. She calls me an ahole for asking her to waive it so I don’t go to jail. I tell her I have never had $30,000 at one time so I am never going to be able to pay it. Its hurting my credit and I can’t even get a loan to pay you. It’s crazy the child support court said we don’t enforce child visitation we only deal with money. That’s not fair. Is she right?AITA for asking her to waive the back child support so I don’t go to jail.",
