	"title" : "AITA for “ruining Christmas” and being upset the only gifts I got from my family were “joke gifts”",
	"body" : "Some background, my family likes to play pranks with Christmas and birthday gifts it’s nothing new. I (f21) as well as my 5 siblings (from 29 to 37 years old) have all been pranked on our birthdays and on Christmas and usually it’s one or two gifts. This Christmas though, I was the only person to get all joke gifts. For example, I unwrapped a MacBook from my brother, but when I opened it, it was just some chocolate (which I don’t eat so I gave it away) and the MacBook was actually given to my sister inside a bag she wanted. Another “gift” was what I thought was a book I put on my Christmas list was actually just the book cover put on a dictionary. When I asked my mom about the book she told me she gave it to my SilThis went on with each present my siblings or parents had given me. AirPods was just a charger block? Adapter? gift cards were used and had $0 balance, a card with Monopoly money, and so on totaling to about 12 joke gifts. I realized I went out of my way to get everyone something they wanted or they’d like didn’t get anything. At this point i was bummed so I went to the living room to watch tv with my boyfriend. At dinner they were all talking about how much they loved their gifts and when my dad asked why I hadn’t said anything about mine, I said there wasn’t much to say. Everyone but my boyfriend laughed and my mom said it was no big deal as everyone else also got some joke gifts. I told her every gift I got was a joke gifts and that the ones they got was also followed by the real one. My dad told me I needed to relax as I’m making a big deal about it and I’d have next Christmas to get the stuff on my list.Not wanting to go back and forth i told my boyfriend I wanted to leave and we can spend the rest of Christmas break with his family then go home. My family got mad and told me not to go and to just stay because it wasn’t serious. I left and put my phone on do not disturb during the drive and by the time we got to bf’s parent’s house, I had several missed calls and texts from them calling me names like ungrateful, sensitive, and childish. They said I ruined Christmas and made my parents upset cause I left. The next day, I exchanged and opened gifts with my boyfriend and his family and one of the gifts I had gotten was the book I wanted (the book my mom pretended to gift me). I posted it on my instagram story and not even 0 minutes after posting it, my sister sent a screenshot of my story to the family group chat and they basically got mad at me for leaving and telling me I ruined Christmas over some presents. They told me I owe everyone, especially my parents, an apology because my mom spent new years sad because of my actions. Now I just want an outside party to tell me if I’m TA here? Am I in the wrong for being upset about the gifts and for leaving? After reading their messages and sitting on this for a few days I’m now feeling like maybe I was upset over nothing and need to apologize to them.*Gonna edit as there may have been some misunderstanding, my Christmas list didn’t include expensive gifts nor was I upset I didn’t receive expensive gifts. I was merely upset because of being pranked with everything I got and being the only person who didn’t get a real present that is all. Another thing I’ll address is I dint do anything to my family which would warrant them doing this. The last “big argument” I had was with my sister which was over a year and a half ago. Thank you for the replies and I will try my best to reply to comments while I’m at work. Editing once more to add I participated in joke gifts when I was a kid, haven’t participated in the last 10+ years because I didn’t enjoy it or find if funny (which thy do know). I will reply with more info if needed when I’m on break or have time to reply. - and I am familiar with the term scapegoat but truthfully don’t fully understand so I will research that as well.",

	"body" : "I45f have a 27 year old daughter. She has 6 kids, between the ages 10-11 months.  There are 3 different fathers, she receives child support from 2 of them, and she is still with the 3rd one and they have been for 5 years.  My daughter works part time, and her fiancé is a chef full time. They have lived with us for the past year and a half, due to getting evicted from their last home. The kids and them have our upstairs bedrooms (there’s 2) but that’s still crowded for 6 children. They are constantly asking me for help with phone bills, My husband and I have asked for no rent so they’d be able to save money to get a home, which I do not believe they were doing.I have put up with loud voices through out all hours, and waking up at different hours to cater to children, because I love my grandchildren. I never complained to my daughter because I believe family is very important. It’s just that my children are all grown up, my youngest moved out 4 years ago and my husband and I had hopes to remodel. We didn’t expect them to be living here this long.On Christmas Eve, my daughter gathered us all around and announced they were pregnant with baby #7. Everyone was all excited, but I felt dread. That would mean another child in our house with not much room. I looked over at my husband and could tell he felt the same, we discussed later and decided we were going to have to ask them to move out.Last night at dinner I brought it up to my daughter and her boyfriend and we told them, they have 2 months to find a place because we cannot have another child here. My daughter started crying, saying she couldn’t believe I’d throw her to the streets for having a baby, that this was completely unfair and not enough time. I told her I was sorry, it was painful for me as well, but these living conditioners were impossible. She demanded I give her more time or she’d go to the courts and I told her news flash, the courts only gives you 30 days. She then said my grandchildren were going to be homeless because I was selfish. She made a Facebook post asking for rooms to rent because “she’s pregnant and has nowhere to go and her family don’t give a sh*t about her.” AITA?",

	"body" : "My sister 26 has been on and off out of the hospital. I am going to call my sister Anna. Anna got cancer when she was 15 and was able to beat it. Ever since she has been having growths and anytime one appears we are worried about the cancer coming back.My issue is that she always makes these announcements that she needs to go to the doctors again at the worst times. At the beginning I thought it was just bad timing but it has happened so many time when I hit a milestone. My graduations, my birthdays, my engagement party. Anytime she makes an announcement she needs to go back to the hospital my whole family with flock to her.I have had my birthday dinner turn into my relatives flocking to her for the whole night.I had a dinner party to announce my wedding  date for my relatives. It was going so great and it was a fun time until Anna told mom she needs to go back to the hospital. Soon everyone forgot about the reason for the dinner party and it was quiet. My aunt even stepped in to do a pray for Anna. Another event was taken over. I went low contact with her after that.She was invited to the wedding and it is in two weeks. I learned today she is in a on and off in a wheelchair from my mom/Anna. She will need to take it just in case for the wedding. I asked if the rest of the family was informed and she told me no. I told both of them they need to inform them. They told me they don’t want to worry them and won’t do that.I had enough and told them you need to tell before my wedding. Again a no. I then informed them Anna is not invited.This started a huge argument about how I’m a dick and my point is that I am sick of her stealing the spotlight. That what will happen if she rolls in with a wheelchair.Edit: I’m going to do a mass blast to all my relatives, saying she is in a wheelchair and unsure if she will be able to make it to my wedding, keep my sister in their thoughts and prayers.I’m gettin ahead of this.",

	"body" : "I post my food pics from when I go out to eat on Instagram. It's just for fun, I spend like 30 minutes a week on it, tops. My boyfriend is a very sweet guy in many ways, but one thing that I'm not so much a fan of is that he often hops on the bandwagon of hating on innocent things. Not just not liking something, but making sure everyone knows he doesn't like it even if nobody asked. I can't help but notice a theme: Pumpkin spice lattes, pouty selfies, Taylor Swift, etc. As you can guess, he is not a fan of of the food pics and thinks it's very annoying and cringe. He doesn't even follow my insta even though he has an account :(Even though I don't have very many followers, I have started getting occasional offers and invitations from restaurants in my city to try their food for free in exchange for a review. Nothing crazy—no steak dinners so far—but I've gotten a few sandwiches and several baked goods.Well, I just hit the big leagues and got invited to a new restaurant opening that includes a free appetizer and entree for me and one guest. I immediately invited one of my Instagram friends who I have gone out to eat with on several occasions and who also enjoys taking food photos. I told my boyfriend and he's pissed that I'm not taking him and says I'm doing it out of spite—I really think I'm not? If the restaurant is giving me free food in exchange for a post, I'm gonna put more effort into the post and spend a few extra minutes making sure that I actually get very good shots, and I'd rather do it with someone who isn't going to sigh and roll their eyes through the whole thing. Also, I think it's pretty audacious of him to be actively unsupportive of an activity that hurts no one, but then also expects to benefit when it's actually successful.",

Mark doesn't want my mom to work but he also doesn't give her money for us because thats our dads job so I was kinda on my own to get anything I needed.A guy at my school noticed I don't have a lunch most of the time so he started bringing extra food for me then I started going to his house after school. They've been really nice to me. They take me out with them and they got me pair of shoes because mine were too small.They went all out for me for Christmas. I got 2 pairs of boots and another 2 pairs of shoes, 6 pairs of jeans, 4 leggings, like 20 shirts, 2 jackets, a raincoat, rain boots, umbrella, new backpack and water bottle and even hair stuff and some makeup. They also got me glasses but that wasn't really a Christmas present.My mom took everything back for store credit and she used it to get herself stuff. My friends dad picked me up the day after Christmas to take me to camp (he signed me and my friend up for cooking camp during winter break) and I told him what happened. He called cps and they came to camp to talk to me a couple days later then they came to the house and now I'm staying with my friend and his dad. He reordered everything he got me plus he had me go into target and some other stores to get a couple things until everything gets here but my mom is really mad that I told him and she's saying I got her in a lot of trouble so I wanted to know if I was wrong for telling him that she returned everything.",

I'm no contact with mine.My mother in law has been referring to the baby as \"her\" baby this entire time. She will say things like \"I can't wait for my baby to be born.\" \"My baby is going to be so loved.\" This rubs me the wrong way for reasons I cannot explain, but my husband tells me to ignore her.My MIL wanted to throw me a baby shower and invite her friends. She said they made an agreement a long time ago that they would celebrate each other's kids' weddings and births. My husband and I eloped and declined a reception for her friends since we don't know them. My MIL told me that I owed it to her to let her throw the baby shower since I hurt her friends' feelings by not having wedding reception. I asked if I could invite my friends, and she said no, that this was for her friends, and that if my friends wanted to throw me a shower they could. I reluctantly agreed.My husband and I spent hours on our registry, and my MIL asked for it so she could share with her friends. She said she forwarded the registry on. She asked me what design I wanted on my cake and cookies. I told her flowers because I am decorating the nursery in a garden theme.At the shower they provided me with a \"mother to be\" sash and my MIL a \"granny to be\" sash to wear. I noticed that the theme of the shower was circus animals. The cake had an elephant and balloons on it, and the cookies were animals. At first I thought that maybe the floral theme was just too difficult, so I rolled with it until it was time to open presents.Every present was some sort of circus animal. Onesies, blankets, toys - nothing on my registry. I was a little confused and even went so far to check my registry to make sure I hadn't goofed up and changed everything. I thanked everyone for their gifts and tried to sound as gracious as possible, but I was so confused.My husband, who is a little less tactful than I am, showed up at the end of the shower and noticed the theme right away. He goes \"what's up with all the circus animals?\" He looks at the presents and says, \"This isn't what we asked for.\" Then he looked at his mom and goes \"MOM. What did you do?\"She smiled and said, \"I didn't like the theme you chose for my baby. I'm going to decorate my baby's nursery at my house with circus animals, so I created a registry for myself.\" My husband said, \"YOU DID WHAT?\" She says, \"My baby is going to need a room at my house so I threw a shower for myself.\"I lost my composure and told her that she would not see MY baby and to stop calling the baby hers, and my husband told his mom that she's delusional if she thinks we're going to allow this. She started crying and said we are just withholding her baby from her.We've been getting texts from his family since the shower, calling us selfish and ungrateful and saying we ruined her joy of being a grandma.Are we the AH?",

I got up out of seat and walked out. It’s been 2 days since the wedding and my husband cursed me out for not letting them have a special moment. I responded with “I wanted the day to be about us because it’s our wedding not theirs and I am happy for them but the worst thing was even though I said no you went behind my back about it.”Since that argument he moved to the guest bedroom and now most of my friends are cursing me out on all my socials.

	"title" : "AITA for not telling my former fiancé I bought her dream house?",
	"body" : "10 years ago, my fiancé left me (38m) a few weeks before our wedding. We grew up in a small town. We were friendly, went to the same school, but we never were in the same clique. She was one of the popular kids and I wasn’t.A few years after college, I moved back home when my dad got sick. I found a job in my field about 45 minutes away from home. I would help take my dad to his chemo appointments. It was during one of those appointments I ran into EX.  She was now a worked at the hospital. One day while waiting, I asked her out.It turned out we shared a lot of the same interests. It seemed like our relationship was going great. About a year or so into dating EX and I moved into a rented house together. The following year, I proposed. We began looking for a house. EX always wanted to live in her grandparents’ house on the lake near our town. Her family was forced to sell house when her grandparents died because of an inheritance dispute. 6 months before our wedding, a chance event happened. The couple who bought her grandparents lake house had grown tired of our snowy winters. It took some work and nearly all of my savings, but I was able to buy her dream house. It was going to be my surprise wedding present so I didn’t dare tell her or anyone in her family my plans.A month before our wedding, EX and her friends went to Miami for her bachelorette party. I am not sure all of what happened there, part of me doesn’t really want to know, but I do know her high school BF was there. When she got back, from the trip, she broke down and confessed she was afraid to get married and wanted to call it off. It was a mess. She later moved to Florida and eventually married HS BF.I ended up moving back to the city for an amazing job. In the meantime, I still had the lake house. With the help of my mom and dad, we started to fix up the lake house. It took a few years. My mom and dad would look after the contractors while I was in the city. Having the house was perfect when the everything locked down. I was able to escape the city and work remotely from the lake house. I now live here full time and work remotely.This summer we had 4th of July at the Lake House. My SIL used photos from the lake this summer in her Christmas card. One of those cards made it to EX’s cousin. The cousin recognized the house. The Saturday before new year’s EX’s Mother and Sister were at my front door. After pleasantries and answering their initial questions, they made an offer to buy it. I refused. They were not happy.A few days I got a long txt from EX. This was the first time in about 9 years she has talked with me. She called me an ass for keeping this from her. Her family is blaming her for losing the house again. She then asked me sell. I still have no intention to sell. Now her and her family are complaining on social media that this is some sort of revenge. AITA?",

She is vegetarian and at one point tried to go vegan.My son and her never hosted due to living in a small apartment but that changed since they have just bought a home. They are having a dinner this week and I called her to remind her I am allergic to nuts. She then informed me that she doesn’t doenst have time and to bring my own food.

My allergy is not life threatening, if it was going to kill me I wouldn’t be okay with any of the dishes having nuts, I just asked for one that I can eat. I can be at a table with nuts it’s fine.This actually personally annoys me, allergic reactions are a spectrum from very mild to kill you.Also for everyone saying allergies get worse every time people have it are incorrect, some allergies can be improved through exposure therapy which is usually done at a doctors.

Before we left, his cousin warned me about MIL, he said she wasn't nicest person, and she had impossibly high standards to meet and can be judgemental, so don't take it personally, as she's like that with everyone. I did ask my husband and he agreed that MIL can be quite judgemental, but not to worry, that he will be there for me. I felt like they gave me the sugar coated version of her because she was terrible. She made a scene about bringing a stranger to a family furneral, but my husband cut her off and said his aunt, who was his uncle widow said he could. She spent the rest off the furneral giving me nasty looks and making passive aggressive comments. She made a scene at our wedding, but that's a different story on it's own.But after minimal contact with MIL my husband eventually got around to telling her that I was pregnant. I expected her to be angry and have a go at him. But she surprised us both and was the complete opposite. She was excited about being a grandmother. She was congratulating us. Her attitude did a complete turn and I grudgingly allowed her to visit. When it was time to give birth to my son, she wanted to see my son being born, but I refused. That's when her ugly side rared it's head again and she caused a scene and was thrown out. I refused to let her visit us at home, my husband agreed. But she rang crying and apologizing. She said she was just overwhelmed about being a grandmother and her emotions got the better of her.Against my better judgement, I relented and said okay. When she first held him she looked at me and said he was beautiful! I went into the kitchen to get us a drink and then I could hear my husband telling her to get out! I went back in, she started yelling he needed to get baby tested because he doesn't look like anyone in their family. He kicked her out. She took to SM and told everyone that I cheated on my husband and that my husband needs to get a DNA test to prove he was the dad. She got alot off attention for that. So I made my own post and said I'll get a test when she gets test for her son! That just made everything worse! She rang my husband up telling him to take it down. He just hung up on her.

	"body" : "My little brother recently moved in with me. It was a huge shock at first, my brother (Will, 17) is FTM. I (M34) had no idea he was trans or even questioning his gender, he always seemed perfectly happy as a girl, y'know he was very feminine presenting and all. Turns out he came out to our parents after getting his hair cut and they didn't take it well in the slightest.From what he's told me, he wasn't exactly kicked out, they just started being unbearable. They were calling him 'Myla' in every sentence they said (just to annoy him i suppose), mum kept booking him in for appointments to get hair extensions and his lashes done, our da didn't let him wear the male uniform to sixth form and so on.It got so bad that he literally took a train from down south to up the north to ask if he could live with me. Of course, I said yes. The house is big enough to have him live there, there's four bedrooms and an attic room.My girlfriend (Nico, 32) was irritated when she found out. We've discussed her moving in before Will came and now she's telling me that she will not move in until Will leaves. I've explained to her that Will isn't a child we'd have to constantly supervise, that if anything he's the one making the place more liveable (he's very insistent on adding on to the home decor and so on, as well as being better than me at cleaning.), and that the house is large enough to still have privacy even with him around.Nico's argued that it's not truly 'ours' if Will is always there, that we won't be able to start trying to concieve, that she's not willing to live with a 'hormonal and rebellious' teenager and that she's just flat out uncomfortable with Will being near her and living with her and her son (M10) in the same home.Ultimately, I've told her that my loyalties lie with my baby brother, who is homeless and vulnerable, unlike the grown woman with a good paying job and a home of her own. She's called my mum up to complain about it and she's said that i was in the wrong for prioritizing Will, and Will himself said that he doesn't want to be 'causing problems' in my relationship.update : https://www.reddit.com/user/mourrningglory/comments/19aubaa/aita_for_telling_my_gf_my_loyalties_lie_with_my/",

	"body" : "I was at a bookstore last night after work. When I got to the register, it was empty. A moment later, an employee came back around with another customer. The other customer got in line behind me, while still chatting with the employee. I could tell the employee was a little uncomfortable as she called me forward. The other customer stood literally right behind me as the employee kept doing the brush off of “yeah” “oh really?” “Wow”.The other customer was talking about how she had recently been diagnosed with cancer, going into details about the treatments she’d need, etc. Finally, she was quiet when it was clear the employee was focused on my transaction and trying to ask me the whole “do you have a rewards card, do you want one, etc.” spiel. That’s when the other customer turned to me and started giving the same story. I said I was sorry to hear about her diagnosis and went back to speaking to the employee. The customer still kept talking, right in my ear, saying “yeah, I’m so pissed, why’d this have to happen to me?”Finally, I told her “you need to back up and give me some space. Stop interrupting our conversation.” She started saying “I have cancer, I need to vent”. I said “again, sorry to hear that but we are not your therapists, back up”. She backed up and went silent. Employee looked relieved.I told my wife what happened and she told me I was rude. The woman was clearly going through something. I said as a former retail worker, I despised people who unloaded their days on me and she was clearly making the employee uncomfortable while also standing right next to me. Wife said I was still wrong.AITA?",

Upon learning of Kelly Ann’s situation and how my husband and I plan to adopt her, my sister told me a few days after that we should start telling Kelly Ann to call herself Kelly instead of her middle name. She said 2 Ann in the family will be confusing so Kelly Ann needs to get used to being Kelly.My husband said she was being ridiculous and if anything it’s her baby that needs renaming because Kelly Ann has been calling herself Ann for years. My sister argued that she has announced her baby’s name many months ago and we only planned to adopt Kelly Ann recently, so we should be the one making her rethink how to call herself.

	"title" : "AITA for pretending \"I didn’t know I was adopted\" to make my teacher embarrassed?",
	"body" : "Edit: TLDR at end.Posting on throwaway because there’s enough info you could figure out on my main if you know me.Ok so I’m in high school and this was in my english class. Our real teacher is on paternity leave and we have a long term substitute. So yesterday she was telling us she wants us to write personal memoirs about something very important in our lives, and she goes about listing various examples for different students. She told me I could write about being adopted and how I felt when my parents told me.Now I must have made a face then, because I’m not adopted. I have two dads but they had me through surrogacy. So technically there was a legal adoption for my non-bio dad, but one of my dads is my bio dad, and my bio “mom” is my other dads sister who donated her egg and carried me. I think it would be a stretch to call me adopted, also the sub has no basis to even know any of this because as much as I’ve written in class is just that I have two dads.Anyway, she’s kinda old school and doesn’t like when we talk too loud (which to her is talking at a normal indoor level on group assignments), make any normal faces, and whatever. She basically called me out on making a face and was like “OP if you don’t want to write about being adopted you can choose another important topic to your life, maybe how you help your dad at home?” (one of my dads has cerebral palsy and is mostly blind from optic neuropathy, I did write briefly about that in the intro assignment with our other teacher so he must have left them with her to get to know the class).I was confused so I said “I’m not adopted.”She just put her hand over her heart and goes “oh, honey.”So now my brain which was lagging caught up and I realize she’s only thinking I’m adopted because I have two dads. So at this point I’m like whatever, I’ll just play into it, so I look upset and I’m like “I didn’t know I was adopted!”She’s kind of panicking a bit and telling everyone to just start writing something. A lot of my friends are laughing under their breath because they know I’m not adopted so she’s telling everyone quiet down and it’s not funny and to get to work. I’m like “what do you mean I’m adopted?”She’s trying to tell me not to worry about it and just ask my dads when I get home. And I’m like “how can I be adopted?” So she just sends me to the school counselor, and I told her this story basically and she basically gave off the vibe that it was a shitty thing to mess with the sub that way and I could have just explained I’m not adopted because now I’ve made her worry unnecessarily and embarrassed her. I don’t think parts of my life are up to her to decide what I want to share or not, and I feel like its on her if she feels embarrassed for assumptions she made, maybe that makes me the asshole?TLDR. Teacher assumed I'm adopted because I have two dads. I pretended to be upset like I'm learning for the first time, from her, that I'm adopted. Btw I'm not adopted, dads had me though surrogacy.",

My sister had to take him home. Dove was understandably agitated and was now wary on who comes near her pups.I had decided over a couple of day's that I didn't trust Dion to have one of them.

The best news was that it was on clearance for $100 so I bought it without a second thought. I have worn it several times last year but it hasn’t been cold enough this year for me to break out the coat. Last week when I saw the news about the upcoming cold front, I decided it was time to take it to the dry cleaners so that I can wear it this week.After tearing all my closets apart without seeing it, I asked my fiance if she had seen it. She told me that she haven’t seen me wear it in awhile so she lent it to her brother to wear to a wedding. I was annoyed at hearing this but decided not to make a big deal so I simply told her to tell her brother to bring it back so I could get it dry cleaned. Thursday rolls around and he hasn’t brought it back so I asked her about it again, nothing. Come Friday, and i haven’t heard anything so I called him. He said that he told my wife on Tuesday that he got drunk at the wedding and lost my coat. I was super annoyed at this so I told him he owes that exact coat from that exact brand.Last night my fiance came home from work in a mood and handed me $100. She said that her brother dropped off the money and I shouldn’t have made her brother pay for the coat since I knew he doesn’t make very much and I haven’t worn it but a handful of times. I looked at the $100 and told her I wanted a replacement coat or the amount it currently cost so that I can buy a new one and that $100 won’t cover it. She said he went to the store and it cost $700 now but she knew I only paid $100 for it so she told him $100 would cover the cost. I argued that $100 doesn’t buy me a new coat. We went back and forth but couldn’t find any common ground. She offered to throw in an extra $100 of her own money and said sarcastically that I’m coming out ahead. I argued that I’m still out a coat and nothing will satisfy my lost except for a replacement coat. She argued that I don’t have to have the exact coat and that I can buy a similar one with $200.She thought I was being ridiculous and called her parents on speaker phone. Of course they sided with their children and her dad tried to say that a man shouldn’t be so hung up on a coat. I told him that a man replaces what he loses. So now they’re all mad at me for wanting to make a profit from their son and intimating that he’s not a man.Am I wrong for wanting the same coat as a replacement?",

Apparently they have a longstanding tradition where instead of drawing straws, they’ll throw all their underwear in a bin and then go act take turns wearing a blindfold and drawing a pair of underwear from the pile, and drawing the smallest pair of underwear correlates to drawing the smallest straw.I had never heard of this tradition, so I felt blindsided when right before Christmas dinner, my fiancés mom yelled out that it was time to « pull the straws » to decide the order of who got to plate up their food first in case there wasn’t enough for everyone.At first I thought the family was joking when they announced this, so I laughed, which made my fiancé get real defensive. I volunteered to get my food last, so I wouldn’t have to participate, but my fiancé just got more annoyed and asked me to just try to be a bit more agreeable.The whole thing was just kind of weirding me out, so I called an Uber and went home.

It is the biggest house in the family so we often host family gatherings.My husband’s youngest sister Jane (31f) has been traveling for work ever since her early 20’s. Mid 2022 she moved in with her fiancé about half a hour drive away from us. After that Jane shows up regularly at family gatherings and rebuilds relationships with her family members. The only thing she never bothers to do is address my daughters by their names.Amy and Nina are identical twins. I understand when people refer to them as “the twins” but I think it is important that their individuality is respected. I always tell family and friends that now that they are 6 years old it is important for them to have their own identity and if possible please treat them as individual rather than a pair or a unit. My girls have different interests and hair/dressing styles so it is not hard to tell them apart.Jane always insists on calling the girls “the twins” and makes no effort to distinguish them. I asked her many times to treat them as individuals, like her other nieces and nephews, and Jane would say OK and then keep doing the same thing.Last Christmas Amy made paper cranes and Nina painted flower pictures as their Christmas gifts to everyone in the family. They signed their names and individually handed the gift to everyone. Jane’s fiancé had to work this year and did not join us so after brunch she video called him in the living room while the rest of us did our things nearby. Her fiancé saw the crane in her hand and asked where she got it and Jane said “Oh, one of the twins gave it to me for Christmas. The other twin drew some flowers.”I felt that this was a disrespect as my girls put a lot of effort into the gifts and deserve to have their private dedication recognized. When everyone left, I told Jane I expected her to call my girls Amy and Nina from now on and to treat them like individual and know their differences. Jane said that she won’t bother as my girls are too young. So I told her she is banned from my house until she learns how to address my girls by their names. Jane just stomped off. My husband agreed with me on this.A few days ago my MIL called to plan my husband’s birthday in early February. I told her we could have the party at my house like usual but Jane would not be invited. My MIL was alarmed and asked why and when she learned of what happened she was mad at Jane. Jane called me a few hours ago calling me AH for making a big deal out of something insignificant. She said my girls would be known as the twins whether I like it or not and once they get older people WILL recognize them as individuals but not now when they’re young and “just another couple of girls.” She said she deserves to be with her family for her brother’s birthday and I need to let it go.

	"body" : "The background starts with my mom dying. I (17F) was 11 and my sister's were 16 and 18. Our dad met his second wife a couple of years later (when I was 13). The expectations for my relationship with her and my sister's were very different. My sister's were expected to be civil but if they weren't close it was no big deal. But almost everyone (minus my sisters and minus my mom's family) expected me to see my dad's wife as some second mother or maternal/parental figure. They got married when I was 14.My dad's wife wanted me to divide Mother's Day between my sisters and maternal side with her. My sisters were not expected to do the same. But she would say she wanted to celebrate the day with her kid.She signed us up for mother/daughter things. She would get hurt when I didn't want to go and would never ask my sister's. I asked her before why she expected me to do these things with her but she never invited my sisters. She said she was raising me and wanted to be a mother presence in my life but they were grown. I told her (and my dad on separate occasions) that I didn't want or need and wouldn't accept someone else into that kind of figure. I was ignored.I had a small run in with my sisters when dad was getting married because I said he shouldn't and they said he should be allowed to move on and mom would want him happy. When I explained what was going on they realized why I was feeling that way. They tried talking to dad but it did no good.My dad's side of the family would all make comments that I was lucky to have another mother figure, or how I don't seem to give her the care and consideration she deserves. They would ask why I seemed to spend no time with her of my own free will. Or why I was never loving toward her.My dad told me I should show her more love and affection and he told me I made her feel left out when I didn't tell her stuff or when I made plans with others but not her.I know some people would love to have someone like this in their lives. But I want the same relationship my sisters have with her. But more is expected.So Christmas Day came and everyone was at our house for Christmas (minus my mom's family). My dad and his wife gave me a card \"from my parents\" and my sisters got them with \"dad and his wife\". Then when it became time for family photos we got one with the three of us and dad but then my grandparents wanted me in the family one with my dad and his wife but my sisters weren't expected to be in it. I tried to step out and my dad's wife said it wasn't a family photo without their kid.This was the point where I lost it and I told her I am not her kid, she is not my mother figure, that she is dad's wife just like she is to my sisters and I want it to be that way. I said I do not love her and hate how they all treat her like she suddenly became a parent to me. My sisters were on my side but my dad was furious and his wife cried and cried harder as I continued.AITA?",

We also use it for out of town guests.Trudi and her husband ran into some financial problems last year. Trudi and her family of four moved in with us. We agreed that after the holidays I would stop taking reservations for my apartment and they could move in there. They would sign a lease and we would \"rent\" it to them without collecting rent so they could build up rental history and money.Trudi moved in last October. It was hell. She doesn't help around the house and neither do her kids. Her husband is working his ass off to get money together for them so he comes home exhausted. And he is more help than her or their kids.

My apartment is now empty since the holidays are over. I said I didn't want them treating my property like they were treating my husband's home.They are all mad at me for leaving and changing the plan.

	"body" : "So I (21F) went to my grandads (80M) house last week and he handed me a jar full of cash with my name on it. He told me to count it and it came to £3200. I asked him what it was for and he explained the rules of the game he'd been playing with the whole family:From the 1st of December 2023, to the 31st December 2023, everytime a member of the family visited him, he'd put £100 in their jar for every hour they spent with him. At the end of the month, the person who spent the most time with him would receive all of the money in their jar, and the others would get nothing. He obviously didn't tell anybody that he was doing this so that no one spent extra time with him to get the money.I won his \"game\" by £600, so 6 hours more than the person who came second (my uncle).At first I didn't want to accept the money, only because I didn't think it was right to play games with people without them knowing, especially not your family. But after a while he convinced me to take my prize money because I \"earned it\".When I got home, I told my parents about the money and explained his game to them. I told my mum where she came on the scoreboard (4th) and she was understandably upset at her father for making us unknowingly compete with each other. Then she told the rest of the family via a group chat.So now pretty much my whole family is mad at my grandad for doing this, but also me for accepting the money. He is an old man and he's not exactly a millionaire, so they think that I should have refused the money and confronted him for what he did. I think that if he was willing to play this game then he obviously has no problem with giving the money away, and he did insist on me taking it. Also, he's always been a weird guy, so although I don't agree with what he did, I'm not too surprised, so I don't think I should have had to start an argument with him about it.Edit: sorry I didn't make it clear enough, this took place between December 1st and December 31st of last year, so only lasting one month. Each person who visited him had a separate jar, so my jar had £3200 in it because I spent 32 hours with him. Other people had different amounts in their jars, but I only received what was in mine.  :)Another Edit: Thank you for all of the responses so far. I've seen a lot of comments about how his game was unfair because some people have more free time. That's completely true, although in this case, don't assume that just because I'm young, I have more free time. I have a full time job, a partner, and a small side business to run, I have significantly less free time than most of my family, apart from maybe my uncle, who works slightly more hours than me. The majority of my family work part time or not at all, and only my aunt has a young kid to attend to, but she doesn't work either. I'm not saying the game was fair, but I think most of my family would not have trouble finding the spare time to spend with him, some would just rather be doing anything else :/",

	"body" : "My friend 39f June brought her 8yo son Steven over to my house today. June and I were just chatting over a cup of tea when there was a scream from the kitchen and we rushed to find that Steven had tried to eat a whole macadamia nut with shell. For context the nut is a white nut surrounded by the hardest and most smooth chocolate looking shell you've ever seen. He'd obviously thought it was chocolate and tried to eaten it from a closed Tupperware Container on the kitchen island (Was going to cracking them with a hammer later). My friend first admonished Steven for eating something obviously not meant for him and took him to emergency dental where she later learned he has cracked one of his molars and it was apparently quite bad. Apparently as its still his first set of teeth they will just be pulling it out but she wants me to pay for at least half as it was my macadamia and it was on the kitchen island and accessible. aita",

	"body" : "So this has been a long thing coming. My soon to be husband has a sister let’s call her Mia. Now Mia and I do not click very well. I am polite but I wouldn’t say we are friends. I felt I was forced by his family to make her a bridesmaid or she will be sad.I am going to be blunt, Mia is fat and very insecure about it. This has led bridesmaid dresses shopping to be a nightmare. Never could find something she wants and all the other bridesmaid and me liking it. So I gave everyone two options to vote on. Option one was getting a dress that can be styled multiple ways, or picking from a collection so everyone matches but they will need to pay for it. Option two was I will buy everyone’s dress but what I chose the dress and my decision is final.My five bridesmaids voted and options two won. So I picked out a blue strapless dress with a mini slit. I really like it and I knew Mia would have an issue with it. I sent a picture to all the bridesmaid and confirming the right size before I ordered it.This is where it blew up. Mia was pissed I picked a revealing dress.  This resulted in an argument where she thinks I am a huge jerk and I told her she can step down if she has issues with the dress.She tried to get the family on her side but everyone knows I gave them options and had watched me struggle to find something everyone wants.Edit: she voted for the option where I pay for the dress. I truly didn’t ask her since her and MIL announced she was one of my bridesmaid at a family gathering. The only way to keep peace with the whole family was basically giving her what she wanted.I also have gone to 4 different shops to find a dress for everyone.",

We mentioned our plans to our family when my brother (23M) suddenly chimed in saying that Hawaii is a great idea and that him and his boyfriend will join too. I was taken aback when he said that and I told him that this isn't a random trip and it's supposed to be our honeymoon, but he said that we could do a double couples honeymoon together so him and his boyfriend can feel the experience of one as well.I told him that if he wants to feel the experience of a honeymoon they can just go to a separate trip instead of hijacking ours, but my brother went off at me saying that I'm selfish for not sharing this experience with him when I know that our country doesn't allow gay marriages and so he's never gonna feel the experience of a real honeymoon and this will be as close as he gets and somehow my parents are now backing him up as well (well, mostly my mom, but my dad usually goes along with her in order to avoid family conflict).

They wanted our names to have a theme without being matchy with the same initial so we got our names. The story was told to us when we were little and my parents were proud of the names they gave us.Back when we were all stuck at home my parents started to express regret about their choices for us. They actually told us over dinner one night that they wish they had given us better names and apologized for making us live with the names we were given. A few months after that apology my mom and dad told us they wanted us to be Elizabeth (sister), James (me) and Michael (brother). They said since we were kids and weren't in college yet and nobody had their license at that point it would be the best time to do it. All three of us said we didn't want to change our first names. My dad looked into whether they could do it when we said no and all answers he got pointed to a very strong no. But it was also unusual to change your older kids first name so they went ahead and tried anyway but once we were asked if we wanted different names they were told no.My parents brought it up a lot to us afterward. My brother asked why they wanted to name him Michael and said the name was crappy. They told him Michael was a timeless name that would age well and gave him some nickname choices. He said he hated it. So they asked if he would consider Charles instead which he said was an even bigger no. Our parents focused really hard on him for a while because he had asked the question about the name so they figured he was the most open.So far none of us have agreed to the name change. I told my parents that I know they regret the names but we're all used to and like our names and don't want to go for more boring and common names. My parents argued that in the future we will regret it and we'd have to pay for it ourselves when we're adults and we realize having weird names does not age well. I asked why they can't let us get there if we ever do. They said we should be thinking more of our futures and they accused me of having a really bad attitude because I said James was as bad to me as Cove is to them now. They told me to look online and I did and I saw a lot of hate for our names. But I told them it still didn't change my mind.My parents said we should respect them enough as parents to allow this and that we're all being disrespectful. AITA?",

She also says that once she is working then I can cut back on my hours I'm a welder, and relax a little. I have been working since I was 15, so literally half my life.

We have a good life. We want a few more years alone before we start our family.Over Christmas the in-laws just wouldn't drop it. I finally snapped. I said that if they wanted grandchildren then they could reimburse us for her education. They could further pay her the salary she would be giving up. When she returned to work they could pay her the difference between what she could be earning and her entry level position. They could pay for a nanny so my wife could work.Or they could back off and wait for us to be ready.They said that they couldn't afford all that. I asked them how they expected us to afford it.

Yesterday, I was preparing a bottle for our daughter when he said “ why don’t you move out the way, you don’t see you’re big’. He tried to play it off after and said he was just talking about my butt. It really hurt my feelings so I said “ at least a fat person can lose weight but your hair is never gonna grow back”. For context, he’s 27 but the front of his hair and the middle have thinned out a lot. He’s very self conscious about it to the point that he won’t leave the house without a hat and he’ll turn back around if he realizes that he forgot to take it with him.He’s been angry at me since I made the comment but I felt like if he keeps talking about my weight, then I can talk about his hairline. So AITA?Edit: I see a lot of people in the comments asking if I gained the weight after the pregnancy. It was during the pregnancy. People are also saying I can control my weight and I should be going to the gym. I do workout when I have the time. Finding time to go to the gym is very different for a father than it is for a mother. Yes I know two wrongs don’t make a right and when I calmed down, I realized I should’ve handled it in a better way. Thanks for all the feedback",

Noah was diagnosed with cancer last year and my mom and her husband were told there's some kind of different treatment he could get in another country and if they could raise the money, it would be better for Noah than the treatments available in the US. My mom and Alan could not afford it so they have been sending him to treatment here and saving for Noah's treatment. They made a lot of cut backs and asked that Emma and I give over any money we get so they can afford this. They have about 70% or something now and that has come from cutting out a lot. We eat very basic meals, they cancelled our internet and we didn't do anything for our birthdays or Christmas since the saving started. Any money that comes into the house goes on essentials or the treatment fund.My dad died 9 years ago and my paternal family stayed part of my life. They know what has been going on and they have been buying me little treats and taking me out to eat when they can. They also give me money every couple of weeks so I can have something if I ever need anything. I have been hiding that money because I know I would be told to give it up. I carry it everywhere because Emma is the type to snoop and then tell her dad. She has asked me before why I don't babysit to help make more money for her brother. She would work if she could but she's only 11.I spent some of the money from my grandparents over the weekend. I got my hair cut and I bought my best friend a gift for her birthday. I also got some food and spent some time at my dad's grave. My mom noticed my haircut and asked where the money came from and she realized I was lying when I said I had been with my grandparents and they took me because I forgot they were out of town. So I told her they gave me some money to get some stuff done. She told me a haircut was not a need and how selfish could I be. Alan heard her scolding me and he jumped in and asked what the hell was wrong with me. He told me this family has to pull together for Noah and I am acting like I don't care whether Noah gets this treatment or not. Of course by the end of the day Emma heard and freaked out. But then my mom ran into my best friends mom a couple of days ago, and she told mom my gift to my best friend was so sweet and thoughtful.I was sat down and yelled at for spending the money on not just me but on others. Alan asked me how I could give the money for a gift that means nothing when it could have gone to save \"my brother's\" life. I yelled back that it's not my job to pay for Noah's treatments and I'm already sacrificing but I refuse to go all out the way they want me to. I told them the money came from my family, family who was nothing to them and they need to let it go. Alan called me a selfish little bitch and he told me I should be ashamed of my repulsive behavior. Now Emma keeps telling me I'm a bad person.AITA?",

	"body" : "I (27F) am in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some advice.I've been seeing this guy for a couple months, and we decided to go to a nice high-end restaurant for a date. Initially I was going to wear a nice dark blue dress that I like to wear out, but he asked me to wear a different white dress that I had shown him once as it matched his outfit (I’ve never had a guy ask me this). The white dress in question was a gift from my late grandmother and was quite expensive, so I was reluctant but agreed and just asked that we didn’t go anywhere after where I might spill something on it or otherwise mess it up (he mentioned clubbing after dinner which is why I said that, I didn’t want to risk messing the dress up) and he said we could just go to dinner and  I could change out of it before doing anything else. Great!However, the evening took a turn for the worse when he accidentally spilled his red wine all over my dress. He had gotten an unexpected call and when he tried to quickly mute his ringer, his elbow hit his glass and it spilled all in the lap area of my dress before I could react. It was completely drenched and stained. He was apologetic at the time, and I tried to be cool about it, but inside, I was devastated, especially since I had mentioned specifically how I wanted to be careful wearing it.Later, I mentioned to him that the dress was very expensive and asked if he'd be willing to help with the cost of cleaning or replacing it. To get it professionally cleaned and the stain removed would cost $100, which I asked him to pay half of. To my surprise, he got quite defensive. He argued that it was an accident and that I was being unreasonable for expecting him to pay for something like that, and that it was my fault for wearing it out knowing that it could’ve happened.I feel like it's a matter of principle. Yes, it was an accident, but the dress is ruined, and it was extremely sentimental to me not to mention a valuable dress. He thinks I'm being materialistic and making a big deal out of nothing.

Me and Diana did not get along. Diana was spoiled and to adult me, it was obvious she resented not being the only child anymore. She took it out on me. She would brake my toys and steal my stuff and lie to get me in trouble. I would complain to dad and Tina but they told me to get over it. If I did the same, I would get punished. It only got worse as we got older. I felt abandoned by my dad. I often felt lonely in my house. So I guess you guys can see who the golden child was.At 16 Diana spread a nasty rumor about me in school and I almost got expelled. Diana got caught lying and got suspended. Of course dad and Tina blamed me for this. That was the last straw for me. I rang my cousin, Shyla from my mama side and told her what's been happening. She came over to my house angry at Tina and dad. She gave them a piece of her mind. Dad said if it bothered her so much, then she was welcome to have me. That was a blow to my heart to hear my own dad say that to me. So me and Shyla went to pack my stuff. Diana room was open and she was sitting on her bed smirking at me. We got my stuff and we left.

She said he was wanting to talk to me. Shyla handed me his number and said it's up to me. I did ring him out of curiosity, more than anything. He didn't even recognize my voice. But when I told him it was me, he broke down crying and most of the time I couldn't make sense of what he was saying.

She doesn't deserve this. This is enraged me and I just let out all my anger, hurt and frustration I had felt towards them and ended with I don't care if she had died!

She also takes forever to get the item back, she once lent my stuff  to a coworker and refused to ask for it back for a month. And I’ll never forget the day my usually quiet, reserved son snapped at her for trying to give away his Nintendo switch. If I wasn’t also fed up with her behavior I would have washed his mouth out with soap. I’ve had countless talks with her but she continues to do this. My son and I have resorted to locking up anything we didn’t want touched which is something we shouldn’t have to do in our own home.Last week I won a $300 tent in a raffle. I had no plans on using it so I was selling it. When I found a buyer and went to look for it I couldn’t find it. When I asked my wife she said she gave it to a friend of ours. I got mad at her and said she had no right to give it away. Her defense was since I didn’t spend money on it and was i planning on using it, it made sense to give it away for free. I told her that wasn’t her decision to make but she just kept repeating herself.I had enough of this and said she’s either going to pay me herself or get the money from who she gave it to, and if she didn’t I’d get law enforcement involved. Since she rather die than ask a friend for money she paid me out of her own pocket.This issue eventually got around to her family. While they did say she should have talked to me first they also reprimanded me for asking for payment. They reasoned that since I didn’t actually buy the tent I didn’t loose any money and it went to a friend who could actually put it to good use. I got several text saying I should be ashamed for extorting my wife for money.

My parents were able to make sure all my younger siblings had at least one activity outside of school to do but they never did that for me. I was forced to play football when I was 5 but by the time I was 7 my parents had started fostering and I was no longer doing that. My siblings all get to do something they like. Cora does dance for example. Some of my other siblings are in music classes.The younger kids were also prioritized with school field trips. So they always got to go while I haven't since I was 6. The last time I asked was when I was about 9 and my parents told me to work for the money to pay. My grandparents found out what they said and gave me the money and my parents took it off me to use for the household. My grandparents were so mad at  them for that.They delayed my tonsil surgery by 2 years because they prioritized 2 foster kids and two of my siblings surgeries over mine.My grandparents saw how much I was getting the short end of everything with my parents and they set up a college fund for me. It's a lot of money and really caught me off guard. My parents know about it but cannot access it. They only know because of a fight with my grandparents over the lack of saving for my future when they have saved something for my siblings. My parents said the money my grandparents saved should be divided equally because $350,000 is a lot to save for one grandchild when you have multiple.That money is still there and I have plans for it. But my youngest sister is 5 and she needs a pretty major stomach surgery. She's had a lot of health troubles since her birth and my parents have paid a lot of money on her medical expenses. They were told this surgery could turn her life around and give her a chance at living with less pain and stomach complications. It could give her a more normal childhood because she can't do a lot. They don't have the money for the surgery and they want me to give them the money to pay for it and for the expenses afterward. They said they need $270,000 for the whole thing and maybe they can give some of it back but they might need even more if stuff gets more complicated. I told them they can't have that money and they lost it and told me I was being selfish and I argued back that they take from me all the time. I asked why they didn't take the money they saved for all my siblings and use that, why does it have to be mine.

Everyone was so excited and happy when we found out she was having a girl.During this year's family Christmas dinner, she announced that she was going to name her kid Madelyn, but spelt differently of course! (as if that made it any better) Her daughter's name was going to be Madilyn. I was completely shocked. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect that Jasmin would want to name her kid Madelyn as well. If she told me before we named our daughter, I probably would've taken that into consideration before naming her.I asked Jasmin why she would want to name her daughter the same name as mine, and she said that technically it wasn't the same name since it was going to be spelt different. She also said that her great aunt's name was also Madilyn and that she thought that Madilyn was a cute name. Jasmin also mentioned that Madilyn was supposed to be the name of her kid before she had a miscarriage (this was before Madelyn was born). I never even knew that was what she wanted to name her kid because she never told anyone!I was really upset and told her she could've just told me before I named my daughter that she also wanted to name her daughter Madelyn. She said that I was always such a witch and that I probably would've named my daughter Madelyn either way. I don't even know what I ever did to this woman. I then asked what we were going to do about the confusion of them having the same name and she told me we could use my daughter's middle name! Like, what? I told her if anything, we should be calling her daughter by her middle name since my daughter came first.We went back and forth a few more times before I decided to leave early with my husband and Madelyn. My daughter was also pretty confused and asked why her aunt would want to name her daughter the same name as her. I'm still really upset and hopes she changes her mind, but this morning my BIL texted me and said that I should try to better understand Jasmin and her feelings. I texted him back and told him that she should stop being such a witch and try to understand my feelings instead. I really don't think I'm an asshole, but AITA?",

	"body" : "So I (22F) was at Goodwill the other day looking around. On one of the shelves I noticed a basket turned upside down, picked it up to look at it (I was looking for a container to put my jewelry in) and found this really pretty little marble statue underneath. Like one of those ones of a lady with the arms and head cut off. I really liked it and it was only 5 bucks, so I decided to get it. But this lady near me noticed what I was holding and said \"Uh oh. This other lady was looking at that. I think she hid it under the basket so no one else would see it\". I asked if she was gonna buy it, the lady said she wasn't sure. She looked around and said she didn't see the woman anywhere. I felt a little bad, but I carried it around for a while looking at other stuff, and figured if that lady saw me holding it she could come argue with me if she felt like it.After maybe 10-15 more minutes of looking, I was ready to leave and went to the checkout. Right when I set my stuff down I heard this voice say \"ARE YOU KIDDING ME?\" And this older lady came up right next to me and put her hand on the statue. I noticed a man was with her, probably her husband. \"I was gonna buy this, I hid it. It's mine\" she said. I don't like confrontation, but I was also kinda mad that she was already getting in my face. I said \"I've been carrying this around and you haven't come up to talk to me about it until now. I didn't know you were set on buying it\"\"Well didn't you notice it was hidden? I was making up my mind and I hid it so no one else would see it. And I decided, I'm gonna buy it\"\"Someone told me a lady was looking at it, but I didn't know you were gonna buy it. I'm sorry, I'm already getting it\" And we both looked at the poor cashier, who kind of shrugged and said \"yeah I mean she's already up here buying it. And you can't really call dibs on something, you haven't purchased it yet\". Then the lady's husband gets involved and says \"cmon kid, let her have the statue. We're gonna put it on the dining room table. Where are you gonna put it, your desk?\" And I said YEP I am because I'm buying it.They both just kind of scoffed and looked at each other like I was some young punk who had just disrespected them or something. I give the cashier my card, I sign for it, he hands me my bag, meanwhile they're still standing there. I don't think either wanted to do something as blatant as physically take it from me. The lady said \"You want it that bad, even though I already was gonna buy it? I've been looking for a decoration like this for months. Are you gonna die if you don't have it? And I said \"yes I am\" and I walked out cause I didn't feel like fighting anymore. Meanwhile they followed me outside (and lucky me we parked near each other) saying stuff like \"no respect!\" and \"unbelievable!\"And I swear to God I think the woman even said \"what a little bitch\" before she closed her door",

	"body" : "I [17F] just recently found out that my sister [21] is pregnant, and after she told me, she said that she wants us to swap rooms because my room would be more convenient for her to have. The main reasons she wants to swap are because my room is downstairs and hers is upstairs, and she doesn’t want to have to to carry a baby up and down the stairs constantly and she wants to easily be able to take the pram into her room. My room is also closer to the kitchen, has more storage space, and has an en suite.Her room is literally bigger than mine so I don’t know why she would want a smaller room even though she’s going to have more things to put in it, and although she doesn’t have an en suite, there’s a bathroom right beside her room so it’s not like she has to walk a mile for a bathroom or anything.But the main reason I don’t want to swap is because my room has just been freshly painted and had new flooring put in so I don’t want to just change rooms and have it basically been done for nothing, and I told her that and she said it was selfish of me to not want to give her my room, which is hypocritical because I asked if I could swap rooms with her  ages ago and she said no but now that she wants mine, it’s selfish of me not to give it to her. She started going on about how I have no idea how hard it’s going to be for her and a bunch of other stuff to try and make me feel bad, but I basically told her I don’t care how much she asks for it I’m not swapping.Edit: because people were asking, yes she pays rent.

	"body" : "So yesterday, me (28F), Jess (27F) and 3 other friends (mid to late 20sF) went to a Chinese restaurant. I’m Chinese, Jess is half Japanese/Chinese and the rest of my friendship group are Asian, if that’s relevant.For context, Jess unfortunately was victim to a verbal racist attack when covid first started. It was such an awful thing to happen and I’m still mad it happened. The incident traumatised her quite badly and she went to therapy for a couple of years.We are getting seated and there is a Caucasian man with his son (maybe 6-8 years old). They smile at me and I smile back. Anyway, our food comes and the kid is curious and I can hear him asking his dad “what are those ladies eating?”.The dad happily explains to his son the different kinds of seafood (like pipis), and pork belly and noodle dishes we were eating. It was really clear that they weren’t making fun of the food or us, and honestly I thought it was cute that the kid was interested. But Jess started getting agitated. I asked her what was up and she said she didn’t like that they were talking about us. Me and my friend tried to just say they were just talking about the food we were eating. Unexpectedly (as Jess is quite shy), she stood up and said to the dad, “this isn’t a zoo, you know?”. Then she walked out and some of us followed her out and me and another friend apologised to the man and kid who were really shocked.Outside m, we were trying to console Jess. She was adamant that the man was teaching his kid to be racist but we were all trying to tell her it wasn’t like that, and she said we were invalidating her. This went back and forth with us trying to say that the man and kid weren’t being racist. Finally, in my effort to try help, I suggested maybe Jess should go back to therapy.Jess gave me a really dirty look, called me a shit friend and left. A couple of my friends, although acknowledging that the way Jess reacted to the man and kid was abnormal, told me it wasn’t my place to suggest that, but my other friend said that I wasn’t wrong and as her friend who cares about her well-being, I had a right to suggest that.Jess and I have been friends since high school and I spent a great deal of time supporting her after the racist incident.AITA?——————UPDATE AND EDIT: Thanks everyone for your replies. For those asking what happened, essentially a group of men approached and surrounded her at a train station, shouting racists comments at her. If someone hadn’t intervened, she would have very likely been bashed or SAed.For those saying I should drop her as a friend, we’ve had a friendship that’s lasted nearly 15 years. I’m not going to give up on her because of an incident like this - and she honestly has never done anything like this before. She needs support and when the incident occurred I didn’t know how to appropriately handle it.Thank you everyone for your advice about it being wrong timing. Upon reflection and talking with my friends, we realised that none of us saw the signs early enough during that dinner that she was in crisis. We should have seen it when she started getting agitated inside the restaurant and perhaps taken her outside for a moment instead of dismissing her. None of us are really equipped to deal with someone in mental crisis and we are considering going to mental health first aid.Finally, I tried to call and then message Jess and apologise but she did not reply. However, her mum did call me today (I did not message her mum) and told me that Jess felt really bad about what happened and wanted to apologise to me and my friends. Jess also said she didn’t mean what she said about me being a bad friend and she was having a panic attack at the time. Jess isn’t feeling ready to talk to us yet and would rather her family support her for now until she’s feeling better. In the meantime, we will be sending chocolates and self care items.",

	"title" : "AITA for telling my dad the real reason my half sister won’t be in the same room with me?",
	"body" : "I (31f) have a half sister, “Ellen” (34f). Same dad, different moms, no I’m not the result of an affair.Ellen and I are not close, and never have been, we only saw each other at family get togethers. Ellen has a husband “Tom” (34). Tom is a nice guy, and when she introduced him to the family, he and my husband hit it off, and my husband ended up hiring Tom to work for him.Tom and Ellen’s got married and had a baby, and during this time they started having problems. I didn’t hear this from Ellen, but from my dad, and from my husband, who was told by Tom. Tom then started staying really late at work and then progressed to coming over to our house often for drinks with my husband, and by extension, me. He became a regular visitor to our house, and began unloading his problems.This went on for about 8 months until one evening Tom was quite tipsy and admitted he’d developed “a crush” on me. Understandably, this meant he didn’t come back to our house (he has profusely apologised for this and we’re fine now, but obviously I just prefer some distance).I guess that whole thing was a wake up call for him because he and Ellen started going to counselling. During the counselling, he told her about what had happened, because Ellen called me and screamed at me for the whole situation. She said she and Tom would never be in the same room with me again after “what I’d done”. She made excuses for not coming to family gatherings I was at for a while before my dad confronted her and she said she and I had fallen out and weren’t speaking. I went along with this because I didn’t want to tell my dad the truth either. It has been over a year of this.But this all came to a head over my dad inviting both of us and our families to NYE and getting mad that Ellen wouldn’t come if I was going. He started ranting at me that we needed to grow up and make peace and if we didn’t want to talk to each other fine but not being able to be in the same room was nuts. I got sick of being berated and said I agree but it wasn’t me who started it. My dad then demanded to know what the fight was about and wouldn’t let up. Eventually I just told him.He’s furious. He called Ellen and yelled at her, he called my husband and yelled at him. He is seething that no one told him and that he has been acting like things are fine with Tom this whole time. Ellen is furious with me for telling Dad, saying I did this on purpose and have ruined things with Tom after she’d worked so hard to fix them.I feel bad for the results, but I also feel like carrying the burden of this rift that I didn’t cause was unfair on me in the first place.

The day before we were scheduled to leave, I had a sit down with my elderly father to discuss his plans for his estate after passing. This estate (built my him and my mother before she passed four years ago) consists of 8 figures worth of commercial and residential property. He said he would give me and my sisters some cash (1% of what the properties are worth) and give everything else to my brother since it’s “tradition” (we are from a middle eastern background. My brother did work in the family business since college and has also benefited greatly from it (living in multimillion dollar home etc). The biggest part of the portfolio (a strip mall) was because the previous owner was a friend of mine who was selling it and decided to sell to my family because of our friendship.My sisters and I who are older than our brother worked alongside our parents during the building of their businesses and during lean times. We did the grunt work as preteens and teens. Additionally we did a lot of the caregiving for our mother when she was suffering from a terminal illness that robbed her of all of her body’s ability.I am shocked and dismayed to say the very least.

I understand that no one is owed an inheritance but this is beyond the pale.

I did address this in the comments but I understand that not everyone will see that.My boyfriend’s mom is bed bound and needs assistance into her wheelchair to get around. She can’t wheel the chair herself as she has arthritis (amongst other things) , so wheeling her chair would be much too heavy and strenuous for her.She needs assistance onto the toilet, into the bath, reaching into kitchen cupboards etc. Everything in her house has been adapted to be as accessible as it possibly can be, but she still needs a lot of assistance for her daily activities.I do a lot of these tasks for her during the night, as she sleeps a lot in the day so at night she’s pretty awake and is wanting food/water/bathroom visits. It was very clumsy of me to state in the comments that i “literally just go there to sleep and make sure she’s okay”, as that’s not the case, I just djdnt think before typing.

Each of our kids have their own kids as well. We have a daughter with one kid, a son with two and another son with two biological kids and a stepdaughter.Our youngest son was married, about ten or so years ago he cheated on his wife and they got divorced. He cheated with his current wife, then he adopted her daughter.We want to divide our state between our children and our grandchildren. We had a family gathering to talk about some of these things, especially the house in case any of our children wanted to buy it themselves.Our son got very angry when he heard that we're cutting off his adopted child from the will. We told him she's not our family and we don't support his life choices and how he ruined his family. He told us to stop holding a grudge for something that happened years ago and accept the child, or cut him and his family off. My wife and I think that his new wife and the child are living proof of him ruining his family. Do you think we are wrong in this? She is a child and he's right that she's \"his\", but does that automatically makes her our family? He said we're treating his wife and daughter poorly and we're acting like assholes towards a kid.The step daughter and the adopted daughter are the same girl. My son married her mother and then adopted her.Questions:The girl was 1 or 2 years old when my son and his mother started their relationship.We don't see or talk to each other often, only in family gatherings. They live in another state. She doesn't call us her grandparents.What each of our kids is getting are family heirlooms and not money. All the money will be distributed between our grandkids in our will to hopefully help them get their education paid.My son doesn't have contact with his ex wife or his biological kids, he cut them off and didn't even want to pay child support. My wife and I helped our daughter in law and our grandchildren.To make it clear. What my son is getting from us is some photos and items from his childhood that we keep. It's essentially \"trash\" but we like to look at them every once in a while to remember our kid's childhoods. He isn't getting money or jewelleryI'm getting a lot of comments, sorry if I can't answer all the questions.For those who wonder if the girl could actually be biologically my son's daughter, i don't know and it doesn't make a difference to me or my wife.For those who say that love should be unconditional, I disagree. Love is always conditional to the bare minimum to maintain a bond, that's my opinion.Yes, my son's two biological kids (the kids he had with his first wife) are in the will along with our two other kids' children.Our grandchildren are getting some heirlooms too, the things we're giving to our son aren't things that our other two kids would want.For those who are saying that I would neglect a child adopted by my children under different circumstances, no. This is all about the circumstances in which this girl and my son's new wife came into the family. I don't care if she's adopted or biological, it'll be the same for me. The circumstances in which my son cheated (which is bad enough) and proceeded to kick his family out and abandon them are the reason why neither my wife, me or the rest of our family has a good relationship with the three of them.My two other kids agree with us and aren't close to their brother either.",

	"body" : "I lost my daughter Abby 7 years ago. She was married to Scott and had three children with him who are now 11, 12 and 14. Scott and my grandkids stayed part of the family and last year Scott remarried. His current wife is Beth. We all knew Beth for a few years prior to the wedding and she was always very friendly. Though at times she could be a little pushy. Scott would always handle that though. After they got married Beth's pushiness got worse and Scott appears to have lost control.Beth was upset when she dropped my grandkids off one day that we had not added photos of her to our house and commented as such. In our living room we have a display with photos of our kids and their weddings. She felt her and Scott's wedding should be there.She was upset when my grandkids spent Mother's Day with us and our extended family and we did not include her. Scott wasn't invited either. Mother's Day is a difficult day for him due to a bad relationship with his own mother. But Beth said we should invite her too because she's part of the family and then she said she's one of our kids too. I asked her what she meant and she told me she is obviously going to be one of our kids now that she's the mother figure for our grandkids. I told Scott what she said and he was embarrassed and told me he would speak to her.Beth was also upset when my husband posted on Facebook to say something about our kids and she didn't get mentioned as one of our kids, but as Scott's wife (we mentioned Scott and how wonderful he was to Abby and how wonderful he is as a father).For my grandson's 14th birthday, we were all together and he wanted a \"mom's side\" photo. Beth attempted to get into the photo and when Scott tried to remind her she said she's part of the family now. He pulled her aside and the photo was taken without her. But she told one of my sons after that she felt like we weren't treating her as a daughter and then said Scott never treated her as a lesser wife.We saw them a little over Christmas and Beth was upset that we got them a joint gift (for her and Scott) instead of getting her one alone. She told me she's tired of feeling like she's not really family and she said she feels like we always put Abby first when she's here now. I saw red after this and I told her she can never take my daughter's place and the fact she ever thought she could is outrageous. She told me the kids call her mom and they think the world of her so why wouldn't we. I told her the kids have always called her Beth when I hear them and she turned around and said that's our fault because the kids should be calling her mom and they don't. She lost it from there. Beth stormed out and I explained what happened to Scott. He apologized and left the kids with us so he could speak to her.I think they worked it out but Beth said I was needlessly cruel to imply she's not as good as Abby and doesn't deserve to be our daughter.

	"body" : "UPDATE! :Well, I certainly wasn't expecting this post to get this many responses, so I first wanted to start off by thanking each and every one of you for taking the time to read my post and weigh in with your judgment  (even the people that sent me death threats in the DMs, you know who you are)Special thanks to those who sent in their judgments via DM when the mods locked down the thread.After reading the comments and having time to cool down and think about all this.. I accept that I was an asshole in this situation.While I was right to be mad, I overacted and made this situation something that it wasn't.This is also a wake-up call for me to stop being lazy and do a better job of securing my documents. I'll admit that the inconvenience of locking everything down led me to become sloppy. Not anymore, I've already ordered a lock for my office door and a fireproof safe for my paper files. My desk has lockable drawers, and my computer is password protected. I'm also seriously considering a security camera.Last night, I probably spent 20 minutes apologizing to both my niece and sister. I promised that I would never yell at her or use that type of language towards her ever again. She accepted my apology, we gave each other a hug, and she also apologized for being in the office. My sister forgave me as well.I also took them out to their favorite restaurant. My niece and I had a conversation over dinner about the importance of attorney client privilege and the secure handling of confidential information. 2 things that are extremely important if she's serious about becoming a lawyer. She seemed genuinely curious, and I answered all her questions that I could about the type of cases that I handel.When we got home, I decided to surprise her.  I showed her around the office, and I let her take another picture at my desk (after I put away all my sensitive files, of course).Thanks, reddit,Numerous CycleMy(28M) Sister(33F) is visiting me this week with her daughter/my niece (13F). I was excited to host them in my house as I haven't really seen my family much ever since I moved away from our home state for my career.For context, I'm a lawyer at a large firm. That means that I have to take work home often, which is why I have a room in my house set up as an office.My office has privileged information about cases and clients.Long story short, when my sister and niece arrived yesterday and after I helped them get settled in, I told them that there's only one rule that I have for staying in my house: My office is off limits.Fast forward a few hours and Everything's fine and dandy, I'm just sitting on the couch with my sister, watching a movie, until I get a call from a senior associate at work asking me to do a quick review of a document that he sent me via email.When I get upstairs, I see the door to my office is wide open, and the lights are on. When I go in to investigate, my niece is in there sitting in my chair and taking selfies with her feet on my desk.I was beyond furious,I only have one rule for guests at my house, and it's to stay out of my office. I have that rule for a reason. Not only would I be at risk of disbarment, but the integrity of the entire case would be jeopardized if any of that information is leaked.While I'm not accusing her of that specifically, I just don't want uninvolved people in my office taking pictures and posting them on social media where there may or may not be protected Information in view of the camera.I asked her what the hell she was doing, and she said, \"I was just curious, I want to be a lawyer like you when I grow up.\"I told her  \"get the fuck out and stay out you little bitch\".My sister came running up the stairs after my niece started crying and she told me that I was a \"monster\" for \"talking like that to a kid\"I told her that she had no business being in my office, and my sister said that it dosent matter because \"she's just a kid\".So,AITA?",

	"body" : "So, I know it might seem a bit stupid, but its important to me. It is currently a argument with my family. I(25, F) had my prom in 2017 and I bought my entire prom outfit for myself due to my family not having the best economy and I saved for over a year to be able to buy my dream dress and jewelry(everything in total about $300, which is a lot for us). I had an amazing time and that dress is very important to me since I have never had the best self confidence and it made me feel beautiful.Now my sister(18, F, lets call her Annie) is having her prom later this year and she asked if she could use my dress as well. She loves it and wished to use it. I told her that I would prefer if she didnt since it is so important to me(I also have a nero disorder and it makes it hard for me to let other people use my things) and she said okay and said she at least wanted to ask, but she was fine with finding another dress and I said Id help pay if she wanted (and if she wanted, she was welcome to use the jewellry, she will wear the hair accessories) I am pretty stable in income. Annie thanked me and said we could go shopping together.Now, I live about three hours away from my family due to school and I dont go home often due to not having a car. I came home last week to visit as my nephews(cousins kids, shes like a sister) are getting baptised. When I walk through the front door to my parents house, Annie is wearing my prom dress and my grandma and mom are taking messurments. I ask them what they are doing and they said that I'm being am AH for not letting Annie use it. She is my \"baby sister\" after all(moms words). I got upset and screamed at Annie to take it off, which I later apologised for, she believed I changed my mind since mom said I had agreed. I yelled at my mom and grandma because they tried to go behind my back and even change the dress to better fit Annie, she is 155lbs, I was almost 300lbs when I wore it. I cried and yelled at them. As soon as Annie came back with my dress, I took it and packed it down, saying I'd stay with my cousin.Now my family is torn. Some people agreeing with me and some saying Im an AH for not letting Annie use it. I dont feel like I was in the wrong for not letting her use it, after all it was all my dress that I payed for and I even offered to pay for her dress.So AITA?EDIT: Since a lot of people have mentioned not wearing it again. I have worn it since. It's not the typical \"prom dress\", its more a flowy summer dressAlso, the reason I didn't bring it with me is because I live in a dorm room and I could only bring the essentials with me. Once I move to a bigger place, I planned on bringing all my stuff to my new place. The dress is currently at my cousins place and I might bring it back with me when I go home.Please don't blame my sister for this. Her and I have talked it out and we're on good terms. We will buy a dress together once her prom gets closer(May)",

	"body" : "Every year, my family does Christmas at my mom's, and she insists that we open all presents together (even gifts between spouses, etc.). It's normally an ok tradition, but sometimes it can spark jealousy or comparisons between families.This year, my husband saved up and bought me my dream designer handbag for Christmas. I know some people aren't into that, but it's something that I truly love. We're not well-off, but we're not doing poorly either, but I knew that the handbag would cause a lot of discussion amongst my siblings and parents. I just didn't want their opinions and criticisms to ruin a special gift my husband worked hard to get for me.So this year, my husband got me an extra gift that wasn't the \"real\" gift (it was a moderately priced skincare set). Christmas came and went without drama, but I recently posted a picture of my husband and our kids at dinner, and my handbag could be seen hanging off the back of my chair. One of my friends commented underneath about how gorgeous my Christmas gift was as well.Long story short, word got back to my family and they totally blew up. Some were annoyed that I opened a private gift separately from the family. Others were criticizing the price of the gift. My siblings are now calling me disingenuous for harboring a secret gift, and they said that I did it because I think I'm better than them.I didn't open it with them because I didn't want their opinions, but now I'm starting to feel like an AH for keeping it a secret. I knew either way they'd all criticize me though since it was so much more expensive than all other gifts, so I don't know whether or not I'm wrong.",

	"title" : "AITA for not letting our nanny leave for a date during our vacation?",
	"body" : "My wife and I had our first child last year and it's been quite an intense few months. My wife has been on an extended 'maternity leave' but on top of that we've also hired a nanny/maid to assist us with the baby as well as keep the house in order. She stays in our guest house. To celebrate our anniversary I planned for us to take a trip by ourselves just to reconnect and give her some proper time away from the our son. She was excited about leaving but was slightly concerned about leaving our son behind (her mother was going to come down and babysit with the nanny). Trying to ease things I asked the nanny if she'd be willing to come along with us on our trip and take care of the baby - stressing that this was supposed to be our couple vacation so most of the childcare will be hers and more than usual. She jumped at the idea and so I also arrange her ticket and accomodation (to be clear she was also paid extra for the 'overtime').The trip was a week long and our arrangement was going quite well at first. My wife was relaxed, we reconnected and our son was close by for whenever we missed him. We would take our son and give her a break either in the mornings or afternoons. On our last day she asked if we could take the night shift as she'd met someone who'd asked her on a date. Besides that going against our arrangement (the point was to give us a break from the sleepless nights), I'd already paid and planned an intimate date on the beach with my wife for our last night. It became a bit of an issue with her trying to guilt my wife and saying we were being unfair but by the end of it, we didn't give in and she looked after the kid. Upon returning my wife heard her on the phone saying that she was thinking of quiting over all of this and that we were blocking her future so here we are.Wife thinks we made a mistake, I don't disagree that it might've been assholish but ultimately it was our arrangement and she was paid extra for it. Are we the assholes?Edit: the post has been up for 12 hours at the time of writing this and this is the first time checking in since the first hour due to life but I just wanted to clarify some things I've seen come up.She got paid double her usual daily rate. Since she has consistent our daily we just refer to it as daily rate where she 'works' 8 hours. So we paid her for 16 hours of work daily.Our expectations were very clearly expressed to her and she agreed that it wouldn't be a problem. Depending on our plans, some times we took mornings and sometimes we took afternoons but on any given day it was one of the two. This was also preplanned since our trip had an itinerary. Each of these breaks averaged about 5 hours and that excludes the spontaneous breaks whenever we missed him and prepared him for bed.Also this assumption that my wife and I can't and don't take care of our child is silly. The nanny is there only to assist whenever my wife needs to nap/rest. My wife takes care of most of the childcare and I step in when I get back from work. Most of her [maids] work is housework. My wife is staying in home because of her traumatic birth which had complications she's still recovering from. She fully plans on returning to work when she's fit and our child is old enough.",

	"body" : "My mom was a single mom to me until I (28M) was 7. She then met my stepdad Joe and married him. Joe had been divorced for 3 years and had two kids 6F and 4M at the time. Joe's relationship with his ex-wife was hostile, possibly the most hostile I have ever witnessed even today. Joe's ex decided her and Joe's kids should never treat my mom with respect and she had them treating my mom like she was the other woman. I was upset for my mom at the time and she told me they would grow up and realize what their mom had done and they would come around, at least to the point of being civil.I think at some point my mom saw her stepkids as a challenge she needed to win. She went out of her way to win them over and there were many times it came at my expense. The worse they treated her the more she focused on them and forgot she had an actual son who loved and needed her. Joe was fine but he worked a lot so I felt abandoned by my mom and I felt like my mom wouldn't even notice if I was gone.When Joe's kids were teenagers their mom died and they moved in with us permanently. Before this they were at our house every other week. Them moving in was hell. They would yell insults at my mom on a daily basis, would tell her they wished she had died instead of their mom, they called a disgusting, repulsive whore who infected everyone she met. They spread a rumor around high school that mom had cheated on Joe and had infected him.Joe had his kids in therapy, he had talks with them, issued consequences for their mistreatment of my mom. But at no point did it stop and equally, at no point my mom gave up.When I moved out for college it became clear to me that mom was going to stay more concerned with her stepkids than with me. She was disinterested when I introduced her to my wife (we met in college). She really didn't take much of an interest in our wedding planning. She was busy trying to get Joe's kids to see her because once they moved out they told Joe they would only see him alone. Once or twice his kids asked my mom for money and that kept her holding on.When my wife and I had our first child is when I gave up. My mom showed zero interest and didn't make any effort to meet my daughter for weeks and when she did meet her there was still zero interest.Joe went to his kids for Christmas this year and left my mom home. Mom sent me a text saying this and I ignored it. Two days ago she left a voice message saying I should have invited her to my house for Christmas so she wasn't alone and could be with her son and grandchildren. I called her right back and told her she can't discard us and then expect me to invite her to Christmas. I told her she wanted to chase people who would rather see her dead and would dance on her grave than her son who loves her so she can fuck off and leave me alone and stop trying to make us her consolation prize.Mom claimed I was cruel and out of line with how I treated her.

I have a quiz each lab halfway through that is 20 minutes long, and these quizzes are 40% of our grade. He also does not do remakes, no exceptions. So I can't miss. It would be 5 points clean off my grade, and I need an A in the class. I take my grades really seriously because I want to go to medical school. I wouldn't miss that lab if my house was on fire, lol.Missing the rest of lab would suck, too. My friends said they'd record it, but unlike my lectures our lab is completely visual, so a recording is useless. But I decided I'd skip for her anyway and just bug my friends/TA to teach me the material I missed.I told her I'd be 30 minutes for me to take the quiz and then I'd skip the rest of lab. But she said wow, so your grades are more important than me and my health? I said it's not more important, but it is important. I said she could go to the bookie at our school and buy Advil. She was close by because I parked my car in the garage of that building, but she said she's in way too much pain to go.Plus, she said she's literally bleeding through her clothes and has no tampons. It would be embarrassing, and I'm wrong for making her wait.I said all the bathrooms on campus have free tampons. I told her to go grab one from any of the bathrooms, but she said again she can't move she's in too much pain.At this point, I'm not really sure what to do. But I'm already missing my classes and the rest of lab for her, which I never do, so she should see I'm trying to accommodate her.I told her it's not far at all, only like a couple minute walk to the elevator, but I'd buy her tampons/advil from the bookstore if she waited for me.She said holy fuck, I don't have a choice. I guess I'm waiting, but you are being such an asshole right now. You care about your grade more than you care about me.I was like oh my god, lol. I was frustrated and said you have your period at the same time each month. Why didn't you bring tampons/advil? This isn't a surprise. Which resulted in her getting upset I was making it her fault and she called me sexist and said I have no idea what it's like for her. I agreed I didn't, but said I'd be there in 20 minutes.I took the quiz and ended up meeting her at my car 20 minutes later with Advil, tampons, and water. But she is not happy.

My parents always said he was their first kid, they loved him like a son, etc.I always felt a bit weird about this. David is a nice guy, but he’s not my brother. I never understood why it was my parents’ job to pick up the slack of my grandparents’. It caused a few disagreements in my youth that always boiled down to “David has nothing, you have everything, be nice”. I hated that i essentially went from an only child to a younger sister without being asked. I never looked at David as a brother but obviously due to our small age gap, I never saw him as an uncle. To me, he’s just family. We get along well.David is now married with a daughter, Aria. My parents are “grandma and grandpa” to her.

As Aria is too little to speak (8 months), I planned to let it go for now.Yesterday, we were at my parents’ for Christmas. Aria was being fussed over, as usual. When it came time for David and his wife to help her unwrap the gift my husband and I got her, David told Aria “this is from Auntie Tabitha and Uncle Mike!” Without thinking I said “ just Tabitha and Mike”. David gave me an odd look but went back to unwrapping.Later on, privately, David asked if I was okay. I said yes, why? He said I got weird during gifts. I said not weird, just factual. I’m not Aria’s aunt. He was still confused. I said I’m not his sister. This seemed to hurt his feelings but he said okay, apologized and said he’d never say it again.My mom pulled me aside later and said I was cruel to David. She said he considered me his sister. I simply said I’m not, and I’m not that baby’s aunt. My mom gave me a disgusted look. She and my dad barely spoke to me the rest of the night, though David and his wife were polite.My husband feels there were better ways of going about it. AITA?",

My parents have been hinting they want to come visit and stay for 3-4 months the only issue is they are extremely against any smoking especially marijuana. I explained to my parents who are extremely old school that sure they can visit but my husband does smoke after work for pain and to wind down he works 6days a week 16 hrs days. Immediately they said well when we are there he can’t smoke and that’s final. I find it unfair that my parents would even say this or expect something like that because well my husband’s parents have a different mindset they always say hey you pay the bills here we are just guest and don’t make a fuss about him smoking . My husband sacrifices so much and works so hard so and he doesn’t drink or anything else so one joint is so minor in my eyes. My parents then involved my siblings who were writing me and calling me disrespectful and I have no manners etc.  My dad literally used to down bottles of liquor after work and be extremely annoyingly loud and drunk and rude when we were growing up, but my mom would always defend it saying “he’s the man of this house who works hard leave him alone” so AITA for telling my parents just don’t visit our place and we will make the financial sacrifice to go visit them instead 2x a year  for a weekend (obviously not staying under their roof we will  get our own hotel car rental things of those sorts)",

	"body" : "So to start this off, this issue is with me 22f, my sister 26f and her husband 30m.To add some backstory, basically ever since they started growing, my breasts have been large, I have a very small frame otherwise and I am 5ft2, so almost my whole life I have thought that my body looked weird. I have always covered up as best as I could with large hoodies, big t-shirts and so on. I have always dressed this way as I genuinely was ashamed and hated my body. I started working at 16 knowing my main goal was to afford a breast reduction, last year I was finally able to afford it and got them done. They are still a bit on the bigger side, but I have never ever felt so comfortable and happy in my own body as I do now (not to mention the weight that has LITERALLY been lifted off my shoulders!?).So this last weekend my sister and her husband came to visit our family, and we had planned a dinner at a restaurant. It was nothing extravagant, but still a pretty nice place. I just wore jeans with a tight fitting shirt, it did not show my breast but since it is tight fitting you can see the outline of them. I thought everything went well, we all chatted and talked like usual, but a bit in I noticed BIL was staring at me extremely much. I got kind off uncomfortable and I think my sister also noticed and she was silent for almost the whole night after that. I thought she was mad at BIL and that she could see that I was uncomfortable with his stares.But the same night she texted me, telling me that I did not need to dress so inappropriate in front of a married man, that I need to have some self respect and that she did not think I was the type to try and seduce a married man. I texted her, explaining that it was not my intention and told her that I actually felt uncomfortable with his stares. She texted me back just saying that if I did not want him to stare, then I should have not dressed that way.I was extremely upset by all of this and talked with my mother, but my mother agreed with my sister. I am starting to feel like I should’ve thought about covering up and do more, especially since my mother also thinks I was an asshole for this..",

We’ve saved for this trip for years and were super excited.This place is about 3 hours away from my husband’s family. They invited us to spend some days with them. However, from the start I said I wanted alone time with just the 4 of us. With the kids getting older, we don’t get a lot of time with them. We don’t have the money to travel often. I suggested 3-4 days with his family, then we’d go to the actual vacation spot. I also set the boundary we’d stay in a hotel. They all seemed to agree.Then out of nowhere, my husband’s family decided to go to our vacation spot for the full 8 days. That’s when the hints began that we all get a house to rent. I said no. I love my husband’s family but it’d just be too much and I wanted time just us. We don’t need to be around each other 24/7. After that, my SIL started making plans for all 8 days that included us.I put my foot down to my husband and said no. We could spend 4 days with his family, maybe 5. But I wanted just a few just us. We never get to go on vacation. And his family visits once or twice a year so it’s not like we don’t see them.My husband says I’ve hurt his family’s feelings. When I spoke to my SIL she said I should understand why it hurts I won’t spend the entire time with them. I asked how they’d feel if they planned a trip and we tried to change the plan. She said family does this stuff for each other.Now, I’m already dreading the trip and wonder if I’m being over dramatic and should just give in to avoid drama. AITA?Edit: As it’s already been asked: we chose this spot because it’s somewhere our kids have always wanted to go. Of course we can’t give them everything they want in life, but now we can finally afford it. As I said, we never get to vacation and I wanted to give this to them.Edit 2: We can’t cancel/change dates as we put down non-refundable deposits.Edit 3: I understand that it is Reddit and people expect the craziest things to happen. I understand the concern that my husband would give them the address to the Air B&B and they’d just show up to intrude on our “off days”. However, knowing them, they aren’t the type to do this. They will respect the actual boundary but then you’ll hear about it for the next 5 years. I am positive that they won’t intrude on our “off days”.

Leah never got on with Niyah, didn’t want to spend time with her and was just generally unpleasant to her. We are currently in family therapy and honestly I think Leah just says the meanest thing possible to avoid actually discussing her feelings with us. She’s absolutely amazing to hang around with one on one but is unpleasant around Niyah.We were all supposed to spend Christmas together, as per our custody agreement. Leah is sixteen now and we have been more lenient but we have always adhered to our agreement for holidays and birthdays. On Christmas Eve Leah left to see her boyfriend’s family and drop off her gifts. At around six I call her and ask when she’s heading home, she says she’s staying. I know her mom lives near her boyfriend and asked if that’s where she was going. She didn’t answer. I told her to come home and she pretty much agreed but then never did. I did call her boyfriend’s parents and they confirmed she left to her mother’s and I called her mother who said Leah was there.Niyah was heartbroken because she felt like Leah didn’t want to be there because of her. This year Niyah handled all the gifts, she did the work of going in store and picking them up/picking them out. I decided my daughter wasn’t allowed to shit on Niyah’s efforts to at least be civil with her, so when Leah got home and I asked why she wasn’t at Christmas, she said she wanted to spend it with her real mom. I said that’s fine. When she asked about her gifts I said her “fake mom” got it for her, so she didn’t need them. Needless to say, she’s pissed at me and hasn’t said anything. Niyah appreciates me putting my foot down, but feels like Leah is a lost cause and to just give her the gifts. Leah’s mom agrees she needs to stop treating Niyah badly and expecting no consequences.

I needed cleaning so last week I called an agency and they send a girl over to clean the house and we agreed on 40USD an hour. (let's call her Eva). So Eva who is around 19/20 years arrives at my house with her little sister 8F. I asked her why her little sister was here and she said she had no one else to leave her with. I wasn't very pleased but assumed she didn't have a choice and didn't say anything. I showed Eva the play room of my daughter and said it was to be cleaned as well and her sister started staring around the room touching all the toys. I again didn't say anything. Eva started working and I went to my room to get ready to pick up a cake for Alaia and to pick Alaia from school.I heard a noise in Alaia's playroom so I rushed over and saw Eva's sister playing in the room and she broke a glass bowl that I had custom made for Alaia when she was born. At this point I was annoyed but again I held myself and told Eva to clean it and keep an eye on her sister. I went out picked up Alaia's favorite cake with strawberries. It was a cake that had strawberries on only one side on the top and on that same side there were more decorations etc. I put it in the fridge and left again to pick up Alaia. When we walked in the kitchen I saw Eva's sister eating a big piece of the cake and exactly the part with the strawberries and more decorations. I have never had an issue like this before in fact the cleaning ladies never open my fridge or anything cause they have no business there. I asked Eva what she thought she was doing and she told me \"My sister was sad and really wanted cake so I figured she could have a piece\".Alaia started crying because she had been looking forward to her cake with strawberries and now the piece with strawberries were gone. I told Eva that it is not her place to figure whether her sister could eat something from my fridge without asking me. She could have waited for me to get back because I told her I would be back. I told her that even if she did do this she should have not taken the whole decorated piece because she could've also figured that this cake was meant for my daughter. Eva said that \"You are getting mad for no reason just take the money from my pay\". I told her she could pack her stuff and leave with her sister and she didn't  have to finish the house cleaning. She had been at the house for only 2 hours but I payed her 120USD and told her to get out. So I told a friend and she told me that I overreacted over a piece of cake and I should have understood the little girl. I again said that it is not just cake but it is rude to open my fridge and take out a cake that is not unboxed yet and eat it.

We plan your wedding start to finish, or, B. You plan your wedding and we are there on the day of to execute the timeline, coordinate vendors, etc. etc. etc. to make sure the day runs smoothly and you have no stress.Here's what happened with one of our Package B clients:The ceremony begins at 6PM (in a different area on the same property) and the bride was told that not only would she be the only wedding in the room that she booked on that day, but that because she was the only wedding in that room that day she would also be able to go in there prior to her ceremony to take photos as all vendors had ample time to complete the room setup.Normally these photos would happen during cocktail hour, but she didn't want to miss out on that so we were trying to accommodate her and it should've been no issue considering she was told that she was the only wedding that day.Yesterday, we received an email from the florist stating that they couldn't gain access to the reception room, according to the venue, until 5:45PM as there is another wedding occurring in the same room and it ends at 5:45PM. Normally, this would be fine and we would simply rearrange timings and notify the vendors so that they can allocate additional personnel to account for a short setup time.So, we called the client and asked if she was aware of this (we understand now that she should've called the venue first to confirm this, however it ended up being accurate so it wouldn't have made a difference). She was not and was incredibly upset.She and her father called the venue and, apparently, went off on them. The venue event specialist then called my partner and scolded her for telling the client stating that \"telling her the week of her wedding was bad coordinating practice and that we should've just let it go and then hung up on her without letting her speak. After speaking with my partner about this phone call, I called the event specialist myself to get a feel for what was going on from his point of view. He gave me the same treatment, would not allow me to speak, and hung up on me.Immediately after we attempted to call the bride at 5:50PM, but she didn't answer.

An hour later, we sent another text to the group chat we have with her and her MOH (her sister) asking to please call us, but neither one of them has responded.

My parents think it's just because she didn't grow up with the rest of us but that it's fine, and it's not.Yes, by the time she came to live with us, she was almost 18, but it's not because of that. It's because she cost the rest of us our futures. See, when she came to live with us, she had been \"independently\" home schooled. She was said to be very smart, but testing revealed that she only had about a 9th grade education and no transferable credits. Neither our school or the public school were willing to place her above 9th grade. Since she was only about a month from turning 18, this would mean she would be in high school until her 21st birthday and would more likely than not have to drop out anyway. The only other option was to have her get a GED.They were devastated, especially because she had an offer from family friends to get her into and through college if she did a specific program that she DID have advanced education in. If she didn't graduate that year, they would question how bad it was and likely rescind the offer. The only other option was for her to get a GED, which would force the family friend to rescind the offer even if they still wanted to help because she could never get accepted with a GED.My parents worried over this, until someone they knew who was the admin of another private school offered to help out. They offered to enroll her as a senior and she could spend the year \"catching up\". Provided they saw it in their hearts to give a donation, of course. ~100k later, she \"graduated\" from an accredited high school and moved on to college.My family is just normal middle class, so paying that meant that the rest of us had to take out massive student loans, and my youngest siblings even had to switch to public school. My older brother got some help before this, but there wasn't a dime for the rest of us. My parents justify it by saying that they had to do it because it was their job to give all of their kids as close to an equal start to their lives as possible, and this was the only option to do that for her.My mom asked why we all have strained relationships with Liana, and it finally came out that truthfully, we resent her for the huge financial load on us and the entire family that she caused. It's been 10 years and she's never even tried to apologize or make amends, and it's grating.

I pay them in yuan and arrange the delivery over wechat so there is no tip and tax and they give me discounted prices.A week later she didn't have many groceries left and she asked me to add something for her and she will pay me back. I refused because she isn't part of the agreement and I don't want to betray the restaurant owners and also she wouldn't be able to pay me back in yuan.She seems upset and isn't being as cordial.aitaEdit: Ok the problem has been solved, i contacted two of the restaurants which are the ones i most frequently use and they told me it is fine to order for my roommate and she can order herself if she installs wechat. She doesnt want to use wechat so i have told her she can ask me.For those saying tax evasion etc, these restaurant owners are really kind people and often even give free meals at their restaurants to chinese international students who are struggling (sometimes others too not just chinese just that most customers are asian). I work now and am not a student anymore but they know that and said i can still use the services.This is a lot cheaper than uber eats and doordash but the only thing is you need to order only at lunch or dinner time.",

	"body" : "I'm not sure what crawled up my MILs ass but her and I got along so well before I got pregnant. She called me her daughter, came over to see me all the time, called me randomly to just talk, told me she loves me all the time, etc. But after I got pregnant, something switched in her. She stopped calling. She never said \"I love you\" back when I said it. She only came over to see my husband and 9 times out of 10, it was trying to get him out of the house to go with her. Barely gives me a hello/goodbye in passing. She even tried staying in the labor and delivery room after she was already told no because \"her baby needs support\", and clung to my husbands arm- several times trying to get him to go sit on the couch with her instead of standing by me where he was (she was kicked out by nurses).Since I had my daughter 3 months ago she has come over a good 10-15 times and has literally only held my kid twice. She just follows my husband around everywhere and still tries to get him to leave with her to go do chores/tasks for her (changing tires, changing oil, fixing her computer, moving around her house, etc etc etc). And honestly none of that bothers me nearly as much as her comments about how my daughter looks nothing like me and looks exactly like HER and my husband. For a bit of context, my husband looks nothing like his mom. He is a spitting image of his father. His mom is short, blonde, brown eyes. He is super tall, black hair, green eyes. You can't tell they are related at all. But she insists my daughter looks just like her and my husband and nothing like me. She's made these comments more times than I can count and I just give a \"yeah okay Becky\" and leave it.But yesterday I hosted a dinner for the family and obviously invited her. She shows up with a scrapbook album with a bunch of photos of her and my husband from birth to present. She was showing/telling everyone who would listen that my daughter was \"basically not even mine if you go off of looks\". My husband spoke up a few times with a clipped \"she actually looks just like my wife\" but his mom didn't acknowledge him. But then she got to my mom and my mom, being a \"no bullshit\" woman, said \"Are you blind or are you just being ignorant? That girl looks just like my daughter and nothing like you. Kinda weird to me that you are desperately pushing the narrative that the baby looks like your son AND you considering your son looks nothing like you either.\" No one in the house said anything but a few of them were chuckling. My husband also didn't say anything but he looked more like a deer in headlights than anything. My MIL then left. She group texted my husband and I later on saying she will never forgive us for not defending her against my mom \"making a scene and embarrassing her in front of everyone.\" I don't feel bad. My husband does. AITA?ETA: She has 4 kids. My husband is the youngest (he's 27). Her two daughters have 1 child each, both 12yo girls. Her other son has 5 kids. She takes her daughters kids once a month. She has never made a conscious effort with any of her other sons kids, outside of his oldest (9f). She doesn't act like this with her other kids at all. She acts uninterested all together. Ages: (not sure if it's relevant) MIL is 61. My mom is 44. My husband and I are both 27.",

Neither of us got our first choices but we love the name and it fits our son beautifully, we believe. I knew my son's name was a bit of a standout among my family. They like to reuse the same names that are popular and always seem to float pretty high in naming charts. For boys the top three in our family are James, Benjamin and William. But Reid isn't a weird or unheard of name.My family were all very quiet when we announced the name and almost immediately they started dropping comments about \"people making weird naming choices for their children\" which never directly mentioned my husband and me but we both felt it was aimed at us. Then they commented a few times how there's nothing wrong with good, solid, classic names that everyone knows and loves and reuses. But then they started to say Reid was an \"odd choice\" or that they had no idea where we found such a name, even though it's in the top 400 choices. My parents accused me of trying to be trendy and not thinking about my son's future.I decided to confront my family without my husband present because I felt like it wasn't fair to drag him into it more. I asked them what their problem was and why they were being so mean about the name. They told me they HATED Reid and they felt it was a very unattractive name and we did not think it through at all. They told me we should have reconsidered and given him a real name, not something trendy that came up in the last 20-30 years. They said we had so many beautiful names to choose from and we made a horrible decision. Then they said they had tried to gently show us the light but we ignored their efforts.I told them if their comments about my son's name were supposed to make me regret the choice then they failed, because all it did was make me regret them, because they were being rude and hurtful. My family did not take my comment well and told me I was being rude and I was behaving like a child who can't accept the truth.AITA?",

My son knew exactly what he was doing.Devin’s essay did bypass the plagiarism software but his teacher immediately recognized that it was from Cliffnotes and informed me that Devin would be receiving a zero, which is how I became aware of the situation.Devin’s grade dropped to a D. Devin asked me to essentially fight with the school to get his grade fixed. I told him no and that he deserved the zero. If you’re struggling with an essay, you reach out and ask for help. You don’t try to cheat your way out. He knew better than that.Devin’s mom “Emma” called me because she just received the physical report card in the mail and saw the D in English. Devin hadn’t told his mom about what happened and it’s too late to challenge the zero now since grades have already been finalized.Emma tried to interrogate me on why I didn’t challenge the zero when it was possible. I told Emma that I wanted this lesson to stick with Devin. Devin will graduate high school in two years. Getting a D in high school is better than getting kicked out of university or fired from a job for trying to pass off someone else’s work as his own.Emma argued that a D will seriously hurt Devin’s university prospects. She said she doesn’t condone what Devin did and would have been in agreement with a home punishment such as grounding Devin. But that I was a terrible parent for making our son experience a punishment that she says can seriously impact his future.Unless Devin were applying to an Ivy League (which he has not had any interest in) then I doubt one D will destroy his university prospects.

My parents marriage was over pretty much when he died. I'm almost positive she was with my sister's dad before my dad died and before the marriage was basically over. But their marriage was shitty so maybe it doesn't matter. Not sure dad would have even cared at the point when he died. They were not good together.My mom's husband/sister's dad is my stepdad. But really he's my mom's husband. I'm not close to him. I don't have much to say about him. I think he can be a jerk but he's good to my mom and good to my sister and brother (12M). He would have adopted me and been good to me but he's not someone I would have wanted to be adopted by, if I wanted to be adopted. It's a lot about him as a person and his views and stuff he says about people and somewhat about him not being so great about my dad after he and mom got married but I digress.My sister knows I don't really have much of a relationship with her dad. I do the bare minimum and if mom died tomorrow or they divorced tomorrow, I wouldn't remain in touch with him. He knows it. Mom knows it. My siblings at least pick up on it.I gave my son a name that honors not just my dad but my aunts and uncles and grandparents too. It's a name that connects to the family as a whole but gives him his own identity and is also a name we (my husband and myself) love.After my son was born my sister made some comments that I should have honored her dad in his name somehow. I told her that wasn't something we wanted to do but she could always do so in the future if she wanted. She did not let it drop. She mentioned it every time I saw her for the next month. When I did not give in and add a different middle name or change his name completely, she told me her dad was upset that we honored my dad and his side of the family but didn't honor him at all. I told her again she could always do it. I told my mom and her husband they needed to speak to my sister and tell her to stop mentioning it and I told him to stop letting my sister know he hates not being honored.They didn't listen and just before Christmas my sister came over to tell me yet again that her dad wanted to be honored in my son's name and hates that he wasn't and that he feels hurt.

She dates unemployed losers, f*ck boy types who don't want anything serious, or men who are already in relationships. She becomes over attached to her partners and then gets heartbroken when these relationships don't end well for her, going so far as to play the victim when another woman called her out publicly for sleeping with her fiancé. Our family always pick up the pieces when her relationships end and she goes into massive depressive episodes. I love her, but it can be exhausting, and she never learns from her past mistakes.Her current partner (M26) falls into the unemployed loser category. He's barely worked in his life and spends most of his time playing video games.Despite this, Millie fell pregnant five months into the relationship. They moved in together shortly before the baby was born (he resisted moving out of his parents til the final hour) and they now share a nine month old son. They both love the baby, but the relationship is strained. Millie is on mat leave while he is still unemployed, and  furthermore, he doesn't help around the house with the baby or the chores, leading to Millie being stressed and overwhelmed. I try to help out when I can, but I am running my own business and also live an hour away, so the help I can offer is limited.Anyway, I got engaged to my long-time partner on Christmas Eve and announced the news the following day at Christmas dinner as the entire family was attending. Naturally, my family were ecstatic, but while Millie congratulated me, she looked sad/annoyed for the rest of the evening, and it became obvious her mood had soured.This resulted in the family coddling her all night and asking if she was ok, to which she kept on saying, \"I'm fine,\" while clearly being in a mood, refusing to engage in conversations, snapping at people, etc. At one point, she came back from the bathroom and looked as if she had been crying, so I pulled her aside to asked what was going on.She said the announcement of my engagement on Christmas was stealing her thunder, as it was her baby's first Christmas and her son should be the main focus.  She then accused me of \"rubbing my relationship and happiness in her face\" because I knew things were not good with her relationship.This is the part where I might be an ass. I got annoyed, called her entitled, and asked why she couldn't just be happy for me. She then accused me of not being supportive of her, and I snapped and said it's not my fault you let some loser knock you up; we all tried to warn you. I was also quick to snap because I feel like every family event since she got pregnant has centered around the same drama with her baby daddy.She ended up storming off and leaving with her baby and partner, and now my parents say I need to be the one to clear the air as the eldest sibling.",

I asked him if everything had already been purchased as I would like him to not go. He said yes, and that he was going because it’s something he really wanted to do. We haven’t spoken much since then honestly because I feel very hurt that he doesn’t want to spend time with myself and our children before a long work trip, after he’s just seen his family last week, and would rather spend most of the week with his parents. He says that we could just book flights for myself and our kids to go but we honestly don’t have the money and I’m not maxing out a credit card for an unplanned trip.Tonight he asked me if I will be driving him to the airport tomorrow morning for a 6 am flight. I told him that he will need to book an Uber because I’m not waking our kids up at 3:30 am to drive an hour each way to the airport so that he can go on a trip that I don’t even want him going on. He says that I’m being unreasonable. AITA?",

She is like a toddler in an adult body, is incredibly strong and requires constant supervision.I have a bad back (ruptured disc) so I do this every Christmas against the advise of my doctor, this level of care isn't even something I'm supposed to be doing but i do it because she expects Christmas just as it's always been and has no way of understanding not being able to come home so I push through it even though it causes me horrible pain for days.My elder daughter just brought her first house and wanted to be able.to host Christmas, I felt horrible but told her (even though she was prepared to include her sister) that I could not properly supervise her in her house and she could not handle the disruption to her routine, and expects christmas just as its always been, but that we definitely plan on seeing her new house just after the holidays.She proposed Xmas Eve instead but that's not possible because I have to get the house ready for her sister plus the extra travel to her house (she's over an hour away that travel hurts my back badly and I have to preserve what little energy I have for her sister for Christmas and thought she would understand).

He had started this back when we were in college, and it was never an issue, he always had enough time.

On other days he's doing it online but that's not much better because he still can't give us any time.Last Sunday, I finally spoke out and told him he was neglecting his family. He was offended and told me that he doesn't enjoy having to work so hard but he's doing it for our family. This is where I told him that no, I think he does enjoy it, it gives him an excuse to not spend time with us, and that he was doing this for himself not for us. As things currently stand, our collective income is more than enough, there really was no need for him to add more classes on top of his existing ones, he's doing it for himself at this point.

We were closer in college, but after that we have been drifting apart a little but I still had a strong bond with her up until recently. She has been there for me a lot and I have too so its tough, this situation.After college, when Izzy was like 23, she went on a few dates with Jake (my fiancé) but then told him she wasn't interested in anything serious. Even though I was her best friend, I didn't really know Jake because she used to get asked out a lot, but only a few turned serious. So I knew about her boyfriends, but not necessarily her dates.Almost a year after that, I moved in with Izzy and so we got close again. It was after this that I met Jake. We quickly became good friends. I used to talk about him to Izzy a lot, but its when I showed her his picture that she recognised him and told me about her dates with him. Friendships were more important to me that any guy back then so I  asked her if it was okay to date him because I liked him a lot. She said she had no problem and joked about it ever turning into a relationship, which I took as a joke.Jake and I became serious very quick, he is my soulmate. By then though, Izzy and I  lost touch a bit since I moved in with Jake, and work became more of a priority. Right until I got engaged, she used to still joke to both me and Jake that she didn't think we would be this into each other, and at that time I saw it as funny because Jake is the opposite of me. After I got engaged, she became very weird. She was very shocked, and  would not believe it. Then later she used to tell me I'm too young to be married and if I'm sure, but I saw this as just concern. Although she agreed to be my MOH along with my sister.Afterwards, I posted on my Instagram about our engagement and people were reposting it and congratulating us. But Izzy just captioned it saying \"you better mention me in your vows because he was into me first haha\". Jake felt very uncomfortable, and so did I but I defended her saying that, its just izzy, she jokes around a lot. But I still let her know that it was a bit uncomfortable and she said that she was just joking.After Christmas, we hosted a dinner party and that day, izzy just kept telling all the friends and family gathered that Jake dated her first, she let me have him, stuff like that. Even after telling her it was not okay, she joked around. Later I told her that she was crossing my boundaries and that it was not okay, to which she said I was overreacting. In the end I told her to not attend my wedding at all.I have been overthinking a lot after that. Right now, people who know about this are just choosing sides based on who they know more. I'm worried I'm ruining a lifelong friendship when I'm not even right. What if to her it really was just a joke and I'm not being understanding.

I was the first child in the family born after her death. My mom says she really didn’t want to name me this but my dad strong armed her.This name has been difficult for me in a number of ways. My dad refused to let me go by a nickname all throughout my childhood. The other kids still found ways to mock me. Such as calling me “Phil” and telling me I had a boy’s name. Then in my teens, they’d ask me if I wanted to be “filled”. Now, I know kids can find anything to tease people with but it certainly didn’t help.The larger reason it was hard is I felt like I had to live up to a ghost. It doesn’t help I look just like her. I was constantly reminded of the legacy I had to live up to. Any time I made a mistake, I was told I needed to uphold the honor of the name.Keep in mind, I have always listened to my dad’s stories, learned about the history and I greatly appreciate that I was named after someone so amazing. And I tell my dad this, even though I say I’m not a fan of the name.In college, I decided to reinvent myself and began going by Lissa. In time, people began to assume my name was Alyssa and I just went with it. To the point that’s all my friends, colleagues, etc. called me this. My family was aware but would still call me Phyllis which I accepted for the time. My dad made his disappointment clear but I told him all that mattered is he got to to call me it. I also explained why the name was difficult to me several times, both growing up and as an adult and he told me the meaning behind it was greater than bullies and that I should be honored to have such a legacy.I got married last fall and it was an issue for my dad that the officiant called me Alyssa, that Alyssa was written on all the wedding decorations and invitations. When I went to hyphenate my last name with my husband’s, I also chose to legally change my name to Alyssa. I had my grandmother’s middle name as well my whole life and I kept that as it was never an issue (it’s Marie for those curious).The issue for my dad is that his family has grown used to calling me Alyssa. I never asked them to, but they chose to do so. My dad has said that I was wrong to change my name and that I should feel honored. I tried to explain my reasoning and he said it hurt him that I didn’t care enough.I got mad and said I cared enough to respect him calling me Phyllis and never correcting him. I respected him by always validating his feelings and never telling him he was wrong, while he always brushed mine off. But if he wanted the truth, I wasn’t born to be a reincarnation of his mother. I am my own person and it’s not fair for him to put his grief on me. This really upset him. My mom said I pushed it too far by saying all of that. I feel bad he’s upset but I don’t know if I agree I was wrong. AITA?",

	"body" : "My husband and I have been together for over a decade. During this time he's been in therapy on and off. He had a hard time finding a therapist that was right for him. A few of his therapists early on encouraged him to just medicate (with no regular sessions) and one pushed religion on him. Neither of these worked. What he needed was someone to meet with him semi regularly, not push their religious beliefs on him, and instead work with him to develop appropriate strategies/talk through issues. Whenever he told me about one of these more questionable strategies (i.e. pushing 'just love Jesus') I said I thought that was inappropriate and he should find a better therapist and go without until then.There have been long stretches where he has gone without therapy because my husband isn't generally good at taking care of himself. That falls on me. I have to remind him to do things to keep him healthy/taken care of. Drink water. Eat more than once a day. There are literally times I have had to tell him he needs to brush his teeth. He also gets anxious making any decisions on his own. I have to help him pick out new clothes, write emails to work colleagues or groups of friends. He can't make plans for us- I have to make them all. Or, I should say, I have to help him make the plans so then he can say he made them.He's a good person. He loves me so much. But he is so dependent on me. It is draining. I have to spend an hour at least once a week talking him through whatever crisis he's having. Sometimes this crisis is over what new collectable to buy. A collectable for him. That I do not have any interest in.I finally demanded that he look into therapists again. I told him I can not be his therapist and he cannot depend on me this much. He needs to start taking care of himself and get a therapist that will work with him to develop these skills. And he did! Which is great. However a month into therapy he said his therapist had homework for me. I was supposed to write out a list of all his great qualities- at least a page or two. (Mind you, this is after YEARS of me carrying all his emotional baggage, essentially mothering him, giving him credit for things I did so he could feel better about himself, and one year, I did in fact write out 100 things that I thought were great about him for a gift.)I was so frustrated. I said no. I said therapy is his work, not mine, and I've spent too many years of our lives solving things for him. It wasn't fair to ask me to sit down and do this homework when the point of his therapy was for him to build his own skills without depending on me all the time. He was upset but accepted it, and said he understood. Well, just the other day he told me that his therapist doesn't like me. And thinks I should be thanking and showing him appreciation more. I told him I didn't care what his therapist thought- they are his therapist.This does have me thinking though, AITA for not doing the homework his therapist assigned to me?",

My aunt never got to bring a child home. I feel like I always knew she lost kids. But I never knew her son and I shared a name. It's not a common name either. I never met another person with my name and while I always loved having a unique name, learning the origin of it makes me so uncomfortable.As long as I can remember my aunt has hated my mom and never wanted to be near her. I never got it. My aunt was always nice to me but I could feel how awkward she was around me. I could never figure out why. It was weird because my whole family gave me a nickname and always called me that. The nickname was unrelated to my name and everybody used it for me. That wasn't so weird but I guess I did use to wonder because I remember when they hosted a party last year to celebrate me getting an award for my art, they used my nickname, which is more of a pet name, on the cake, the banner and stuff. It didn't have my first name on it at all.I was talking to my cousin before Christmas. She's my uncle's kid and I asked her why everyone calls me by the nickname and never by my name and she told me it was hard for them to use the name and not think of my cousin. I asked her what she meant and she told me it was a whole drama and mom almost lost her whole family over it. Nobody thought it was kind and our aunt was SO pissed at mom. Apparently mom even told dad that was my name and he got no real say.It made me feel so uncomfortable because every time they hear my name, they think of him and he never got a chance to live and grow. I know naming people after dead family members is a thing and that's fine. But an infant who was stillborn? It feels so gross to have the name. I confronted my parents and mom told me it was no big deal and I shouldn't feel ashamed that my aunt is the one who should be ashamed. I asked mom how she could be so insensitive to her sister.

While I initially agreed with my husband's suggestion to approach our son when his friend leave, I late decided that we should just wait until our son was comfortable sharing this with us. My husband agrued saying what if he never tell us that he's gay. I told my husband that if he doesn't tell us that he's gay then he's probably not. I told him  that we should just let our son know that we'll love him regardless and leave it at that.However, my husband went against our agreement and questioned our son about his sexual orientation while I was driving my son's friend home. When I returned home, I discovered my son in TEARS, yelling and accusing me of outing him. I was confused and told my son that I didn't know what he was talking about.My son told me while he was crying that his father revealed what I saw and basically coerced him into coming out before he was ready. My son asked me why I would I tell his father and why would I enter his room with out his permission. I started crying and told my son that I was sorry and that I loved him and accept him no matter what. My son remained distant and now refusing to speak to me and his father.When I confronted my husband I told him that I was angry that he threw me under the bus. He claimed he didn't mean any harm, only shared what I mentioned to our son hoping it'll make him comfortable about coming out to us. Despite his pleas for forgiveness, I can't help but feel anger towards him knowing my son is now feeling hatred for me of something that I actively tried to prevent.My husband argues that blaming him for our son's emotions is unfair, and told me our son is only going through an emotional phase that will pass. Despite him begging for my son and my forgiveness, telling us that he meant no harm, I'm torn between forgiving him because I blame him for causing our son to be angry with me.ETA: I entered my son's room because I was doing laundry and planning on washing my son's clothes. I did knock to see if they were awake and waited for a response, and when I got no response, I entered. I only usually do this when I plan on washing clothes as I like to do it early in the morning.

But dad convinced me to go. Jared was already at the dinner table and introducing his gf Melody to everyone. He surprisingly didn't make fun off me like he usually does when we first see each other. Now I was told by Jared sister, that Jared shaved all his hair off 2 years ago, because he was getting bald patches and was embarrassed about them.So anyway during dinner, Jared finally turned his attention to me at the time everyone was quite and asked me loudly hey op do you think you will ever put on some weight, you're starting to look anorexic. I just snapped and said I don't know? Do you think you will ever grow hair where your bald patch spots are? He got angry and started cussing at me and I asked him if he had a spare brush for me, so I can brush my hair?! He was told to leave. So him and Melody left. Melody apparently broke up with him that night. Now I'm getting the blame. AITA?",

His family lives in Orlando so we went down to visit. He said he had a surprise planned for me so we got in the car with him and his family and he ended up taking us to Disney World. Ngl, I started crying. I’m not a huge Disney fan anymore but I wanted to go to those parks SO BAD when I was a kid and I was heartbroken that my family couldn’t afford it. When I realized where we were going it felt like I was a little kid again and I was so happy.His mom and sister got annoyed with me for crying and were visibly embarrassed and told me that I’m a grown woman and crying over a theme park. His family has had annual passes for years so they used to go all the time. I tried to explain that I was emotional bc of being too poor to go when I was a little kid but they were standoffish and seemed annoyed with me while we were at the park. AITA?",

	"body" : "My husband and I (gay couple) have a memorial shrine in our home, the urns and photos of both of our fathers and dog are displayed. I kept a large paw shaped locket wrapped around my dogs urn, it was filled with a bit of his fur.My brother,  his wife and 2 kids came over for burgers and hot dogs, soon after I found the locket to be missing.  We searched everywhere,  it was gone. A few days later  my brother calls at 9pm and I mentioned that the locket was missing. He casually mentions that he knows, his 11 year old had \"borrowed\" it.I demanded it back, that he gets off his butt and return it immediately.  He said no, hes tired. I'm angry, go to his house and bang on the door until he opens it and TOSSED the locket at me. It had been opened,  my boys fur was missing from it.I go home and get a call, apparently a neighbor saw me yelling at him and called the cops.  So my brother is mad at me, yet still wants to get together for another BBQ. I told him that he and his daughter will need to apologize to me and my husband,  my brother refused. Saying shes too young to understand that stealing is wrong and it would just traumatize and embarrass her.My husband is super non confrontational and says I'm being an asshole for demanding an apology from a kid, that it won't change anything. The fur is gone and nothing will bring it back. My brother thinks I'm an asshole and 11 year olds dont understand that theft is wrong. I believe an apology is 100% needed, as she stole and damaged something precious to me.So that's where we are. I feel shitty about this and don't know why. Yet I feel that I deserve a sincere apology.So redditors,  who sucks here?Edit- Im calm,  I fully understand that I over reacted, should have waited to pick up the locket during the day time. I shouldn't have yelled at my brother where my niece (may or may not) have heard. Demanding an apology is somewhat pointless if it's not out of genuine remorse. Though I hope they realize they fucked up and do apologize.I'll still host the next BBQ, my brother is a shit but he's still family.Update- I hosted the \"bbq\", but my brother surprised us by bring over curry and katsu. My niece was VERY silent during the day. I later asked her why she took the locket and what she did with the fur. She just wanted to \"borrow\" it but she apparently washed out the fur in the sink.... I guilted her a bit by saying it was special to me, we had Haru for 17 years. How I thought she loved him too, one of the displayed photos is of when she was hugging him as a toddler. She said she did love him but he didn't need it. I remained calm and gave her the locket, telling her that because of her the bit of him that made it special to me was now gone forever. She remained fairly silent throughout the party, no apology ever came.Life is what it is, I just don't want a feud. Hopefully she will have learned something from this event. Though she won't be trusted in my home for a very long time.",

Jane attended every after school activity, graduation and parent-teacher conference . Jane basically raised me and I see her as my second mom.my mom employed Jane as a nanny/ housekeeper from when I was 2 until I was 28, when my mom passed away due to cancer. As a result I inherited everything. My mom was a successful surgeon with her own practice and my grandparents left her with a few properties in her home country. I have since rented the properties out giving me a good rental income.Well after my mom passed away Jane was there for me, she helped me make all of the funeral arrangements and contact relatives from my mom's home country. After she helped me through this difficult time I wanted to do something nice to thank Jane.As a birthday gift I surprised Jane with the deed to a 2 bed, 2 bath house in an area of the country she had always talked about wanting to retire at. Jane tried to decline the gift saying it was too much but I told her she was like a second mother to me and that this was the least I could do for her as thanks for raising me.Well somehow word got back to my dad that I had bought a house for Jane and he turned up at my mom's old practice demanding to talk to me. I didn't even know who the man was as I've seen him less than 20 times in my entire life. He claimed to be my father and yelled at me for buying a house for a stranger\" over someone who is family and says he and his family of 5 have been struggling financially.He even had the audacity to say that I should buy a house for him and my half siblings (who I have never met) because they are my blood family and I owe it to them.I laughed in his face and told him that Jane had been far more involved in my life growing up than he ever had and that I didn't care if he was struggling financially. Security then escorted him to his car and made sure he left the property.My dad's side of the family have now been trying to reach out through Facebook. Complete strangers who I've never met saying I'm an asshole and that my mom never let him be part of my life. I know this is false since I remember my mom calling him over the years, asking him to pick me up on the weekends to spend time with me and he never did.I tried to talk with my friend Aiden 34m about this problem who recently reconnected with his dad who he hadn't seen since he was 6 due to his dad being incarcerated. Aiden told me that my dad probably had a good reason for abandoning me and that I'm the asshole because \"some people don't even have dads\".

We talked it through and I suggested we have a more chill, smaller wedding and save our money for a downpayment on a bigger house. I make significantly more than her (she’s a teacher and I’m a doctor) so I told her I would take care of the majority of expenses like the venue, catering, and planner if she just paid for her dress and smaller stuff like that.Last week her parents hosted a party for us before the wedding and her mom kept making comments about how she can’t believe how small our wedding will be or that we’re not hosting it at the fancy hotel downtown that’s “just so much better and elegant” than what I chose. I even overheard her talking to her sister about how small the diamond is in Emily’s ring and that it’s embarrassing a doctor won’t treat her daughter better (I spent about 5k which I thought was fair).She just seemed so hung up on the fact that her daughter is marrying a doctor but the wedding/ring aren’t on a “doctor level”. Based on what I know, I think she is a little embarrassed about her family’s socioeconomic status, and was hoping her daughter marrying a doctor would help “improve” her image to her friends and extended family.Throughout all of it Emily looked extremely embarrassed and awkward and kept trying to tell her mom it was fine and her mom just said “you need to learn to stand up for yourself”. This is when I just lost it and told her mom she can be uninvited from the wedding if she has so many problems with it and is embarrassed by how “cheap” I am. AITA?",

When it arrived I asked my husband to grab the food while I warmed the baby's bottle and got her food ready. After I walked over to the table where he was unpacking the takeout bags, and he said \"I didn't know you ordered from five guys\", which is when we realized that someone else's food must have been mistakenly delivered to us. We didn't eat it, just set it aside in case someone came.A lady then knocks on our door and asks if we got a five guys delivery. We said yes, but we had already opened it before we realize our mistake, but we hadnt eaten any. She left without a word, talking on her cell phone.About 10 minutes later there was another knock. To my surprise, the police were here and asked if I had ordered take out and if the food was at my door. I explained our mistake, then basically said have a good night and left.I feel bad for opening the food but it was an honest mistake. The police showing up has me questioning myself though.EDIT/UPDATE: Clarifying a few things that came up in the comments : Our food came in a plastic bag. Theirs came in a paper bag. I told my husband the food was here, so he grabbed all the bags and started unpacking. When he opened the paper bag is when he said \"huh i didnt realize you ordered from five guys, too.\" My guess is our food and their food must have been delivered at about the same time, on the photo the drive left of our delivery you can only see one bag. I had thought the driver maybe misdelivered two orders at once.We didn't put it back out because five guys delivers fries just dumped in a bag. The burgers were wrapped up. But it didn't feel right putting them out like no one had touched them. We have a dog and a baby so that seems like a health hazard.Weirdly enough, I was emailed by the landlord of the neighbor who said he has been asked to raise the issue at our HOA meeting that I am a thief who stole their food. The texts he sent seemed to suggest other things were stolen in the past, which obviously we knew nothing about. I'm wondering if that is why the neighbor called the police immediately?And I live in a suburb of a large city on the east coast. The police officer said he just had to follow through and said they were getting a refund, but didn't say anything else. He didn't even ask for our names or anything, just said have a good night and left.",

Lily’s constantly going through her things, takes clothes without asking, breaks stuff, is so loud that Amy can’t do anything and when Amy complains, her parents just tell her to be patient. The final straw was when Lily found a present with a note for Amy from a guy from her class. Lily loudly announced Amy was in love and started reading the note to their parents. Noone knew about him yet and the note was obviously personal (nothing inappropriate) so Amy tried to take it from her. The result was her sister startling and Dan yelling at Amy to let go of her. Amy grabbed the note and ran out of the house straight to me (I live close by)I was at a loss. I said I’d talk to her parents for her and called Sue to let her know Amy was safe and to get her side. Sue asked to come over but Amy didn’t wanna see anyone so Sue said to tell her sorry and that she could stay the nightThe day after we agreed Sue would come alone to talk to Amy. 20 minutes later she shows up with Dan and Lily. Lily apologized to Amy through tears, asking her not to hate her. Amy accepted but looked uncomfortable. Dan then told Amy to apologize for grabbing Lily but she refused. Dan said she had to for them to get along but Amy said she still didn’t wanna go home. After that the screaming started. Dan called Amy a spoiled brat, he never had his own room, Amy said if she can’t stay here she’ll go to friends and stop talking to all of us. Lily kept crying and Sue just ignored everything until Dan declared they needed to get back home to his mom and tried to push Amy out the door. Sue broke them apart and said Dan should take Lily home, she’d handle it. She told Amy she’d make Lily act nicer and asked if that changed anything. Amy said no so Sue said okay, she can stayNo clue what she told Dan but it didn’t work cause he keeps calling and texting. He says I’m basically kidnapping Amy and enabling her \"emotional blackmail\", that I’m teaching her if she runs she’ll get whatever she wants.

He values responsible financial management and, after discussing it with him, I agreed.He’s only a junior in college but he’s earned a decent amount of money through little jobs he’s done here & there, as well as life guarding in the summer. When he needs money for something I give it to him.Originally his account was linked to my bank but in his name that way i can do easy transfers for him when needed.Now, recently his mom (my sister) & her husband somehow bought a house way beyond their means, I really don’t know how they got approved. But now they are drowning in bills and consistently behind. My sister revelry called her son in college and asked him to give them what he has so they can cover some bills. My nephew being the honest kid he is actually told them how much he has saved, upwards of 5k & they wanted all of it.He said no because he’s saving this money for when he graduates so he can buy a car or maybe move out and start his life. My sister then forcefully tried to go to his bank and demand money be withdrawn but she was denied since I am the main account holder. My sister called me and insisted I transfer her the money because it’s her son and she has a right to that money. I stood my ground and said no it’s not fair to take from him and what he’s worked for, especially since I know for a fact they won’t pay him back. My nephew offered them a compromise of giving them 1k free and clear but they want all of it & I refuse to release it as my nephew has told me he doesn’t want to.Now my sister has called our mom & entire family to make me look like a controlling bitch and saying how i am trying to parent her son and teach him bad manners and not to help family. She’s telling everyone I should give her control of the money cause it’s her son.So, AITA for standing my ground and refusing to give my sister access to her teenage son's money, even though he and I both think it's in his best interest to have responsible financial oversight?

I am the one managing the account and she demands I transfer control over to her so they can use the money for real expensesUpdate: To add some additional info on why I still am a custodian on the account. The account was opened when he was 15 because his parents would always take any money he was given like for Christmas or birthdays. I am still on the account because he does not want me off till he finishes school and can move away from his parents for good",

The birth is supposed to be in March.In July, my brother and father are going on a three-week bike tour of some Nordic countries. His girlfriend will be left alone to care for the baby as well as the house, the vegetables, the garden, and all their animals (a flock of sheep and a dog). Her family lives abroad and while my brother's mother will be able to come by occasionally to help, she won't be able to stay the whole time as her health is poor and she's elderly. It should be noted that the girlfriend herself has a heart condition and a mid-risk pregnancy (the baby is fine).I recently overheard my brother and father talking together about the trip, with my brother saying that his girlfriend always knew that trip was in the cards since it was my brother's present to himself for his 40th birthday, and he \"told her so since they first met\". When I later tried talking to them separately about postponing the trip a year or so, that was the same reason I got. I pointed out that the baby wasn't planned and should take priority over a trip, but they both got defensive and said I was welcome to go help her if I cared so much. The problem is a) I work, b) I'll already be caring for my elderly grandmother while my father is away on said trip, and c) I can't stand babies and they know that.I called my brother selfish and immature. My father said I was being too judgmental as usual.ETA: The girlfriend is not fine with the trip. She's a first-time mom who knows nothing about babies and is very anxious about childbirth and childrearing, especially since she has no support system here. I don't know whether she and my brother had a conversation that prompted the one between my brother and father about the trip, but she's a traditional and selfless person who frequently does too much for others even when she suffers from it. That's also why I'm worried about her.ETA 2: Well, RIP my inbox. I read and appreciate everyone's feedback, though I can't answer all of you.

The comments said that me asking him to adhere to the boundaries we established was reasonable. Some comments also suggested that I should not have implied that he works just to get away, so I was a little apologetic as well. After he came back I decided to talk to him about this.The conversation was a bit of a trainwreck. I brought up the fact that our income far exceeds ur current and projected expenses. That me and our son were missing him, and needed him to spend more time with us, and I made sure to stress that I appreciated all that he did.It just seemed like we were on completely different wavelengths. He said he kept on taking more lessons and students because he wanted us to have a good standard of living, have better vacations, better schools, a second house. I was dumbfounded. I never knew he felt that way. I stressed our current standard of living was great, we make enough money, and that if he thinks that way there's no end in sight. What if he decided we should also have a third house or something? Right now I needed him with me.At this point, I kind of lost control and started crying. I didn't mean to, it wasn't something I wanted to do to pressure him or anything, just the fact that we were at an impasse was wrecking me. I told him I'd been feeling unhappy, that I kept compromising and he reneged on it. After some more crying and consoling, my husband agreed that Sunday should have remained off-limits. He gently asked me to give him a pass for one more Sunday, because his students exams end next week, and he would make Sunday untouchable the following semester onwards. He also promised to try to resize his classes in order to be able to come back home for dinner even if it's late dinner. He asked for time to do all this.

My niece’s mother died when she was less than a year old and the trip was going to be the first time my niece would be visiting her mother’s home country. As well as the second time she gets to see her maternal grandparents since her mother’s death.However my niece suffers from attachment issues which cause her to have severe anxiety. As a result she has panic attacks whenever she goes to unfamiliar places without her dad or I present. Short trips to nearby places are fine with just her dad but because this trip will be for a month and somewhere faraway that is very different from what she's used to, I have to be present for the trip to happen.I had agreed to the trip about a year ago under the pretense it would likely happen in July of this year. Last month my boyfriend(26M) asked me to spend two weeks with him and his family in Italy during August, I agreed as it wouldn't interfere with my niece's trip. However, last week my brother told me that he could only get time off for the last two weeks of July and first two of August during summer vacation. Which interfere with the trip to Italy. My boyfriend can't reschedule as it is the only time that works for his family. I asked my brother about moving niece's trip to sometime during the schoolyear but she has recitals and events that she can't miss.Originally I was planning on missing the trip to Italy but after speaking about it with my boyfriend's sister, she hinted at my boyfriend proposing to me during the trip. My boyfriend and I have been together since we were in high school, and a large reason why we aren't engaged yet is because my niece's dependency on me. He's been more than understanding towards the situation which would make me feel awful if I delayed his proposal for my niece again. To be honest, I'm also tired of having to put my life on hold for my niece, so I told my brother I couldn't go on the trip with them. Which essentially meant he had to cancel the tip. He was very mad at me, probably the most mad I've seen him since niece was born and called me an asshole as well as some other choice words for accepting to go on another trip when I had already agreed to this one. I was taking my niece to therapy this week, and the therapist pulled me aside to tell me how much my decision was hurting my niece. She didn't sound like she was blaming me but it made me start to rethink my decision. I brought it up with a few friends and the reactions were mixed.So AITA?",

So Terry asked me to leave as he was standing up and already going out. I said that we would see the rest back home, and we left. No problem, right?That night, my mother came to me and told me she was concerned about my \"choice\" in a partner, and she was afraid that his \"condition\" would make him a bad partner. I explained that it was no bother to me, and Terry does more for me than I do for him, and that I assure her everything is fine. That was not enough for my mother, so she brought up me being his caretaker. I told her I am not. Terry is a grown man, and he takes care of himself. I just support him. Still, that was not enough. My mother kept pressing me, kept bringing up the same three lazy arguments. And then... I blew up. I told her I would not take criticism on my partner choice from a woman who married my father. She told me I was awful and left. Has not talked to me since. My brother said I was right, but I still should not have said it.AITA?",

My aunt is old enough to be in menopause and there is a box of tampons in a box on the back of my toilet. My massager and my “boyfriends” are in the bottom of that specific drawer under my makeup bag.

	"body" : "It bothered me a lot, when Jasmine is so kind, intelligent and has decided to be a pediatric surgeon. Her interest in medicine started when she was very young after I was babysitting her and Chloe and she saw all the books and anatomical displays in my office (I’m a Cardiologist). Just over a year ago, Tanha asked if I would be interested in adopting Jasmine as she couldn’t keep up with trying to raise two kids. I said I would only agree if that was what Jasmine wanted, I didn’t want to make such a change without her input. She was 14, not two. Jasmine was overjoyed and eagerly agreed to the adoption; I did make sure to have her in therapy. Here is where I may be the AH. Four months ago, a position opened up in Sweden. I talked it over with Jasmine and she was super excited and it would also put her in far better schools. So, after getting my work visa and filling out the paperwork we prepared for the move. Jasmine was chattering to all of her teachers and classmates about the move, and it did draw quite a lot of attention to her. I later had an angry Tanha, Jason and Chloe on my doorstep. They demanded to know why I was moving their daughter away from her family across the world, and throwing so much money on her education, clothing and electronics when I didn’t do the same for Chloe. I got mad, and this is where I may have overstepped. I snapped that they’d lost their right to claim Jasmine when they neglected her and threw her to the side just because Tanha couldn’t handle the fact that she and Chloe had twin siblings. That Jasmine deserved her chance to make her life the way she wanted it and that Tanha and Jason spoiled Chloe more than I ever did. So yes, I was favoring Jasmine because she needed someone on her side. Tahna broke down in tears, Chloe doing the same while sobbing and crying out that I hated her before they left as Jason called me a bitch for destroying his family. We didn’t hear anything more from them as we packed, and we moved three months ago. Jasmine thankfully wasn’t home for that conversation though I did tell her as I don’t believe in keeping secrets like that when she had a right to know. She cried but thanked me for not giving up on her or forgetting her. I’ve gotten several calls from our extended family berating me for moving and tearing Jasmine from her family calling me selfish and cold. I can’t help but worry I went too far. Am I an asshole?",

She will do homework last minute and often ask for extensions with work.She had a tendency to remind me to pay for school related things like lunch money, just before I’m going to bed, or that she needs to take something into school so can we run to the store and quickly get it.Last month, I went on a wild goose chase to help Mia locate ingredients for her home econ class, after she told me at half 10 she needs xyz ingredients and she just checked the fridge and we don’t have it.She was reading the ingredients of an email, and when I saw it was dated a week prior, got annoyed Mia couldn’t have told me before when we did the big food shop for the family.I told her the next time she needs something for school to tell me the day she gets told or the day after latest, or I will not be helping her out.My husband has stopped helping Mia with her last minute requests and calls me a pushover for helping her out, but when she asked today to put down the deposit for a school trip I put my foot down.Mia has known since the start of the school year she had a school trip to Germany. Her school sent an email out two months ago asking for deposits for kids to secure their place on trip. It’s is about 150, and Mia asked me today to pay as the deadline is midnight or she may not be able to go.I reminded her what I said last time about deadlines and organisation and as she chose to tell me last minute I will not be paying for her deposit. She got upset as all her friends from history class are going.I told Mia that she can pay herself from her savings as she has a part time job, which is more than enough to cover her deposit, but she wanted to save up to buy a new game console.I told her to pick if she wanted to go on the trip or get a new game console and she called me an AH, and now I’m wondering if I’m being unreasonable. My husband is on my side but my youngest said it was mean and Mia is very upset with me.ETA- Mia doesn’t have ADHD, but she is dyslexic so this does explain the schoolwork sometimes, but she will ask for extensions on top of her extensions which is a sore spot for her and my husband who wants her to be more organised and not leave work last minute.Mia has been tested for ADHD and doesn’t not have it, I did my research at the time and realised it often gets overlooked for girls but even after getting another opinion she doesn’t have ADHD. She gets help from a school advisor regarding her dyslexia and at home we have discussed strategies to help her stay on track with her responsibilities.",

Me and my husband spent most of our time together and around 8pm my friend left no one was speaking to me and my husband much at that point. 9pm rolls around and i get out of my dress and start trying to pack things up so then there wasn't much that needed to be done at the end of the night.WELL thats when SIL(48 F) realizes we're leaving and my husband is currently playing with my son (who is 5 years old) and his cousin too preoccupied to hear his sister scream at me asking if we're leaving, like she was in severe shock. She screamed at me 3 times until she then stormed out and well threw a tantrum, my husband tried to go and calm her but that didn't work and she continued cried when i let my husband know that the uber is here and we gotta go. I was exhausted and extremely annoyed at this point after being screamed at and completely exhausted i just wanted to leave so i shouted to my husband that im leaving with or without him. i know wasnt my brightest moment but i was tired especially with my body clock not changing either, We left and now his sister is mad, her husband is mad and  decided the wedding video he took of us. He said we can't have because i was \"immature\" for not staying a little longer when i saw SIL was upset. I do understand her being upset but at the same time could she not of pulled us aside and had a civil conversation with us rather than screaming at me and throwing a tantrum like a child.",

They grew up in a small town that very few people get out of and my mom was the quintessential popular girl and my dad the smart guy that should've gotten out. As you can imagine, becoming parents at 17 was not easy for them, but I truly believe they did the best they could. However their relationship was always challenging, my Mom was happy to stay in her hometown but my Dad had always hoped for more. We never really became a \"normal nuclear family\", Dad never married my Mom, they lived apart, and I never had siblings, all of which is an especially sore point for my mother. He's still an amazing father, I always felt he was there for me, even though some nights I know he was dog-tired he would still patiently teach me physics. He provided for my Mom and I, doing back-breaking work to now owning his own construction company, dude paid for my college in full. He told me that any college I could get into, he would sponsor my ambitions.A couple years ago, my Dad met Anne (33F) who use to be my mentor during my college internship, now job. My Mom has not been handling any of this well, she accused my father of trying to replace her with a new stepmom for me, despite that I was almost 20 at the time when Dad and Anne met. When Dad and Anne got engaged and married, mom accused Anne of stealing her life. When they moved out of state to their dream home, Mom accused Anne of being a gold digger. Last month, I found out that Dad & Anne are 4 months pregnant with a girl. Mom found out last week and has been unconsolable. I'm really trying to be empathetic, but her reaction has been so out of proportion,  accusing Anne of stealing my inheritance. I've listened to her for the last 4 years, playing armchair therapist for her issues with Dad, but yesterday I finally hit my limit and told Mom that she really needed to move on from her personal issues with Dad and find a purpose outside of trying to build a life with him because it obviously wasn't going to happen.

She also suggested that we need to respect each other's privacy by knocking on each other's doors before entering.So for about a year now we have had our own bedrooms and to my surprise, I have been enjoying it a lot. We still sleep together a few times a week, but do spend the majority of the nights separately. I have really enjoyed the privacy and having the opportunity to unwind by myself without having to worry about anything else. But my wife on the other hand doesn't seem to be enjoying it as much. She has started spending more nights with me in my bedroom which is fine. But she has now started acting like we don't have any agreements at all. At first she was very adamant about knocking on each other's doors before entering each other's rooms and would frequently call me out on it if I didn't. But now she has started acting like my separate bedroom is her bedroom and she doesn't knock before entering my room like we agreed to.When I called her out on it, she got really emotional and angry with me. She told me that I didn't care about her and I didn't want to have her around anymore. She also said that it really hurts her feelings.

I was a broken man afterwards and withdrew from all of my friends and family.After a couple of years, I started meeting people again and eventually found out the ex was in a relationship with the affair partner and living with him. This broke me again so I went back to my isolation. Another year passed and I slowly came back out. It took some time before I could talk about my past but when I was able to, my brothers lit a fire under me. I found out through friends that the ex moved in with the father of the boy almost immediately after our divorce was finalized and they have been together ever since. My brothers pushed me to talk to their attorney friend which I eventually did. He’s a business attorney but listened to my history then gave me his opinion. He then recommended me to his friend in a family law firm.In short, I paid almost 4 years of child support and according to my attorney, I have a good chance of stopping the child support payments and recovering at least some or possibly almost all of it because there is social media evidence that the boy was living with his biological father during that time. The attorney said that we can nail down the exact date they lived together during discovery then we’ll have a better picture of how much we can ask for.

And at last new year (2022/2023) i forgot the key in the showcase and he played with my amiibos, just playing tho, would have been fine, but he ripped them off the bases, damaging a few (link became legless) i complained and asked forher to pay me back for the damaged ones, but she just ridiculed it and brushed it off.So this year out of a small ammount of spite, i didnt invite her. No one at the party even seemed to notice.Today, i get the angry text, saying that she really likes my party and its a shame i forgot she was my friend and why didin't i invite her. i said it was because of what happened last year, that i didn't want her child near my collection again. she said i was childish (wich i admit that regarding some aspects of my personality and regarding damaging my stuff, i am) and said i was an AH and that that wasn't a reason to not invite someone and that her child was just playing.Some friends say that it's ok, that it's understandable (even my two other friends with kids that have known me for years understand) and others agree that im the AH.

She's 10 years older than I am and really had no expectations when it came to me as a mom. She predicted I would end up single and my son's dad would bail and that I would give up within the first year. Instead we are married and we had two little girls after our son.We are very different parents. My sister is very strict and regimented as a mom and has a lot of rules and \"swift, harsh punishments\" for bad behavior or any subpar behavior. My husband and I would probably fall more into a gentle parenting kind of deal. We teach our kids how to act in public but we do so in a very different way to my sister and her husband.My nephew can be very challenging and he's an angry little boy. I suspect it's because his parents are often angry and he is picking up on that and building resentment which has made his behavior worse. Our parents have brought this up to my sister in the past and she has told them it's not true and claimed my son behaves far worse despite them saying it's not even close to the truth.Our parents had both boys on Saturday and my sister and I arrived at the same time to pick them up. Our parents elderly neighbor approached my sister and told her that she should have a word with her son because of how rude and disrespectful he is to others. My sister told the neighbor that she had the wrong sister and my son was the kid who gets into trouble. The neighbor said she knows the boys apart and knows who the mom to each is. She told my sister that my son was very sweet and showed no disrespect the way her son did. My sister was furious.The neighbor told her that thanking someone (my son) for picking something up for her does not warrant being yelled at and cursed at by a small child. Apparently my nephew got an attitude and told her nobody has to help her because she's old and can't do anything for herself. My sister went off on the neighbor and said her son is so much better behaved and accused her of spreading lies.The neighbor walked away mid tirade and then my sister started to turn on me and instead of letting her I said she needs to stop being so bitter and examine her parenting instead of going off on people who complain about her son's behavior. I told her I would not let her take it out on me that she was wrong about me as a mom and that I feel like a lot of her anger comes down to that. That she hates that I don't get the same comments. She tried to yell at me but I just got my son off our parents and left. My parents asked me what happened and I told them.

When i saw what the kids did, I told them they cant be in my room and took them back to the lounge and closed the door. I spoke to my mum in private first about what happened and told her I will speak with them I was angry but I remained calm. When I first approached my cousin and his wife I to them this is what they did and it's not okay. My exact words were \"mum told the kids not to go in there and they did. They destroyed my book boxsets and some of my games are all over the floor. Please may you ask them to clean this up? Because they messed it up.\" He told me they were just kids and that it happens, i should have put the stuff away knowing they were coming over. That is when I lost it and told him, it's my home and I shouldn't have to hide my stuff for his \"Barnyard animals\" and if he can't control them then maybe he should leave. He told my mum and dad that I was raised poorly to talk to elders this way, dad said sorry, mum said I was right.",

For me it's weird because 1) I don't consider it THAT ground-breaking and 2) they're doctors, shouldn't they be more USED to that? However, I usually don't say much about it.Anyway cue doctor Jane who was supposed to remove my wax for the day. I scheduled an appointment SPECIFICALLY for that.

I comply, foolishly imagining it's gonna be relevant to my problem but she begins talking about my cleft lip and how great the result is and wants to examine my nose point at which I stop her. I tell her there's nothing wrong with my nose and ask her if she suspects there might be an infection spreading to my ears or something.

Meanwhile I got up from the chair and started to get my stuff to leave. She said that there's no need to react like that and all she did was try to help me. I explained all the help I needed from her was with my ears and if I need more, I'll let her know. By then I was already dressed with the hand on the door handle.She kept telling me this is no way of behaving and I'm disrespectful to her. I (almost) snapped but told her as calmly as I could that for me this is not an \"interesting case\", but a lifelong condition and I'm not fond of people pointing fingers at it. I explained to her I find it unprofessional and rude. I then just left to avoid further conflict. Was I wrong?",

Her theme for bridesmaids was a sunset, so she asked us all to wear yellow/orange/pink dresses to match the theme.I went to my brother’s wedding a few years ago and my SIL’s bridesmaid theme was a yellow dress. It is a beautiful dress and was very expensive for me as a college student. My brother agreed to pay more than half which made it a lot more affordable but that dress isn’t wearable outside of special occasions and I’ve only worn it once outside the wedding.I told Ava I had a dress for her wedding when we were out with a friend and my friend asked oh is it the one you wore for SIL’s and brothers wedding? So I said yeah and showed them a picture of me in the dress.Ava then said she would want me to get a new dress for her wedding as I’ve worn my yellow one before and people have seen it. I was confused by this as even if people have seen it it doesn’t matter?My SIL was the year above me in school so we do share mutual friends that I saw at her wedding and some of them will be at Ava’s wedding but I don’t want to buy a brand new dress. Bridesmaid dresses are expensive and I don’t get wear out of them afterwards so they sit in my closet.I haven’t been to many weddings though, only my brothers that I remember and a few cousins when I was much younger so maybe this is some wedding etiquette that I need to brush up on?",

	"body" : "I (51f) am the second youngest child of 8. Growing up there was a constant unfairness and favoritism between my siblings from my parents. My sister “Cathy”, who I am 18 months apart from, and I would always get the short end of the stick when we were younger. Cathy and I got pulled out of private school and put into public high school so my parents could pay for my older sister’s university. In high school, I participated in many things like ASB and swimming, but my parents never showed up for anything or give us rides to school so we had to walk. When it came time for applying to college, my parents only gave Cathy and I two options: community college or a university that my two older brothers went to.In 2015, my dad (82m) was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. When his condition got worse in 2016, I would visit daily. He passed away in late May of 2016. After he passed, the favoritism from my mom got even worse since my dad would normally mitigate it.Fast forward to 2021, my mom (83f) began planning on how her possessions would be dispersed after she passes. She called all of the siblings up to her house so that we could make lists and plan on who received what. Many people wrote lengthy lists that she promised they would receive. I wanted a few sentimental items, photos of my parents, and a specific ring that my mother owns called the ‘mother’s ring’ that has the birthstones of all of her children. When I gave her my list, she told me that if I wanted the ring, it would be the only thing I would inherit, and beforehand she would remove it’s stones and give them to other siblings. This sparked an emotional argument, as I asked for much less than other people, and she said I didn’t deserve more. We started bringing up things from the past, with me mentioning how she mistreated me, and she completely blew me off. I then tearfully told her I wished she had died instead of our father, because he would have treated his children much more fairly in this situation. This hurt her greatly because she has never recovered from the loss of her husband, and despite her behavior she does love all of her children.After this happened, our relationship was never the same. We didn’t speak for many months and every time I would see her, I would only say hello and goodbye. She hasn’t apologized for what she has done in the past or about the mother’s ring. I do feel like what I said was harsh but I won’t apologize for it since I think someone needed to give her a reality check for how bad she has treated some of the siblings and it was a moment of pent up resentment I held down for many years.Even now, my mom’s plan is to only give me the mother’s ring with no stones in it and nothing else.So, AITA?",

When she was 7 her mom got diagnosed with cancer so I started to help out with raising her. Her and Ed were best friends so it was easy. When she was 10 her mom passed away so I took over all duties of raising a daughter. She started to date my son in college and they got married later on.I genuinely look at her as my daughter because I basically raised her (her dad drank himself to death when she was 19) with my family. Like she would spend all the holidays like school breaks and go with us to holidays ect.When they got married they bought the house 4 houses down and has been living there.Now Cat is very sweet she can cook well and we bond in the kitchen and we get along great. But I really don’t like being called Mom by her I don’t know why but I just don’t. I don’t like it when people or children call me Aunty or nicknames ect. I don’t mind Edna calling me Mom because I feel like I raised her and earned that title.I have talked to her and my son many times about this. It makes me uncomfortable and she says it shouldn’t. That it is awkward for her to call me by my first name.This new years dinner she made it a point to call me mom in every sentence and I was annoyed. I pulled her aside and told her to knock it off and she said it’s not fair that Edna can call me mom but she can’t. I told her that i raised Edna so it makes sense. Edna has no family other than us but you have a huge family with a mom that loves you very much.She said that she feels like I’m rejecting her from the family and I told if after all I have done for you and this is the thing that makes you feel isolated then you need help to be grateful. ( for context Among other things I paid half of her college loans and helped her pay for the house they live in.)She said that I’m a bitch and Edna can be my favorite DIL and it’s creepy that I will bbsite pups and not my gdkids because she and Sam won’t ever come back. I told her to get out and be a brat somewhere else. Sam got involved and dragged Cat away.Cat lives 6 hours away and I can’t drive well and they don’t have gust bed for me to stay the night. I pay 25% in childcare tho. E and I have spa days once a month a tradition since she was a teen. So when Cat comes we all go for a spa trip and i always pay.Sam sent me text asking me to apologize because it’s such a small thing and that cat is serious about her threat.I left him on read because I didn’t think I need to apologize.Even my grandchildren call me by my name. They rarely call me grandma and they like calling me by my name.Actually Edna doesn’t call my mom often. She does sometimes but she always uses my name because she knows I’m comfortable with it. If Cat called me mom one of I don’t mind. It’s just ever single sentence that’s directed to me ends or starts with mom and I feel so uncomfortableAITA?",

	"body" : "My girlfriend (f29) and I (m29) were going to host thanksgiving dinner last year, we had everything planned and we invited our closest family members (her parents, my parents, my siblings and my sisters family). Unfortunately we had some health issues concerning my girlfriend's pregnancy, even though she was 31 weeks pregnant just a few days before thanksgiving, she had to have an emergency C-section. I won't go into too much detail with that since it's irrelevant, but the thing is that we cancelled dinner, my gf and our baby had to be in the hospital for a bit.My girlfriend and I decided to just stay home during Christmas and new year's eve dinner too, as she was still recovering from the surgery and we honestly didn't feel like doing much. However, since she's feeling better now she thought that it would be a good idea to have a family dinner now, to make up for all of our missed holidays this year.Long story short, we planned a dinner for yesterday. My girlfriend and I are vegan, usually she doesn't mind too much being around cooked meat, but we prefer to not have it in our home. My sister (f35) is married and has two kids (both boys under 10).My girlfriend and I cooked for everyone, and when our families came, my sister's husband asked where the real food was after we told them what we've cooked (all vegan dishes). My gf is a little oversensitive still, so I took my family aside and kindly asked them to not make any harsh comments like that. They said they'll be careful and my sister's husband apologised.However, as I was finishing cooking some of our food, someone rang the bell. My sister said \"oh, it must be the delivery for the kids\" and yeah, it was. She had ordered fried chicken for her kids since they surely won't like what my gf and I cooked. That caused a big argument between me and my sister, since she didn't tell me that she was ordering chicken (which I wouldn't have allowed). The discussion escalated and I ended up asking my sister and her family to leave, after that my parents also got upset with me and they left as well. We ended up having dinner just with my in-laws and my brother.I feel like I did something wrong because now my parents or sister don't want to talk to me unless I apologize for \"being an extremist\", but I was only trying to keep my girlfriend comfortable and happy in her own house?

	"body" : "For context my wife and I have been together for more than a decade. In that time her family has been awesome. The only exceptions to this are my wife’s paternal aunt and uncle.The two have a tendency to do really odd things and then act like it was normal. For instance, a few years ago they stood up during the middle of a family dinner, raised their hands like a ref holding up a champion boxers hand, and announced that they were moving to “The Lake” before sitting down.No mention of which lake this was, no additional context, nothing. After what felt like an eternity as we all stared at each other awkwardly, my wife’s father asked “Which lake?” which prompted his sister to begin bawling her eyes out and screeching about how we weren’t being supportive.More recently my wife and I bought a house in the same city as her parents. And so for the first time, we decided to host Christmas. The grandparents and parents are getting old, and we thought it would be a nice gesture. We made sure to send the invites a month in advance and followed up by text message with everyone who said they were coming.The only thing we asked was that people not bring their pets. My wife has absolutely terrible dog allergies (to her own dismay as she desperately wants to foster a dog) and her aunt and uncle have a history of doing things like showing up with a literal pack of dogs they happen to be petsitting “last minute” for.The email was very clear on this.Cue Christmas Day and my wife’s aunt and uncle showing up two hours late with their brand new Mastiff. When I opened the door, the dog started going nuts and howling, while her uncle scolded it to stop. I tried to politely explain that this wasn’t acceptable and that they needed to leave, but my wife’s aunt started crying and screaming about how mean I was being.Eventually they left, but on the day of and for the last few weeks since I’ve gotten mixed reactions from family and friends. I’m not on Facebook, but apparently my wife’s aunt made a long post about how we ruined Christmas by forcing (?) them to drive two hours for Christmas dinner, only to turn them away heartlessly because they didn’t feel comfortable leaving their new dog at home alone.Our immediate family is supportive. Both of my wife’s grandmas thought the scene was hilarious, apparently, and my in-laws thought it was nice to finally see someone stand up to “the loony tunes duo” (their term, not mine), but think we should have found a way to allow them to stay even with the dog. The other aunts, uncles, and cousins think we went too far and should have compromised somehow.I feel like I’m taking crazy pills, so I have to ask. Am I the asshole?EDIT: It has been pointed out that my spelling of bawling was incorrect. It has been fixed.EDIT 2: There are a number of folks wanting to know more about ”The Lake”. I was trying to not tell this story, since it would bias things towards them looking even crazier (and I wanted the Christmas dinner situation to be judged fairly on its own), but here’s the deal.My wife’s aunt and uncle have always wanted to own a lake house. They literally had framed photos and posters all around their house of different lake front properties. We all knew this for years.What we didn’t know was that they were actively looking. Nor did we know they had put on offer on the one that, in their mind, was their dream lake house.However, they believed that they had been keeping everyone in the loop. This meant when they stood up and triumphantly announced their success, they thought we were going to cheer and congratulate them. So when my wife’s dad asked which lake, it was like him (and everyone else by extension) forgetting about/not giving a damn about them achieving their dream.After my wife’s aunt calmed down, we finally got them both to explain why they were so upset. Except they couldn’t provide any documentation of having told anyone.They hadn’t spoken to anyone in the family by phone since before they put the offer in. They also didn’t have any text messages, emails, or even Facebook posts showing they had told us. What we gathered by the end was that they had told a mutual family friend and somehow expected us to know by extension.So yeah, there’s the story of “The Lake”.",

A while ago, my boyfriend and I were hanging out with mutual friends and my boyfriend suggested in front of everyone that I do a portrait as a gift for someone's upcoming birthday. While it was a little annoying to be volunteered by him, I did think it was a good gift idea and went ahead and did it. The next time a birthday in the group came up, my bf made the same suggestion and as a result \"the birthday portrait\" has kind of become my thing. My boyfriend will get something small as his gift since he views the portrait as being \"from us.\"The part where I may be the asshole here is that I haven't told him explicitly to stop volunteering me for these portraits. It is my fault for going along with the birthday gift thing for our friends without saying anything, but I kind of assumed that he would at least keep these requests within the realm of common sense.Well...his college buddy is getting married, and my boyfriend told him that I would make him a portrait of him and his bride as a wedding gift. I have never even met this person! To make matters worse, he apparently made this promise weeks ago but only told me about it today, and the wedding is this Saturday. I finally lost it at him and told him that I'm not his personal portrait sweatshop, and that he only does this because he's a cheapskate and it gets him out of spending any money on a gift, even though it costs me a lot of time.He argued back that a bespoke portrait is so much better than just buying something off the resume, that it's a generous thing for me to do, it helps build my portfolio, and that I don't get very many paid commissions anyway. For the record—I don't get many paid commissions because I don't charge peanuts for them. I have a full time job, so I price according to what would be worth giving up the amount of free time that it takes me.He told me that I put him in a really difficult position, that he hyped up the portrait, and they were both really looking forward to it. He said please just do this one and I won't ask again. I said no, I don't even know these people, this is so not my problem.He looked up a couple of portrait artists online, but none of them were willing to do the piece on the short turnaround he needed + at the quality he wanted + at the price he was willing to pay. He even tried using an AI image generator—which was a complete slap in the face to me as an artist—but all of the outputs were very obviously AI. He's begging me to please just do this one and he will make it up to me on my birthday, but (especially after he apparently thought my work was so worthless that it could be effortlessly reproduced by a machine), I'm just really not in the mood.",

And she needed me to be her rock and I was a little too solid and literal with her.I called her and explained my side and even linked the post to her, we cried over FaceTime and I told her I was so very sorry for making her feel like she didn’t have any support.I’ll be accompanying her to her  follow up next week. She needs to know she’s loved and cared for right now so that’s what I’ll do for her.And for the strange amount of you who are asking if I am on the spectrum or assumed it and to the one person who sent me a test, yes I am.Post mortem - My final thoughtsMy sister has read your comments, and she appreciates the kindness. She is feeling better, we have been helping her figure out her next steps. In this case and in our state, the state health department is going to help her press charges because after contacting the person she was involved with, they were aware of the situation and proceeded anyhow.To the comments that asked about symptoms or how she knew; fatigue, long lasting flu symptoms and swollen lymph nodes. But you should always get checked, know your status. Not only to protect yourself but to protect others. And if possible, start PREP.To those of you who feel as if HIV is a deserved punishment, I honestly hope you can be perfect all of the time and never have any lapses in judgement. I hope you can tell when people are lying or being dishonest and be that much better than the rest of us.I have a weird amount of Vulcan and robot comments and I’d like to laugh?

The feeder wasn't on a timer, it was just a bottle that dispensed food with gravity whenever the tray got empty. I told her that I really wasn't comfortable letting her have constant access to food at her weight. She said (paraphrasing here) \"Look, she's still my cat and you don't get to make that call. Either tell me you're going to stick to the plan or tell me you won't and I'll find someone else.\" I agreed, but admittedly I wondered I would be able to follow through on my word for a whole year.I lasted...maybe a week? Having Juno around all day every day made it extremely clear how much she was suffering because of her weight. She struggled to even hop up on my couch. I took the feeder away and started feeding her 1 can of wet food in the morning and 1 can in the evening. I work from home, so the adjustment period of constant yowling for food was an absolute nightmare, but...it worked.

She demanded that I go back to the old way. I said honestly...I'm sorry but I really don't think I can bring myself to do that. I was like, I know that when she is back with you that you are going to do what you will, but while she is under my roof I can't just let her gorge herself on food all day when it's clear that she can eat normally and lose weight, that would be neglect.My friend called around to see if any other friends or family would take her for the remaining 4ish months, but no one could/wanted to. She is extremely upset with me and says that when she is back in the US, she is taking her cat back and this friendship is over. It hurts, but I accept it.

My baby shower after was ok then, but I missed Sara for most of it.I checked my phone today to find Sara upset that I kicked her out and embarrassed her in front of all our friends and a text from Ted saying he got my number from Sara and as he heard Amy’s partner was coming he thought he could come too.",

	"body" : "(Throw away account just in case.) The title may seem like a given but it’s not apparently. About 9 months ago my current wife (40F) and I (43M) hired a nanny. I have 7 kids, 4 from my previous marriage and 3 from my current. Anytime we go on vacation I plan it around when I my other kids are going to be in our custody so we can all go. Our nanny comes with us as well, as was discussed when she was hired. The problem actually starts when my youngest from my previous marriage (7F) returned to her moms and (apparently) all she talked about was the nanny. My ex-wife accused me of “abandoning” our kids onto our nanny even though I don’t, they just like hanging out with her (yes she is paid extra for the other kids). Every time my kids go back to their moms, she calls and texts me, infuriated. It all came to a head when I discussed going on a cruise with the kids, my wife, and the nanny over the summer because I have custody of them the entire summer. My ex-wife called me, calling me selfish, mean-spirited, a horrible father, etc. She said I should’ve invited her instead of our nanny, because she’s their real mother and the kids already like the nanny more than her, what will happen in 3 months? And I \"never did things like these when we were married\" even though I made significantly less money back then. Even my parents and some of my family are agreeing that taking our nanny and not the kids mom is “ridiculous”. So, AITA? Should I have at least offered her to go?",

	"title" : "AITA for cancelling my sister’s visit even though her therapist said she needed a vacation?",
	"body" : "About three years ago, my stepsister Daphne got pregnant. She and her husband Jim were thrilled, but found out at the 20 week scan that the baby had a congenital condition and would be born severely disabled (apologies if these are insensitive terms, I am not sure how people prefer to say it?). Daphne decided to keep going with the pregnancy despite Jim’s protests and they split up, but got back together by the time their son Liam was born. He is now 2 years old.Over the last two years, Daphne’s (and Jim’s) mental health has declined significantly. Daphne used to be a positive and pleasant person, but now it’s impossible to have a conversation with her. She is malicious, envious, and flies off the handle at any perceived slight. When I was having my child, I didn’t speak to her for most of the pregnancy because of how bitter and narcissistic she was. We don’t live close to Daphne so rarely see her in person, but I heard she was getting worse from our parents. In early November, Daphne had a mental breakdown. She trashed Liam’s room completely and vandalised Jim’s car in a fit of rage. This was enough to finally get her moved up the waiting list for mental health services and she started therapy. She reached out to me during this time and we had a few conversations and I invited her and Jim to visit my husband and I for a vacation at our beach house in March.Then we saw Daphne and Jim over Christmas and it was awful. Daphne could keep herself in check for a couple of hours, but then she would revert back to her old self. She would swear constantly, and while I know Liam can’t understand her, I think swearing at kids isn’t okay. Whenever I expressed concern for her she would just snap that I need to get off my high horse about having a “perfect” child. Jim was snapping at her constantly. He would also constantly ask to hold or play with my child, to the point it got annoying. Overall, the whole Christmas break was just the whole family being anxious over the situation.My husband finally said a week ago that he didn’t want Daphne and Jim visiting, and I agreed. I called Daphne and said that something had come up with my husband’s work and we needed to cancel the trip. Daphne was furious. Apparently her therapist had been saying how good this break would be for her (they haven’t been on vacation since having Liam) and I owed her this one thing to help her. Eventually she gave up and said I was a horrible person for pulling the rug out from under her and hung up.I feel bad if I’m derailing her recovery, and even my parents think I shouldn’t have cancelled, which is making me rethink things. They saw how absolutely horrible she was to me over Christmas, they saw how obsessed Jim became with my child, and they still think I should have put that aside, and they’re not normally the “keep the peace” people, so maybe I really am in the wrong.

They also have La Brea, which is a mom and I show. Plus I have engaged in some of my guilty pleasures. [Trolls movie series]. That said, since FNAF holds a special place in my heart, the PFP I set for myself is Freddy Fazbear himself.Either way, this is not about that. You might be wondering why my Aunt has my Peacock Account. The answer is my Uncle.My Dad, my Dad's Fiance [Maria], and I went to go visit my Grandparents, and turns out my Uncle Jerry was visiting from out of state. We visited on football night, so my grandfather, my dad, and Uncle Jerry were trying to watch the game. Bad news: whatever my Grandpa uses to get his channels on his TV failed.Uncle Jerry said we could use Peacock to watch it, but since they don't have an account they'd need to pay for it. This is where I came in. I signed in on his ipad and they watched it a bit on there, but then they wanted to scale up so I signed in on my Grandparents' Firestick. Simple as that. They enjoyed the game and then soon we left for home.A few days pass and I don't hear anything, but then I get a text from my Aunt Melinda [Jerry's Wife] saying \"You need to change the picture on your peacock account. It's too scary for me and the kids.\"Uncle Jerry has two sons, and they're 10 and 7 respectively. They're also very much of the Christian Faith, so I bring that up because their household is not conducive to horror. However, Freddy holds a dear place in my heart for many reasons that I won't outline here.I told Aunt Melinda that I didn't want to and she said that I still need to. I then told her \"If you don't want to see Freddy every time you open Peacock, get your own account.\" and stopped responding. Aunt Melinda isn't a particularly vindictive person, so I think that's why she didn't respond directly to me after that.Later on, I got a call from Dad asking what happened, and I had to explain. He wasn't mad per se, but wasn't exactly proud.Here's everyone's position:Aunt Melinda: Wants me to apologize and change my profile pic.Uncle Jerry: Says I should consider doing it for Aunt Melinda and the boys.Dad: Says that I have a point and that it's my prerogative, but says there will be an impact.Maria: Says that since I'm the one paying for the account, I have the final say.Mom: Told me I wasn't in the wrong at all and I should change my password and sign out of all devices that aren't mine.I am mentally at a stalemate personally.

This is a trip I've been planning for a couple years and is somewhat of a splurge for me.I have 6 children (31M, 30M, 19F, 16M, 9F, 7M). My oldest son is paying for himself and his 2 sons (7M, 5M), and I'm paying the costs for everyone else including my 30 y/o's fiancé and my 16 y/o sons’ best friend.My girlfriend is also coming with us and I'm paying for her and her 5 y/o daughter.My 19 y/o daughter asked me if her boyfriend (of 15 months) could come with us on vacation. My answer was yes but that he would have to pay the extra costs (flights, excursions, etc). We're renting a house and my daughter would be getting her own room anyway so he could stay in there for no extra cost.According to her, the only reason her boyfriend isn't coming is because he can't \"afford\" it. This essentially translates to his parents have refused to pay for it. I know his parents are wealthy and in fact are currently on vacation. My daughter is not with them and from what I know was not invited.My daughter has been begging me to just pay for him so he can come. My answer has remained no, and we have argued quite a lot about it.One of her biggest objections is that I am paying for multiple other non-family members and that her older brother (30M) is old enough to be paying for himself. She has not agreed with my defences.When it comes to my 30 y/o and his fiancé, they would have chosen not to come if I was not covering the bigger expenses for them. They are paying for a wedding in May and don't have money for a trip like this right now. I love them both and wanted them to come which is why I'm happy to pay for them.My 16 y/o has been best friends with the kid that's coming with us since 1st grade. He's been raised by a single mom, dad's not in the picture and money's always been tight for them. He's never been on a proper vacation, and he spends so much time at my house he is practically family.My daughter's biggest issue is my paying for my girlfriend and her daughter, which she then escalated to be about any of the money I've spent of my gf. I told her it was none of her business how I spend money on my partner or how we split expenses. I earn 3x as much as my gf why would I expect her to split costs evenly.My daughter is upset with me right now and I feel bad but don't really think I'm being an asshole. My gf thinks I was being an asshole during an argument with my daughter because I pointed out the people I'm paying for are the people I want to be there, obviously making her think I just don't want her bf there, even though I have a neutral stance on it. My gf thinks I should cut my losses and just pay for the bf. I think she's just saying this because she feels bad my daughter turned it into an issue about her. Am I being the asshole?",

However he likes to tell people he did it without any help and saved up all by himself. This it’s technically true, he did save the money by himself, but he also got help in that his parents let him live at home rent free and food free for years so he could save. He was able to save £30k in 2 years because of this!He was having some friends round (not a housewarming) and bragging about how he saved up all by himself and ‘didn’t just get a handout like some people’ whilst also looking at me. I was really shocked by this as, due to the housing market right now, everyone I know has had some help from family in order to buy homes, even those in couples.I basically said back what I said in the title and pointed out he lived at home rent free for years, so he did get help from his parents.

He bought himself a newer car because he didn’t like the family one he was able to use.He bought at the end of November, housewarming was in December. This was not the first time he had made comments like that but the first time he had intentionally looked at me whilst making them.Edit: SpellingAfter university I house shared and rented for 5 years, I saved some money but nowhere near enough to buy because of the cost of renting. I said in comments and will say again I wouldn’t have my home if not for my grandma because of the housing situation in the UK right now.And to the person who said I let my grandmother die so I could have her money.

	"body" : "Me (29F) and my husband (31M) have a son (3M) and a baby girl on the way.As a baby, my son developed a severe allergy to diapers. He'd get awful rashes that took way too long to get better, and nothing we did helped much. Due to that, my husband and I decided to start potty training a bit early (right before he was 18 months old). We talked to his pediatrician and relied on cloth diapers as much as we could. After a few months of that, he'd almost grown out of his allergy, but we kept going.Today, he's fully potty trained. He has some (very) rare accidents, but only when he tries to delay his bathroom trips for too long. When that happens, we wash him up and replace his underwear.My husband's mother was firmly against our decision to potty train our son early. She insisted that it would lead to IBS, and that he should wear diapers until he was at least three. She tried to convince us to change our minds for months, but we held our ground.In early December, I had a doctor's appointment while my husband was at work, so I left our son with my MIL for a couple hours. Some time later, she called me and said my son had a (bathroom) accident. He hadn't had one in months. I instructed her on how to proceed, as well as where to find the spare clothes I'd packed for him.I picked him up about an hour later. On our way home, he complained about being \"itchy\". I didn't know why until I got him ready for bathtime later that night. He was wearing a diaper.He didn't get any rashes, but the diaper was a couple sizes too small and he hadn't worn one in a long time, so I think that's where the itchiness came from. When I asked him about it, he confirmed my MIL had said he was \"still a baby\" and put him in the diaper.When my husband and I confronted her about it, she defended herself by saying his accident was clear proof we'd made a mistake by potty training him early, and he should go back to wearing diapers for the time being. At no point did she apologize.We decided she was forbidden from babysitting, as well as spending time with our son unsupervised. She didn't think we were serious until we went to her place on Saturday. We had to go to the hospital, and rather than leaving our son with her, we took him with us.Now that she knows we're serious, she's calling us dramatic and ungrateful, as well as claiming we're alienating her from her grandchildren out of stubbornness. She maintains she was right about early potty training being a bad idea, and was only trying to help us.I don't think we're in the wrong, but this does feel a bit dramatic. My BIL, who was skeptical of our decision back in the day, thinks we're right to be angry, but it's still an overreaction to revoke her permission to babysit our son.AITA?EDIT: I feel the need to point out the diaper was clean when I removed it.

Julie saw the Mirabel doll and asked my daughter if she could play with her. Amy refused. Julie protested, but I spoke with the girls and managed to get them to play with other toys.Some time later, the kids sat down to watch TV while me and the others got dinner ready. When we went back to the living room, Julie was gone. After a short search, we found her in my bathroom. She had taken not only the Mirabel doll, but also my nail polish carrying case.Julie had used my nail polish to paint the doll's hair, face and dress. It covered most of her facial painting, matted her hair and ruined her clothes. Amy saw what happened and was devastated. When we asked Julie what she was doing, she said she was giving the doll a makeover.Nat and Julie left in a hurry. The next day, I asked Nat what she planned to do about it, she suggested that the girls apologize to each other (Julie for painting the doll; Amy for not sharing it in the first place) and \"hug it out\", and offered to give me a couple new bottles of nail polish.I made it clear that Amy didn't need to apologize, and while I didn't care about the nail polish (they cost $4 and Julie didn't empty the bottles she used), I did expect Nat and her husband to replace the doll.Nat refused. She said that it wouldn't be fair for her to waste money over an \"innocent mistake\" a child had made. She also doesn't think Julie should be the only one apologizing, as none of this would have happened if Amy had agreed to share in the first place.I asked her twice, she said no both times. Finally, I called her husband and explained the situation. He apologized profusely and agreed to buy Amy a new doll. He stopped by on Saturday and gave it to us. He also brought Julie along and made her apologize to Amy.Apparently, Nat and her husband fought over this, as she kept insisting that Julie was just a child and they owed us nothing. So now, in addition to saying it was entitled of me to expect a new doll, she is blaming me for their fight.My husband is on my side, but my MIL thinks I should apologize, as this has blown out of proportion and I could have dealt with it more gracefully. She also thinks it was wrong of Amy to refuse to share.AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for not depositing my Christmas check?",
	"body" : "For Christmas I (29F) received a very generous check from my parents. I wasn't expecting it and they never spend this much on gifts so it took me by surprise. Not to give exact numbers but it was four digits. I was very grateful and thanked them for there generous gift.Everything was great......until the day after Christmas. My dad would come up to me multiple times and asked if I deposited the check. I told him that I would and that I could deposit it through by banking app. Well the day goes on and I forget to deposit the check.The 27th comes along and I get home from work and my dad gets on me again and asks if I deposited the check. I told him no and he seemed annoyed and again told me to deposit the check. Well as you can probably guess the day ends with me again forgetting to deposit the check.Now it's today (the 28th) and my mom texts me while I'm at work asking if I deposited the check. I told her no and she must have told dad because he started angrily texting me.\"I asked you to do something and you didn't do it. I'm so upset with you OP it's not even funny. This is a total disrespect of me and your mom. I asked you to deposit the that check and you didn't. You know we did this because we love you and you turn around and not deposit the check like I asked. I'm so upset. Just give me the check and I'll deposit it in your account if you're that lazy. Ungrateful\"I was shocked when I read that while at work. And I'm not going to lie, it hurt a lot. I spent most of my lunch break in tears trying to think of a response. I love my dad a lot but I felt like his anger was out of line and needlessly malicious. Unfortunately, while my dad is loving most of the time he does have bouts of anger like this (like once a year not often at all). He never gets physical or anything but is very loud.Eventually I texted him back saying: \"Hi dad, I'm sorry that this has made you upset. It's not that I'm ungrateful. I guess I just don't understand why this needs to be deposited right away. Especially since it hasn't even been a week since I received your very generous gift. I love you very much and I don't want this to damage our relationship. So I think it's no longer appropriate for me to accept this check. I'll give you the check back when I get home.\"I thought that was the best and most mature way to reply. Maybe he'll calm down?..........No.He replied back with this: \"OP when I tell you to do something I want it done. When your mom asks you to do something you do it. Now I want you to deposit that check today or I will disconnect your internet (we live in the same house). I ask for the simplest thing and you cant give that to me. I have my reasons for wanting the check cashed. You should honor my wish. As far as I'm concerned, this has damaged our relationship.\"I've since deposited the check like he asked, but I'm really confused am I really in the wrong here or is he blowing this out of proportion?",

I am on the border of my 1st/2nd trimester right now.Currently in laws are visiting husband and I in our country.I got hospitalised twice with a threatened miscarriage and while baby and I are thankfully okay, I’ve been put on bedrest.MIL offered to stay with us until Feb when we would’ve travelled to their home for the wedding anyway.She will still be there for most of a month before the wedding, she just won’t be available to do running around errands in JanuarySo to be clear my MIL is absolutely not going to be missing the wedding OR the last last minute stuff OR the bridal shower etc. IN ANY WAYI haven’t said yes either way but I guess she told SIL because she reached out and was like obviously I want mum at home but if you’re not well then I’m happy for her to stay with you guys and I’ll just figure out the rest of the wedding planning myself.I guess her fiancé doesn’t agree. He’s been texting me saying that I’m being over dramatic and I’m too young to need bed rest and I’m sabotaging their wedding because I can’t be bothered to look after the child I already have and that I don’t need accommodation for the one in me.I feel bad because my MIL has been the driving force in organising the wedding and like I guess I could just figure things out and deal with the consequences.I don’t want to be the reason my SIL’s wedding ends up slapdash or indeed keep her parents away from her in her last month as a singleton.AITA?Edit: the start of an update in the comments",

	"body" : "Not in the USMy husband Nate and I (both 50) have been married 24 years with twin sons (22). He got into an awful car accident a couple months ago and though was not seriously injured he was shaken. He now often talks about how life is fleeting and we should make sure to be prepared.Nate has 2 siblings, an older brother and a sister Tina (33). Tina is actually Nate’s biological daughter. He had her in high school and his parents adopted her from birth. Her mom was never in the picture. The family all knows about this including Tina herself. Tina and my family were cordial but not close.Nate’s parents passed within a year of each other almost a decade ago. They split all they had 3 ways for their 3 “kids.”Five years ago Nate’s older brother decided to join a monastery. He left behind all of his worldly possessions to Tina and my sons though my sons mostly got things of sentimental value while Tina got things of more monetary value.I think my in laws were all within their rights to handle their money as they saw fit. My problem is Nate.Yesterday Nate told me he had a rough idea of how he would like his possessions taken care of. Basically he would like to split all he has 3 ways: Tina and our 2 sons. We don’t have a lot but Nate has his parents’ inheritance and he would like to give that to all his children equally.I asked him how was this fair? Tina was adopted by his parents and already received her inheritance as their daughter. If his parents gave him and his brother half and half, I would understand why he felt the need to provide Tina with something.As it is, Tina already took from his share of the inheritance. Moreover his brother also gave her money and valuables worth more than our sons received. Tina is also a dentist. She is in no way in need of financial help.Nate said at the end of the day Tina is his biological daughter and it is only right that he left her something. I don’t think we need to pile more money onto a capable woman with a good job who already has so much while our sons are still young and just starting their careers. AITA?",

Before Covid-19 happened we hadn't seen each other for at least two years and covid happened so it's been five years since we all saw each other. A lot has changed, many of us have graduated and have full-time jobs, many have gone on to start a PhD and so on.My sister works at a high school as an English teacher whereas I work at a university as a university research lecturer. My sister spends 80% of her working hours teaching, the other 20% of the time is spent marking and doing admin. During dinner, a friend of hers asked me what I was up to now; before I got the chance to answer, my sister butted in, saying she's got the same job as me; she teaches. At this point, I said no, we don't have the same job. I corrected the fact she works as a teacher at a secondary school. I work at a university, and I only spend ten hours a week teaching; the rest is spent researching my field of work, coming up with new project proposals, publishing and much more.I do admit that I have an attitude problem but I don't know why. Most of the time anything I say comes out in a rude tone even though I don't mean to. I immediately apologised for giving a rude attitude as it genuinely wasn't meant to happen. However, I didn't apologise for correcting my sister. We had dinner and went home, I noticed my sister was in a mood whilst dropping her off back to her place.This morning I woke up to a message from my sister, which was a paragraph calling me an asshole for looking down upon her job and being downright rude. I sent a message back saying \"I knew my attitude came off rude, but I apologised for it straight away when I noticed. I said I don't look down upon you because you're a teacher. I won't apologise for correcting you and saying our jobs are different. You are a teacher, and most of your hours are spent teaching; the rest is spent marking and doing admin tasks.

During gatherings of friends or family I somehow always ended up in the kids room, helping the birthday boy and his friends assemble the new Playmobil fortress (because he asked me for help) or something like that. While the other adults eat cake around a table. Nothing wrong with them. I just always wonder how I got myself sitting on the floor surrounded by tiny humans.But lately my health took a nosedive. Burnout and other stuff. I'm no longer good with noise and crowds or focus. I'm on disability because I can't work. My family knows this.When my niece had her birthday I was invited but I had a really, really bad day. I knew their apartment would be too crowded and noisy for me during the party, so I told my brother I had to cancel and come the day after. Discussing the reason, my brother convinced me to still come over for a little while, eat some cake and hug the birthday girl \"to show up and not disappoint her\". I made my limitations clear, that I can't help and that I might zone out. He said it'd be no problem.When I came over, I sang happy birthday with them all, gave my niece her birthday hug and gift and sat myself in the living room with them, eating cake. The kids were playing, I didn't know the guest parents, it was as overwhelming as I suspected, so I stuck to my piece of cake and zoned out a little.I don't know how much time had past, but the next thing I knew was that there was a scream from my niece and when I looked up, there were no more adults around, my niece had fallen down from a bar stool she had climbed and had a bloody knee (nothing more serious, luckly). When I got to her the other adults rushed in from the balcony a room over. My niece got checked over, got a bandaid and was already playing again 5 min after. But my brother asked me what happend and why I didn't prevent her from climbing. And when I told him I zoned out, he got angry and blamed me for her accident.It's a few days later now and I got several messages and calls from family, how irresponsible and asshole-y I am because I was not paying attention to the kids. I thought it wasn't my fault, because I wasn't made aware that I was the only adult left in the room. But I'm beginning to doubt my point of view. Am I the asshole here?",

	"body" : "Hi, I (30F) am pregnant and due in April. My husband (35M) and I have a baby shower planned next month to celebrate with friends and relatives.  This event is very important and meaningful to me as I have not publicly shared the news with my friends and family on any social platform (i.e. Instagram, FB, the usual). My husband is super excited to invite all his friends from work and other social circles to the baby shower, most of whom I generally like and get along with--except for one. Let's call her Sharon. Sharon is my husband's former coworker and she is also pregnant (a few months after me).I never saw Sharon as a real problem up until last week, where my husband and I attended another good friend's baby shower (where Sharon was also invited).  Prior to attending the event, my husband told me to make sure to wear a jacket and keep my baby bump as discreet as possible, so that I don't steal the spotlight from my friend, which I completely agree and respect.I was shocked  when Sharon showed up wearing the tightest maternity bodycon dress one could ever imagine. Her baby bump was extremely prominent and shown in such a way where it essentially forcees the conversation on her pregnancy. This was almost everyone's FIRST TIME seeing her baby bump; some people didn't even know she was pregnant! It was incredibly uncomfortable for me as I watched the energy shift from my friend to Sharon. People were more interested in Sharon's baby, asking the usual 20 questions people are keen to ask when they find out someone is expecting. And the worst part is, Sharon seemed to bask in the spotlight and gleefully answered everyone's questions.After witnessing that debacle, I no longer wanted Sharon at my baby shower. Her selfish behavior and attitude made it clear to me that she would try and pull the same exact shit at my baby shower. My husband tells me that not inviting her to my baby shower will cause unnecessary drama, since she is friends with the people who are attending. He also told me that we won't be invited to Sharon's baby shower and that it will start even more drama, etc, etc... I do care about my husband and the connection he has to his friends, but at the same time, I am hurt that he is not taking my side and understanding why I feel so strongly about this. It just infuriates me that he won't even acknowledge that what Sharon did is wrong and in poor taste---in fact, he is making me feel like I am being overly sensitive and that I am overthinking everything!I have no one to turn to and I feel that the only course of action for me is to take this girl off the invite list. I am too stressed to think about the consequences this may have on the social group, nor do I have the bandwith to truly sympathize. I just want to be selfish and thiink about my baby. AITA?",

My wife doesn’t have as much of a problem with her living at home as I do, but the main thing that annoys me is that Katie spends her money on stupid things that she doesn’t need instead of saving up for her own place. We’ve given her so much and she basically just throws it back in our faces.Jesse is starting to walk around furniture and is getting more adventurous, so Katie bought corner protectors and cabinet locks to put around the house as well as baby gates. She came to me and asked me if I could help her put them on stuff and put up the gates, but I told her that I didn’t want to start putting all of that around my house. She said we need them up to keep Jesse from hurting himself, but I reminded her that Jesse has a whole nursery that he can learn to walk in, so he doesn’t need to be walking around the kitchen or living room or any other room, and it’s her responsibility to make sure he doesn’t injure himself. We got into an argument about it and I basically told her she should he saving her money to get her own place where she can do whatever she wants instead of buying more things to put in my house.She got pretty upset but I think she got the message because she hasn’t talked about putting them up since. My wife asked me why I wouldn’t help her out and I told her that if we start childproofing our house, it will give Katie the impression that we’re willing to accommodate her and Jesse for as long as she wants and that she can live with us for god knows how long.

My wife reassured me there’s no romantic/sexual things but she feels guilty for the friend because my wife was in a similar situation in the past. The situation reads as very codependent to me and I tried to explain to my wife the best that I could that this codependency is impacting me and our marriage. That it’s okay she wants to support her friend but that needs boundaries, parameters, and I need to feel like I can say no. And that if she wants to continue her friendship with Bertha, she will be doing it somewhere other than my house. I made it clear I don’t like her, I don’t like how my wife treats me around her, and if she wants to continue she needs to do so elsewhere.And as for the tension around me paying for everything, I let her know that it would make me less stressed if she did find a job. That if she can’t understand wanting to come home and unwind then maybe she needs to see how hard work is. Because I need that empathy as bare minimum from a partner.

To those who claim I have a problem with being black, lack empathy, etc, none of those things are true. And no, she had never met my family members until that night, and she had never seen any pictures of them. I have a flip phone and have never used social media, and neither have my relatives, so there aren't really any photos to go around. Even if my friend had asked to see a photo of my family, I'd have literally nothing to show her.As expected, my family and my friend are aware of this post. They want it to be taken down and feel it's a massive violation of trust that I've made a few posts of them here. Nonetheless, they're only listening to the very few comments siding with them. Ultimately, my friend has decided to go NC with me because she feels she doesn't know anything about me despite sharing a lot about herself. I feel you can't really please everybody, and even if you're a kind person who does everything right, you'll always have somebody who takes issue with you for whatever random reason. I wish her luck in her future endeavors.Edit 4: I'll be heading out now to catch up on a series I read. Thank you everybody for your judgements, aside from the weirdo who said I should call everybody the N word. I'm not sure why that pointless comment is still there.Edit 3: My family has asked me to take down this post, and they say they're upset that I didn't tell them I have autism. However, I'm getting very insightful responses so I'll be keeping this post up. I do agree with the vast majority of comments that I'm not particularly obligated to tell anybody anything about me no matter how close I feel to them. However, it's not something I do on purpose. I just don't think to tell people things sometimes.Edit 2: Thank you everybody for your responses. Somebody asked if I have autism. I do, but it's not something I particularly advertise. If my family asked if I had autism, I'd say yes. If my friend asked if I was black, I'd say yes. I can understand her being surprised about my background since I have absolutely no black features despite my DNA test saying I'm about 40% African with the rest being white and a smidge of indigenous.Edit: My brother found this somehow and had this to say: \"It doesn't matter how AITA feels. They don't know you like we do. You have a big problem with communication and if everybody in the real world thinks you're in the wrong, it's because you are. Reddit isn't real life.\"I (25M) am biracial but pass for white. I have pale skin, B1 dirty blond hair, and overall, don't look black at all. I've never spoken about being biracial because it never occurred to me that I need to. It's not something I ever think about.However, in the 9th grade, I made a black friend.

She was back in town, so I invited her over to catch up. She got along great with my family, but also took me aside and tell me she didn't \"see that coming.\" I asked her what she meant, and she said she didn't know I was black. I told her I didn't really think to tell her in advance that I'm black, and she said, \"I mean, it's kind of a weird thing to not tell your best friend.\" I told her that I just don't tell people a lot of things in general, and she said she'd like if I opened up about myself more and that I could trust her. I said, once again, that I just didn't think to tell anybody. She said goodbye to all of us, and I asked my family who was in the wrong. They all sided with her, and said that if I consider her my best friend, I need to tell her these things.AITA? I'm an INTJ so I tend to not really talk about myself. I'm not ashamed to be black; I just don't see the point in talking about my genetics to random people.",

She is literally begging me every time I move slightly or readjust to let her knit a row. If you don't know much about knitting then you know that different people have different knitting tensions and I knit very tight, someone coming in and knitting a row looser would destroy the 18 hours work I've put into this piece as I'd have to unpick and loosen the previous row.Anyways, I nipped to the loo the first time and I come back and my stuff isn't how I left it, she admits that she was going to knit more but the lady opposing us (we were on a table of 4) told her not to, and when I got my work I realised that she'd moved the stitches and they weren't in the correct order. I fixed this and carried on. I went to nip to the loo again and got to the end of the carriage and saw her reaching for my knitting stuff so I took it with me, and did so every time I went to the loo after that.She kept getting in my space and critiquing me and not leaving me alone. I ended up snapping \"If you wanted to knit you should have brought your own knitting and not be trying to do mine. F off\". She started crying and moved seats. I may have been harsh but this was 3 hours or her being over my shoulder and touching my stuff after being told no. AITA?EDIT Thank you for all the kind responses, people were asking, why didn't I move earlier? The train was full. How often do I need to go to the loo? I went to the loo 4 times, I currently have an eye condition where I need to put in drops every hour and they leave an awful taste in my mouth so I end up drinking a lot of water, I went through my 2L bottle of water on the train.",

I’m not talking about swearing at him; I’m talking about dropping f-bombs in general.Tonight I asked my husband what time he is coming to bed. He likes to stay up late and play video games on Friday nights and the weekend; whereas I don’t have that option because I have to get up with our son at 7 or 8 am. Before you ask, no, he has never woken up to take care of our son in the morning. Not once. I’m a stay at home mom, and he feels it’s my job to do that. So I haven’t slept longer than my 2.5 year old in 2.5 years.So I asked him what time he’s coming to bed, and he said “I dunno, 3am? 4am? 5am?”And without stopping to think about it, I said “oh fuck you”...I meant it as a joke. I knew he was kidding about staying up that late (the latest he stays up is maybe 2:30 am?) I meant it like “oh you think you’re so funny, hahaha fuck you, you’re hilarious”.

Ben and I work. Tom's been a sahd since 11m was 2. He went back to school 4 years ago. Ben and I cover all household expenses including any costs for Toms education.Background: Tom and I met at a party when we were 19. We've been friends ever since. With benefits at times we were both single. While on a holiday together a condom broke on us. Due to location emergency contraception wasn't available and when I turned out to be pregnant we chose to keep that kid and moved in together. We were never a couple but worked great as a family so we decided to have a second kid.Anna was my childhood best friend. She and Ben moved into the flat downstairs from ours when she was pregnant with 10f. I loved having her close again after living in different cities for years. Sadly she passed away after a very complicated second labour. Ben and I found solace in each other and I ended up pregnant. I didn't notice right away as my method of contraception should have been safe and I also blamed a lot of the symptoms on grief and guilt so when I found out there wasn't really an alternative anymore. Tom was the first one I told. He said he'd welcome another child into our family. Ben was shocked and really struggled to accept it but we kept in good contact through all of it.We all started having dinner most nights after 7f was born (10f and 8f would already spend the day as Tom was their \"nanny\"). Couple of years later my grandma moved onto retirement home and Tom and I decided to move to her house. Ben asked if he could move in with us and we agreed. It's maybe unusual but works for us.Where I might be the AH: Tom been with \"Bea\" for the last 3 years. There was some talk about him asking her to move in about a year ago but he never did. Bea and I get along. Not best friends but I like spending time with her. Well...liked. She showed up unannounced 3 days ago and demanded to see Tom. He's currently on a skiing trip with Ben and the boys. I reminded her of that and then said I will tell him to contact her if there's an emergency. She then proceeds to tell me that she is pregnant with Tom's child (highly unlikely) and that she already talked to his parents and they will buy them a house next to theirs so that they can live there as a family. And that they will be taking the boys with them. That's when I told her to leave which after some yelling and insults she did.I've since been called multiple times by her, her best friend and Toms parents to try and get his contact but I'm still refusing to give it away. They've been calling me an AH among other names for not letting him know that 1) Bea is pregnant. 2) he doesn't need to be abused and exploited anymoreedit to addTom's had a vasectomy after 11mhe's very low contact with his parents as they disapprove of me and our overall living arrangements",

	"body" : "I (33F) was child free and wanted to stay that way for most of my life and all my friends are the same. My partner and I talked a lot about pros and cons of having kids and we both agreed I wouldn't abort if I ended up pregnant but we won't actively work on kids.However in the last year we wanted kids more and more. First we wanted to foster (adoption is nearly impossible in our country) but then we sorta ended up pregnant. I am due to give birth soon and my friends are being dicks about it. I told them off and called them cruel and they called me a selfish asshole.So, context, since I have been purposefully child free most of my life I am aware of the downsides of having kids. I personally think a lot of people are being unwise when they decide to have kids and less population is generally better but I never ever said it to someone's face especially when they were expecting. One cannot know what are peoples motives to have children or to not have children and I never judged. Whether you have offsprings or not is completely irrelevant to me to see you as a person. When I got pregnant I was delighted but scared, naturally. I am anxious person by nature and I always talked through my things with my friends who were always there for me. Until the topic centered around my pregnancy. For the past 7 months of pregnancy, every time I mentioned something bad relating to pregnancy (like having nausea, back pain, insomnia) my friends jokingly said \"well you got yourself into that shit, now suffer hahhaa\". First it was a joke but sometimes it gets really hard and considering we always whine about something (one of the friends the other day literally cried cuz she missed a beginning of a movie in cinema, and nobody said anything to her) I don't think me \"whining\" about discomfort of carrying a baby is too much.Lately, they even upped the game saying stuff like they won't come by our place when the baby is there (I mean where should I put the baby???) and saying stuff like \"nice knowing you\", \"ah now you won't be able to go to concert with us\" (even tho when the concert happens baby will be 7 months old and I have tickets and plan to go).One went so far to tell me they don't even wanna met my baby, and that's when I lost it and called them all cruel. This resulted in backlash, calling me selfish asshole because I decided to have kids and I shouldn't be imposing the kid on them.Thing is....I am not imposing anything. The kid will simply be there and I never ever mentioned anything about them babysitting or looking after or in any way shape or form being included in baby's life. Just think I am going through something life changing (whether it was my decision or not) and just don't want them to dump shit on me whenever I mention anything related to my pregnancy or baby. I dunno, they all made some bad decisions in their lives, we all did, and we all were there for each other and this feels like I am their personal landfill because of their own issues with natalism/antinatalism.Opinions?",

Although I know we are both not perfect I feel as though he will never take accountability for his actions. It’s been a problem in his family, his mom aunts and uncles are all the very same. Quick to fight and never admitting when they’re wrong, just try to hit below the belt if they feel like they are losing type people. So I know it’s not entirely his fault, it’s how he’s grown up and defended himself.Plenty of times in an argument he has told me this house (that we received as a gift from his family) isn’t mine and he can take me out whenever he wants. He’s told me all the money he makes is HIS own and I don’t do anything to earn money, he’s even said that I’ve stolen from him when I’ve been a stay at home mom for the last 9 years. That’s a decision we made together but he really pushed for.  He’s said the car is HIS and I can’t use it at all when it was also a gift from his family for us to transport our daughters around and he could get to work. He’s basically pulled this power trip on me before after an argument just to be petty multiple times. The last big argument was a couple nights ago (that’s a whole different story) but we haven’t made up just been cordial. He made me lunch today and I’ve been making him tea or whatever he needs without him asking basically just going along as normal just not talking very much. Today I had been talking to some clients over text messages, we sell land and houses that he has bought and flipped so they are all under his name. I was asking some basic questions and if he had the GPS of the location and he said “let me see the phone I’ll just talk to them myself” and I “said no because I wouldn’t want him to take away my commission and say I didn’t do anything to earn it” he got mad of course. He said it was a stupid thing to say and to not ask him for any more help and do it myself then.

I work 8hr shifts at home, while also homeschooling our 3 school aged kids (7yo twins, 5yo), nursing our 2 month old and doing all the cooking. We do NOT homeschool as a normal. Schools have been shut down for 5 or 6 weeks after finding lead in the drinking water. But given this, I'm doing far more than my husband is. Not that it's a competition but let's be real.Well, this past week has been extremely rough on me mentally. There was a child death in my family and another family member is hospitalized in ICU. I'm struggling to power through it while still working, homeschooling, nursing the baby and cooking by myself. My husband is the opposite though. He isn't even remotely affected by what's going on in my family right now (he didn't know the child and he's not close to my hospitalized family member). He checks in on me through text during the day but when he gets home, he doesn't mention it. Doesn't ask how I am. He grabs his plate of dinner and takes the baby to go hang out with him while I clean up (I know it could be argued that he should be helping clean but me and my children are clean freaks and enjoy cleaning so it's no issue).But the night before last he asked if I could send the kids to bed early (7pm) because he \"just wanted to relax\". I said no. The kids had been great all day and they weren't even bothering him so no. They won't be punished for zero reason. Then last night at like 6:50ish he goes \"so we are sending the kids to bed at 7, right?\" I said no, why would we? And he snapped. He said \"I just want to fucking relax without having anyone talk to me after busting my ass all day. I'm tired of working and getting zero down time.\" And storms out of the room. This absolutely pissed me off because I work full time and do everything in this house so I should be the one begging for a break. The kids are in bed by 8, meaning he has literally 2.5 hours to deal with them daily. But anyways, he comes back in and says \"sorry, can we please just send them to bed?\" I said no and walked away. He's pissed at me and says I'm not letting him catch a break \"once a week\".ETA: we have an agreement that neither of us make a decision regarding the kids without first speaking to each other. This was put in place after he repeatedly made new rules without informing me and would discipline the kids for not following the rules when I was the one allowing it because nothing was ever communicated to me. He also overstepped tremendously back some years ago. So we now have this agreement. And no, he doesn't want them to go to bed early to have time with me.

If you're grown enough to put a ring on your finger, you're grown enough to move out and support yourself.\"Leah wasn't happy to hear that and said they can move in together when they get married, and being engaged wouldn't really make any difference so why should she have to move out right away if they get engaged.& I told her that personally, I don't believe in marrying someone you've never lived with.

I first heard of this name when I was a kid and thought it was beautiful, and decided that if I ever had a daughter, I would name her Adelaide.After hearing this, one of my friends (27F), who I have been close with since we were at University, began acting distant towards us. Throughout my pregnancy I have tried to be sensitive to her feelings, as I knew it was a sore point for her. Two years ago, she tragically lost her baby girl to a stillbirth. I can’t even begin to imagine how heartbreaking this must have been for her and I made sure I supported her through this devastating loss. Despite her trauma, she has never been anything less than kind and empathetic towards me, up until that day. A couple of weeks later, she confronted us, suggesting we change the name of our baby, to which we rebuffed. She kept on trying to convince us, suggesting different names, or saying that Adelaide was too old-fashioned or that it wouldn’t suite our child. We kept on denying to change her name, until eventually my friend started crying and revealed that Adelaide was the name she’d chosen for her stillborn baby.When she was pregnant, she refused to tell anyone her baby’s name, as she wanted it to be a surprise for when she was born. After the stillbirth, she decided she would keep the name to herself because it was personal to her, to which we understood. Until recently, no one knew what her baby was going to be called. She claims that, by keeping our name, we are disrespecting the memory of her baby. She said that if I chose the same name then my daughter would be a living reminder of what could have been.

I love everything about that girl, outside of her shower usage.So.. she showers twice a day. Once before school and once around 5pm. She stays in there for 45 minutes to an hour and 15 minutes every single time. Our hot water is electric and her shower usage has raised our bill to nearly $600 a month for the past 4 months. Whenever I talk to her dad about it, I'm met with a \"it's something we have to get used to because I'm not going to tell her she can't shower\". She uses all the hot water, and considers she showers around dinner time and the kitchen sink affects the temperature of the shower, she's constantly screaming out of the bathroom to turn off the kitchen sink when I'm literally trying to cook and need the water to do so. I've told her several times to not use the shower during the hours of 4p-6p so I can cook/do dishes but she always claims to \"forget\" or gets extremely pissed off and causes a bunch of tension in the house because she \"feels gross\" and needs a shower right that minute. I'm starting to grow resentful because there have been several times I have attempted to bathe our daughter/bathe myself or do the dishes and there's been no hot water. My husband also takes two showers a day. Once before work and once immediately following work. He comes home at 6. He also complains because when he gets home there's no hot water but he never says anything to his daughter.But recently they cut my husband's hours down to half the time he usually had because the company is threatening to go under so the financial responsibilities have been 80% on my shoulders (I own my own business). It used to be 50/50. I told him that since I'm now paying significantly more than he is, I refuse to pay this much for electric and him and his daughter both will be limited to one shower a day, for no more than a half hour. I told his daughter this as well. Both are calling me controlling and have disregarded everything I said and still shower twice a day for 45+ minutes. So I left and told them to figure out how to pay for everything. I'm currently staying at my mom's with the baby. He says I'm an AH because I just left them in a trying time all because I want to \"control\" their showering. That's not it at all. They are financially ruining me and I'm not putting up with it anymore. I literally have maybe $200 a month after I pay all the bills and a baby that needs diapers. This is gross but I've literally only been able to shower twice without the baby since I had her because of them. I either bathe her or bathe myself thoroughly and I need to bathe the baby because she's super chunky and gets stuff trapped in the rolls and gets rashes.ETA: this wasn't a normal until recently. Step daughter moved in with us in September for school because her mom moved out of district and she wanted to stay in the same school. So this is all new to me.

I ask what’s wrong, and he starts going off about the chicken. I just said “well I’m fine, did you heat it up enough before eating it?”, and in return got a meek response of “no, I ate it cold from the saucepan”. I’m not gonna lie, I was a bit confused on why he was eating it from the saucepan and even more confused because I didn’t see him LEAVE this morning with the saucepan so I asked about a container, he said apparently all of our food containers have vanished from the cupboard and he hadn’t washed any others that night so he just left the leftovers on the bench overnight and took them to work today. I really didn’t mean to sound the way I did when I said it but I replied “why the FUCK would you do that, did you want food poisoning?” and he fired back angrily with “well last night when you asked you didn’t say anything about it”.YEAH well I thought it was common sense that leaving chicken out for over 12 hours (16 hours I believe by the time he actually eats lunch) and then eating it would lead to a bad situation but apparently not, so AITA for not warning him of the consequences of eating old, unrefrigerated chicken? Or is there circumstances where that’s okay and I should have warned him?",

	"body" : "I (30f) started college last year. During my second semester, I met Phoebe (19). We were taking 2 classes together and we clicked immediately. We have a lot of the same interests and she’s just such a kind and smart girl.Phoebe was diagnosed with cancer over the summer. She spent a few months in the hospital and now goes for outpatient chemo every couple weeks.On Thursday Phoebe called me and said her grandpa was supposed to drive her to chemo but he never showed up and asked if I could take her.After her chemo she fell asleep in the car. I decided to bring her to my apartment to let her rest because she is one of 6 kids at home and her house is loud, not a good place for recovering from chemo.When we got to my apartment I woke her up, brought her to the couch, and brought her some blankets. She was very appreciative of me letting her stay at my apartment.The thing is, my mom is staying with us and she was supposed to be sleeping on the couch. It totally slipped my mind when I brought Phoebe home.My mom got back and asked why Phoebe was here when she saw her sleeping on the couch. I explained the situation and she said it was rude of me to give up the couch without asking her.I called my husband, explained the situation, and he picked up an air mattress and extra blankets for my mom but she’s still mad that I gave away the couch for the night (I took Phoebe home Friday afternoon). My husband says he gets why I did it but he gets why she is upset.AITA for giving my friend the couch when my mom was staying with us?Edit: I was told to add this to the post but Phoebe’s family couldn’t care less that she’s sick. They didn’t visit her in the hospital, they don’t take her to appointments unless they’re not working, they don’t have plans, and they feel like going, and they don’t make her siblings let her rest. She asked her mom if she was taking her to get a procedure done and her mom told her they can’t put their lives on hold just because she’s sick again.This part wasn’t in the comment but she shares a room with her 13 year old sister and her sister constantly has friends over and they hang out in her room. Phoebe has come over so she could take a nap on the couch before because she can’t rest at home.",

The mom kept 'accidentally' kicking me the whole flight and made her son annoy me on Purpose so i might give up my seat.When i went to the toilet i thought it was finally over as she might have accepted it but when i came back she was in my seat and my jacket and my bag which i left there were thrown into the aisle.

It's not exactly my jam, but I am always happy to hear her talk about it. I was not aware early in our relationship, though, that by \"Korean music,\" she particularly meant one specific male pop star. His name is Kai.Since we began cohabiting last year, I've also come to learn that it's less of an interest and more of an obsession. She spends an inordinate amount of time looking at his pictures, following his fan communities, and listening to his music. If I'm being perfectly honest it's a pretty huge turn off for me personally, but people will like what they like I suppose.Last summer, my sister told us that she was getting married and we were super happy for her. We immediately RSVP'd for her wedding, which was on Friday, January 12th. However, in December, Shelly came up to me and told me that she couldn't attend my sister's wedding. When I asked why, she responded that she was going to be in South Korea around that time.I figured that Kai was having some sort of a performance or fan meet and greet, but it was even worse. Shelly wanted to attend a fan-held birthday party event. Apparently his birthday is January 14th, which is today's date in South Korea. I asked if she was out of her mind, seeing as (a) she doesn't speak Korean (other than some of the lyrics of his she memorized), (b) she doesn't have that much money and lives primarily off of what I make, and (c) she was going to prioritize some random pop star's birthday party over her fiance's sister's wedding.Shelly told me she was going and that was that. Before she left for the trip a few days ago (on my birthday, actually), she begged me to tell my sister that she couldn't go because she was sick. I really didn't want to talk about it and just told her \"OK.\"Well, yesterday was my sister's wedding. It was a lovely ceremony. My sister and her husband were confused as to why Shelly wasn't there, and I immediately fessed up that she was in South Korea for an event. My sister was a little upset, but I told her not to let it ruin the day for her.After the wedding my sister apparently emailed Shelly, telling her that she wish she would have been upfront because she could have saved some money on her food for the event, and then Shelly emailed me furious about my telling the truth.Was I wrong to tell her the truth or were my actions justified here?",

He doesn't really contact them and has advised to me to do the same. It isn't a surprise as he was raised by his aunt n uncle since his parents were both 17 at that time and his grandparents were either no more or leaved out of the country. His parents never tried to make any contact with him anyhow. They had a daughter after 6 years who they cherished and thought of as their only child. Even though they were invited they didn't show up.  But only his sister had shown up,not expected but she was actually very respectful,apologised on his families behalf and didn't make up a fuss about anything . Also his sister was not blind since birth, she had a terrible car accident due to which she lost her eyesight.Out of courtesy I still invited them to my wedding. I was so happy about his sister showing up, that I decided I wanted her to be my bridesmaid. Since she is blind and I also send special handwritten notes to my bridesmaids, I made her a tactile invitation card. I decided that as a activity that all of my bridesmaids would receive a card with a part of a painting in it, which I had gotten made by a professional painter of me and all my bridesmaids together. So when they would arrange and pin up against a softboard would look like a complete painting.I conducted this activity during my bachelors party. Also there were no expenses left at making my SIL feel like she was just as cherished and a part of the celebration as others. The part of the painting on her card was also tactile around the borders and read in braille \"You and Me\".After pinning all if them on the board my SIL went ahead to touch it and that's where everything went downhill.Apparently she expected everyone's card to be tactile to honour her and make her feel included. So when she went to feel them and couldn't feel the tactile marks and realised others had gotten a plain card threw a whole fit about it. She ruined my bachelors party and posted on her IG that I am a jerk and my wedding should be as empty as possible and that  her brother is a fool to marry me. This broke my heart but my fiance supported me and we went on with the wedding. At first I didn't know why she had a social media account in the first place but still decided to tell my friends , family and bridesmaids to follow her since she  requested and now I deeply regret it. I haven't said anything to her because now I know nothing I do will be able to fix my broken heart and that I count be bothered enough to care for her.( Edit : It really was a surprise and due to some complications with our planner we didn't have much time to plan and that's why only my SIL received a tactile card.

My brother even agreed to meet my girlfriend a couple of years ago and it seemed to go fine.I messaged him again and thanked him for the invitation, but said I wouldn’t come unless my girlfriend could too. Now my mom is telling me that I’m being totally unreasonable, and that it’s his wedding and I’m making it about myself by being demanding etc.I know it’s his wedding and he can invite who he likes, and I’m not trying to start a fight, but honestly I hate the idea of going to another family event where I’m expected to hide who I am to “keep the peace”.So, AITA?",

	"body" : "This is my (f35) brother's wife (f29). My brother (m31) and her have been together since highschool, they have been married for 9 years.They have four kids. A girl (5 years old), twin boys (4 years old) and another boy (3 years old). She's currently pregnant with their fifth kid.She got a degree from college, but she completely ditched her career when she got pregnant with their first baby. My brother took over the family business, so I guess they're well enough financially.Ever since she had her first child, she got into this \"annoying mother mindset\" in which she literally can't talk about anything else than her kids and how much she loves motherhood. She's always giving advice to anyone who is listening, always asking dumb questions that she already knows by now, just to keep the focus on her and her kids.I have two kids myself, so I was always understanding and tried to help her especially with her first child, since I already was a mom at the time. But ever since the twins she's turning more annoying every time we meet.She can go on and on for hours about her kids, her marriage, her house, basically just bragging about how perfect her life is. She seems to believe that she's in some sort of fairytale or something, she comes across as childish sometimes.Well, I got tired of it. She was in the middle of bragging about how easy it was for her to get pregnant again when I asked if she knew how insensitive she was sounding. She said that she just feels fortunate for her fertility. I let it go that time, but then she started talking about how much she enjoys motherhood and how she feels this was her call, she said that it's so easy and she can't imagine prioritising a career instead of her children.Well, I snapped at that. I told her that she should stop bragging about her perfect life like that, without a care if the other women near her have fertility issues or financial problems that don't allow them to just sit at home all day looking after the kids. She got defensive and said I'm just jealous because my marriage is a failure, so I can't be happy for her.I told her that she sounded like an entitled child (along with some other things) and she started crying. Now I'm the asshole because I can't be happy for my own niblings and their mother? I am seriously struggling to see how I'm wrong here, that's why I am asking hereETA; should've made this more clear, but she thinks that women who prioritise a career instead of her children are bad mothers. For an example she thinks that my marriage is failing because I work instead of staying home and focusing entirely on my children/ my husband.I'm going to add this here because way too many people are asking me to explain it: She believes that once a woman has children, her life should be devoted to her children and her husband because that's what she did. So if a woman (for whatever reason) chooses to go back to work after having children, then that automatically makes you a bad mother.In fact, our kids like to play together, we often have playdates for our kids. But when her kids come to my house she has to come as well since she doesn't trust that I'll take good care of her children. This is not only applied to me, but she has refused to send her oldest daughter to other kid's houses because their mothers have jobs.Basically, she thinks that to be a good mother and have a good marriage, you have to do what she did, if you don't do it like her then it's your fault if your marriage fails and you're a bad mom.Also, I am in the middle of divorcing my husband. She thinks it's because I don't stay home and I wasn't paying enough attention to my husband, but I'm divorcing my husband because he is a man child who doesn't do chores and even expected me to tie his shoes! My marriage is in fact failing (has failed, actually) but not because of the reasons that she claims.Another edit... I DON'T doubt that she is happy with her life, she does seem too content. I say this because some people seem to be thinking that she's lying and she's actually miserable, well from my perspective I don't think she feels that at all. I don't doubt that her life is perfect for her, but when she goes on and on about it and makes those dismissive comments about other mothers, that's annoying. Just thought that I'd give my insight on that since I saw a few comments about it.",

I do understand a lot of people (seemingly more widowed men from stories l've others have told me) find someone very quickly and often be remarried before a year even, so l'm trying not to be naive here. For my siblings and l it has been a little strange as for us as we are still processing the death of our mother but also the new fiance is only a few years older than me and my sister who are the eldest. we've tried our best to make an effort to be happy for him and be welcoming to her, all while processing our grief. My issue is that he so wrapped up with his new fiancé that he’s forgotten we are still grieving. To the point that on the 2 year anniversary of our mums death 3 of us got their wedding invite in the post while the others the day after. It hurt all of us that they didn’t think about this date in the days/week leading up to it, but I decided to leave it as I didn't want to taint their joy. He sent a message to my grandma (my mums mum) out of the blue after no contact since the funeral (I was with my grandma at the time) asking for their address so he could send them an invite the day after the anniversary, hence we were with my grandparents to support each other. Not asking how they were at this time/how they were coping with loss of their daughter/whether they’d be ok with an invite... just stating they were being invited and he needed their address. My dear grandma said she’d like to attend for our sake, though my grandad refused point blank and was too upset to talk further. A month later me and my sisters were added to the hen do WhatsApp group with all new fiancés friends all now chatting excitedly and planning the hen. For us that was another pang of heartache, as we are only in this position coz our mum (pretty recently) died. Here's where l'm wondering if AlTA... I sent my dad a message to say I'm happy for him but feel theyve not though about our grief and would've liked to be asked first before being added to a hen group. But most importantly remember certain dates, i.e. the anniversary, and not send wedding invites in the days/week before this time. He replied saying \"sorry l'm not being thoughtful enough.l'll make sure to check with you beforehand\". Not it might've been insensitive to send his kids wedding invites just before the anniversary. I said I don’t want him to run everything by me, just remember we’re grieving. Then he blamed the post and said that it wasn't their fault it arrived on the day. Now I think he's avoiding me.

When they were 4 their parents went through a very messy divorce and as a result I took them in for 3 years.I’m not going to go in to detail but my brother became a drunk and the mom didn’t want anything to do with them so that’s why I took them in.I met my husband through the school they go to because his daughter is in the same class.During the 3rd year my brother got married to his wife who has a daughter with terrible manners. She is 9 so she is old enough but she is kid who will throw a tantrum at events when it’s not about her. Eg she blew the candles on my nephews birthday and when he cried he got reprimanded. I took them out the next day so he could blow his candles.Keep in mind my brother still isn’t making an effort with his own kids. Towards the end of the year he demanded to have his kids back and because of how the Court arranged it he was able to keep custody.I however still attended everything because the boys want me too. I never bonded with his wife or daughter because SIL is rude and is very passive aggressive. I have made efforts by invited them to my house to bond but she ripped up my husbands daughter favorite doll and then SIL got mad at me for reprimanding her.My wedding my daughter is going to be the only one in wedding party as a flower girl and my nephews are the ring bearers. We have a no kids rule  so that means no step niece as I know that she will throw a tantrum at my ceremony.The main issue is that she wants to be part of my wedding as a flower girl. My answer is no because I want my daughter to feel special. And tbh she isn’t important enough to me to want her in my wedding.Her mother is demanding that her daughter be a flower girl or my nephews won’t be taking part. That I’m hurting a child feeling by excluding her. It’s not that I want to exclude her it’s just that I know she is going to throw a temper tantrum the moment she knows she’s not the center of attention because no matter what she does that.I told my brother that if this happens I will cut off all financial support I have given them which he said was not fair.Keep in mind I would be paying for a babysitter at the hotel and I have chosen a venue that’s close to a theme park so while the ceremony goes on she will be there and then my daughter and nephews will join them for the rest of the time and then go back to the hotel to go to bed and everything while the reception goes through. Because this is a destination wedding I will be paying for my parents and brothers room and a babysitter which I think is generous and way more fun than being in a wedding which can be stressful.My brother is telling me to sort it out with SIL. And my parents understand me but told me to let it go. My daughter wants to be the only flower girl but wants my nephews and they cried when they thought they couldn’t be apart of the wedding.Also I’m not going to cut of financially support because that will just affect my nephews more than anyoneBTW the financial support I give is paying for school bills such as extracurriculars, tutoring and the cloths and shoes and school supplies to my nephews.My brother has always wanted to be a girls dad so I think he just pays for general stuff but leave my nephews to fend for themselves.

My mom, stepdad, grandparents, cousins, neighbors etc. Usually our family dinners are 6 people roughly. I don’t have much family and very few I’m close to. This was almost 20 people.I didn’t think much of it and ordered dinner. Then the neighbor of my grandmother, whom I’ve only ever waved to, offered a toast to me for being so generous and taking everyone out to dinner.I looked at my mom who was beet red. Appetizers came out at this exact moment. I had assumed some version of a Dutch meal since so many people were there. I immediately said “I’m not paying for dinner”I quickly looked around. Everyone had drinks. They ordered a ton of appetizers and everyone had steaks. This places steaks all are 80-250 per person. Quick math said this was going to be a 4k dinner easy.I got up, threw a $100 on the table and left.My phone was blowing up, I turned it off and went to bed and left the next day without saying bye. I didn’t handle it well bet actually felt used. I also told my mother I would stop sender her monthly allowance going forward.I know I’m nta with the dinner but more concerned about my reaction.Update: so my mom has been begging me to call her. I figured I’d let it go and called her back. I apologized for storming out, and assumed she would apologize too and we could move forward.Nope. I was called selfish, greedy, disrespectful and mean. I asked how they could call me greedy and selfish after everything I’ve done for everyone. She said I didn’t do that much and could do more.To be clear I’ve bought her 2 cars now. Helped remodel a bathroom. Replaced their roof. New appliances and paid for 5-6 family vacations. This is on top of a legion of other things.I got so mad I went scorched earth and told her that nobody would be receiving any more help they weren’t appreciative of going forward.I called AT&T and canceled the 6 lines I was paying for everyone. Canceled the internet I was paying for. Changed passwords on or canceled all my streaming accounts.  Kicked their cars off aaa. Kicked her off my insurance (car). And canceled the credit card I’d given her.No more free rides.UPDATE 2: Since everyone has been asking here are the updates. Nothing major.So after I left my niece (who was not there so 3rd hand here) said everyone was in shock. They tried to cancel dinner but the apps and drinks had already come so they split a 700 bill and left.Mom’s been calling, I’m avoiding her calls now. Her voicemails are each meaner than the last so I just delete them now. I told her I wanted time for us all to calm down and I’ll talk to her next month.I was uninvited from a cousins wedding I barely know. They didn’t want “drama” but let it known that they would like the present. That convo could spark off a whole other aita thread.They were deciding where the family vacation will be this summer previously, that horse is dead now.I visited with my niece and she told me that there is zero remorse or understanding. It is basically an accepted consensus that I’m a greedy, mean, monster.So nothing juicy. I’ll update if anything major happens but I think this is status quo for quite awhile",

	"title" : "AITA for not inviting my boyfriend on a physically extensive vacation because I do not believe he is capable?",
	"body" : "EDIT: The water thing. He is physically able to drink water. He says it worsens his heartburn and that's why he needs to drink soda, chocolate milk, and flavored water. He also cannot eat.. normally?  I have only ever seen him eat: chicken fingers, plain cheeseburger (just bun + patty), mildly spiced Thai curry, pizza, Kraft Mac and cheese, and other packaged foods. He says he cannot eat vegetables. I have never seen him eat a vegetable with the exception of the ones in the Thai curry. This alone is almost reason for me to not want to go with him. They dont have a kids menu. There will be a chef making food and you dont get to make requests.I planned a physically extensive vacation (horseback riding through the mountains for 10 days) prior to getting into a relationship with a guy that has a bad knee and a bunch of GI issues, including being an extremely picky eater and unable to drink plain water.When I told him about the trip, he immediately asked if he could come and if there was space on the excursion. He was really really excited that something like that exists. He used to ride horses when he was a kid. When I pointed out that he will be on horseback for literally 10 days, hasn't even ridden a horse in 12+ years, will have to eat whatever food they provide, and sleep in a rough campsite on top of all these health issues, he said he would just bear it. I told him he should research the trip and maybe go ride a horse locally somewhere. He had no interest in that and instead went to boot barn and started buying cowboy clothing.His knee issues are significant. If something happened, he could really injure himself further and he is on State health insurance. It's not great care. He kept talking like he really could do this trip. He cannot even walk more than a mile or two and cannot go hiking. How could he possibly ride on horseback through the mountains for 10 days? I literally turn into his medical assistant for physical work and his GI issues. His lack of concern and inability to think realistically struck me.If I go even a year without riding a horse (even just 6 months..) then I am in serious pain after 2 hours of riding. This would be 10 whole days. Not to mention the GI issues. He has sporadic GI issues that cripple him for hours. So the thought of 10 days of me having to worry about him, likely have to help him out a lot, and the risk was real that he may not be able to even finish the trip at all had me really start to dread the trip. I ended up having to tell him that I really want to just do this trip solo, as I originally planned it. I am a professional rider and I want to get the most out of this trip.Hes mad at me and will not acknowledge his physical impairments...AITA?",

	"body" : "I travel a lot for work so I rarely see my family. I try and get back to see them a couple of times a year. When I do get to town I like to take everyone out for supper at a nice restaurant.Not a three star Michelin restaurant or anything like that. But still a pretty hefty price tag. The party would be myself, my parents, my sister, her husband, their two kids, my brother, his girlfriend, and their two kids. So 11 people all together.The bill is usually between $600 - $1,000. It is a lot of money but I like to treat them. I look forward to seeing my nieces and nephews without their faces buried on a screen. They love going out to a fancy restaurant.I don't know why but the whole thing irks my brother-in-law. I just found this out. He seems to think that I'm doing this to show off. I'm not. I have an uncle that helped me get started on my career that used to do this same thing when I was growing up. He went more extravagant as well. I remember one year he took our family, about 26 people to Disney World. That was thirty years ago but I imagine it wasn't cheap. He said it was our Christmas and birthday gift for the year. He lied because I still got a card with $50 in it twice that year.I had a good year and this holidays I took everyone to a fairly expensive Steak House.When the bill came my brother-in-law grabbed it and said he was paying this time. I said for him not to be crazy, I invited everyone out it was my treat. He insisted. I didn't want to cause a scene so I dropped it. When he looked at the bill he went a little white though. I had allowed all my nieces and nephews to bring along someone if they were dating. Three took me up on it so there were 14 of us. The bill was a little bit more than $2,000. Plus tip.Call it $2,500 when everything was said and done. He paid it.I went for coffee with my sister the next day. She didn't bring it up but I did. I said that I was not mad but a little upset that he had done what he did. She said she was mad because they didn't really have a spare $2,500 to waste. I was surprised at this so I asked her if she thought it was a waste for me to take everyone out. She apologized and said she was just angry that he blew a hole like that on their budget. I gave her $2,500. She looked like she was going to cry. I told her that I took everyone out because I am missing seeing them grow up. I miss seeing all the family stuff they get to do. I blow through town for a week and I just want good memories.My brother-in-law called me later that day and said I was an asshole for letting him pay and then going behind his back with my sister. I told him I wasn't going to tell anyone about the money and that I wasn't trying to hurt him. They could just keep it on the down low.I'm just wondering if I should have insisted on paying instead of letting him think he blew his family's grocery budget for a couple of months on one meal.",

Dena has two best friends, Shana and Samantha who live in different states.Last month Shana asked my wife if she wanted to run a half marathon in Vegas. When Dena brought up going to Vegas I said half-jokingly that I had never been to Vegas and she can't go twice before I had gone once. She asked if I meant it. I said yes. So she was like ok I guess we can work it out. Samantha and Dena's sister ended up going too.I later backed out not wanting to be third wheel to a girl's trip. A few days after I backed out my wife found out Samantha's husband Jim is going and asked if I still want to go. I excitedly agreed.A week later my wife asks me \"Hey you're ok with sharing a room with my sister right?\" I said \"No I'm not ok with sharing a room. Why would we share a room?\" She explained that we would share a room with her sister to help save her and us some money. Apparently Shana was going to share a room with Samantha and Jim. I said \"Every single person going on this trip makes six figures other than your sister. Why would we share a room to save money? Why doesn't Shana share a room with your sister? Why would we give up our privacy to save money?\" My wife was not having it and we faught over it but didn't resolve anything.The more I thought about it the more it upset me. We don't go on enough dates. We've never been away from our kids for more than one night. Why would she feel ok with removing any chance at intimacy during a 4 day trip away from the kids?A week later I asked her thoughts on our Vegas trip. She explained that we wouldn't be spending any time in our room together anyway. Her last girls trip they never spent any time in their rooms. They only used their rooms to crash. This is a girl's trip and Jim coming along meant I would have someone for me but it didn't change that this was a girl's trip. I argued that having our own room and privacy doesn't change the trip at all.  Not sharing a room wouldn't change the dynamics of the trip but it would at least create the opportunity for there to be intimacy between us and that that was important to me. Again she wasn't having any of it. During the argument my wife admitted that she had agreed to share a room before she had even asked me. She said someone had suggested it in their text thread and she replied \"I don't care\".We didn't talk for a couple days after that fight. When we warmed back up to each other she told me that she had told the group we wouldn't be sharing a room any longer.She thinks I am the AH because I forced my will on her. I think she is the AH because she agreed to share a room without consulting me, tried to sell me on why that was ok, and ignored the importance of intimacy in our relationship.AITA",

	"title" : "AITA for refusing to pay for the expensive boots my puppy ate?",
	"body" : "We (M & F, 50's) have a nine month old puppy. I've struggled to train him,  and hired a professional trainer to help us out.  Even so, he does puppy things like chewing anything he can find that looks interesting. He has lots of specific dog toys, but they're clearly not as well designed at all the human-owned things that are so much more desirable to his puppy brain.Over Xmas, my brother \"Ray\" (37) and his husband \"Kevin\" (50) wanted to stay with us.  I refused at first,  but finally agreesmd because accommodation is insanely expensive in the summer holidays.   Before I agreed, I gave them the full run-down on the puppy's behaviour. I told them they can't leave anything on the floor,  and the door to their bedroom has to be shut whenever they're not there. To make things easier,  I cleared out the top shelf of the cupboard for them and bought several boxes with lids that click into place.  When they arrived,  I reminded them again.  My point was demonstrated when the puppy came trotting out to greet them with a pair of safety goggles in his mouth.  I didn't even know I owned safety goggles and have no idea where they could have come from.  Maybe he convinced a passing tradie to throw them over the fence to him?Anyway,  Kevin bought a new pair of RM Williams boots. He left the box on the floor of the living room,  and the puppy devoured them. He's demanding I pay to replace them, because it was my dog that destroyed them.  I'm refusing, because I gave him fair warning and provided a secure place to store anything he didn't want chewed up.  They also insisted on staying here, claiming they couldn't afford accommodation,  but I pointed out that if Kevin can afford $650 for boots, he can afford a couple of nights in a local hotel. I think in in the right,  but my husband thinks I should pay.  He said I'd be upset if the dog ate my boots. I said the dog DID eat my boots (although mine weren't $650), and I changed my behaviour to avoid it from happening again.  Husband says it's not fair to expect people to remember, but I think that's a silly argument and said if be really thinks we should pay,  the money will come out of our joint account.  Now he's sitting in the living room with Kevin and they're both sulking. AITA?Edit for further context: This blew up a bit over night so I thought I'd add a bit more information.The puppy is crate trained and responds to his commands about 90% of the time.  The living room the boots were left in was upstairs. The puppy is not allowed up there,  and there is a gate at the bottom of the stairs that Kevin constantly left open, despite me reminding him to keep it closed AND putting a sign up that says 'SHUT THE GATE'.However. I do not like Kevin, and I put up with him for my brother's sake. When reflecting on everything,  I asked myself would I replace the boots if it was anyone else. And I might, BUT I don't know anyone else that would stay at my place that would be so....oblivious to the precautions needed to protect their belongings. My sister and her spouse and kids stayed earlier in the year,  and one of the kids left their skechers on the floor in the downstairs loungeroom. The dog ate them and I offered to replace those, but my sister refused because the kids (15, 17, 19) are old enough to take responsibility and had been warned not to leave things lying around.   And that was at the time before the trainer had been engaged and the puppy was just a ball of undirected destructive chaos energy.I also sent them a text before agreeing to allow them to stay that said 'Dudes, the risk is yours. If the dog eats your expwnsive toys, that's on you.  You have been warned.\"",

He didn't adopt me and then mom died. I vaguely remember a social worker talking to me at the time and maybe a judge but I'm kinda fuzzy. My dad's brother and sister in-law won guardianship over me. I do remember wanting to live with my uncle at the time. I also remember saying that to those who asked me.I do have one memory of my sister's dad that sticks out and it was not a happy one. But I don't remember a lot about living with him specifically though I remember my mom reasonably well. She had a lot of problems and I have no idea if those existed before my dad's death or if they were things that happened after.My half sister and I see each other once a month and that has been the schedule ever since custody was figured out. My half sister always wanted more but I was okay with seeing her once a month. Over the years she told me I should move in with her and her dad and I always said I was fine not doing that. She would ask me why I called my dad dad instead of calling her dad dad. I told her we had different dads and she would always say her dad claimed two daughters and that I was the other one. I would show her photos of my dad and she would get a little frustrated with me because he died when I was so young while I have memories of her dad.In the last year she has been more obsessed with me moving in with them. I'm 16 now and I'm happy where I am and I don't want to live with them. I have always told her I'm happy at home with my family and she will tell me she and he dad are my family. I lost my temper with her a couple of months ago when she mentioned it again to me. I just got so tired of hearing it. She got upset and asked for our visit to end early. Then last month we had our visit a week before Christmas and she came with this idea that I owe it to her to move in with them because I'm her big sister and I'm the one who chose not to stay with her and her dad. She said it means so much to her and all that and that if I want to be  a good big sister I would do it for her. I told her I don't owe her that. I don't owe us living in the same house. I told her that is not what I want or am willing to make happen. She got really mad and yelled at me. Then her dad called my uncle and raged over the phone about my saying that to my half sister and claiming I should have more tact.AITA?",

I bought one for myself about 6 months ago. I called her Reina and I have to admit I don't always go horse riding. I told my sister 22F she could ride whenever she wanted and she started taking lessons on her. My sister loved Reina. At one point she tried changing her name but I did not allow it. After a while she started calling her \"My horse\" and she would frequently invite friends to ride her. I would hear it from the stable owner. I didn't think much of it until recently.My sister came to me and said she wanted to move Reina to another stable. I asked her why and she said she wanted Reina in the same stable as her friends horse. I didn't like the idea but after all she is frequently riding on Reina and the other stable is also closer to home so I said sure. Then she said she had already arranged everything because she knew I'd say yes. I got annoyed but just let it slide. So last week I went to visit Reina and wanted to ride. Turns out my sister also wanted to do horse riding. I haven't been on Reina for 2 months or so while my sister rides like 3/4 times a week. I told my sister that I only have time that day and said she could rent a horse for that one lesson on my costs.She then told me that I should just get off of her horse and rent one for myself if I want to ride that bad. We got in an argument and she literally yelled at me for everything. She said that I am a bad sister that I don't care about her that I am a brat and I don't deserve anything. Now our relationship always has been bad and she has always had anger issues but this reaction really pissed me off. I told her that Reina was not her horse in any sense. I pay for all her expenses. I paid for the horse and my name is the name on Reina's passport. I told her that from now on she is not allowed to ride Reina and she can either buy herself a horse or rent one but she needs to stay away from mine. My sister kept yelling and said that I am stealing her horse and that Reina doesn't even know me. She said that I am the worst sister ever and told our parents. My parents think that I am right but that I am overreacting because my sister has always had anger issues. They are saying that my sister really loves horse riding and she loves Reina. I told them she should have thought about that before disrespecting me. So AITA?Update: I see a lot of people who actually think I ride her once in 2 months. That is not true. I used to visit her 1-3 times a week but those 2 months I have been very busy. The first month I was with her really really often to create a bond and Reina knows that I am her owner. When she saw me she was really happy and did not go to my sister but she came to me. So she definitely knows who her owner is. Besides get my ass off? I have explained this in so many comments. I have been busy with work and didn't even have enough time to sleep. I love my horse and I always try to visit her but in the last 2 months I did not have any time. My life has been full with work and study. I had to travel a lot for work as well to meet new clients or projects etc. I have been doing schoolwork on airplanes. I have been working my ass off to keep up with this life and I pay thousands of dollars for Reina to be taken care of. Reina is being exercised multiple times a week and is definitely taken care of in the best way possible.",

And I mean, that's fine when we're home since it's only us, but she wears them out sometimes.So I advised her to wear her more modest shirts and I told her we could buy some extra more \"mommy style\" shirts, not only because her normal shirts will get ruined if she continues to wear them (too stretched) but also because she's a grown up woman now and needs to dress more accordingly.She told me off, said she'll dress up however she wants and to stop trying to tell her what to do all the time. I told her I was trying to help her mature because she'll need it soon, she can't dress up like she's going to a party everyday, especially not now that she's about to be a mother.Well she told me to stop \"bitching\", said it's hot and she wants to wear the clothes she likes, not dressing like an old lady. I asked her if she thought this was a game? Because she doesn't seem to maturing at all, she told me that I'm always telling her what to do and she's sick of it, so I told her that if she's sick she could easily leave and be responsible for her actions.Well, we're both angry now.

My parents emigrated in the 80s, but they made a point of traveling home several times per year and maintaining a Jamaican household to keep my siblings and I connected to our culture.I returned from this year’s vacation this past weekend, and I was telling Coworker A about it during our break because they asked what I was eating (a very popular dish there). Coworker B overheard that I was talking about Jamaica, and started gushing about going there over Christmas and how “immersed” in the culture she felt.I asked her where she stayed and what she did, and she said that she stayed in a Sandals resort and never really left except when she went to swim with dolphins and sail on a catamaran. I asked her whether she went to Kingston (where I was) and she said that she didn’t because it was just “too unsafe.” I then asked her if she enjoyed the food and she said that she didn’t have any of the Jamaican dishes “because she didn’t know what they were.” I didn’t say anything, and just kept a smile plastered on my face, told her that I’m “glad she enjoyed the resort”, and went back to eating my lunch and talking to Coworker A.Coworker B then questioned why I wasn’t engaging with her because “she’s been to the country” and I pointed out that she didn’t interact with locals, eat the food, or leave the Sandals except for tourist experiences so I didn’t feel like we could engage about much. She then got upset with me and accused me of “gatekeeping” my culture and ruining the memory of her vacation. I felt bad because Coworker A said that I didn’t have to ask her all those questions, but when I told my mom about it, her and my family were on my side. AITA?",

	"body" : "I'm looking for a second opinion. I have always been close with my son and daughter in law and think we have a really good relationship. They live just a mile down the road so we are together quite a bit. Babysitting has started to cause some friction though and I want to make sure that I'm being reasonable.My son and DIL have a 3 year old little boy that is as sweet as can be. My son works M-F and my DIL is a SAHM. I babysit my grandson 2 days during the week so my DIL can have a break and typically one evening/night on weekends for them to have a date night.My DIL has this rule that she wants to be there for any \"firsts\" that my grandson does. I get that though her definition of \"first\" is very broad. Not just like first trip to the zoo, but first time at a new park, first time seeing a new TV show, first time playing with a toy etc. I personally think the restrictions are a tad over the top, but her kid her rules and I have no problem respecting that.The issue happens in that she doesn't do any of these firsts. I'm really not sure what they do all day when they are home but everything I ask to take my grandson to do she says is a first, that she wants to be there for, but then she doesn't do it. It's made it so babysitting is alot of just sitting at my house with nothing to do and my grandson is bored.So the other day I told her that I think it would be a good idea for her to relax the first rule a bit so that I can take my grandson to do some things while I am babysitting. She did not like that and said that I was trying to take memories and special moments away from her. I'm not trying to overstep but a bored three year old with no way to burn off energy is alot to handle and so I told her I don't know if I could babysit as frequently with the rules how they are. She accused me of blackmailing her.AITA here?",

She wasn't in a puffy white ballgown, it was a little sundress with pink and yellow flowers. They told me to change her clothes. I had a tee shirt and shorts in the car but she loved that dress and there was really nothing wrong with it.They've distanced themselves from us but we saw them at Christmas. They got a present for all of the kids, except for the 10 year old. She's such a shy kid, she didn't say anything but I could tell it broke her heart. I confronted my nephew and his wife about it and they said they gave presents to everyone that behaved appropriately at the wedding.

I asked him before we moved in together if he was OK with that because I do like to drink from time to time. He said he was and it hasn't been a problem the past few months.My drinking habits are well controlled - I don't drink often, once a month at *most* and usually closer to every 2-3 months. I don't wake up, go throughout my day, or have my boredom interrupted with \"Man I could use a drink.\" I don't crave alcohol, I'm not a \"Beer or two after work\" type of guy\" because I don't like the taste of alcohol that much, I just enjoy it's effects. If I'm going through emotional problems, I especially stay away from alcohol - that's just bad juju to combine the two.When I do drink its on the weekend, I have nothing important going on the next day, and I'm in the right mood where I think \"Man it'd be kinda fun to bump some tunes, play some video games, and chat with some friends *and* have a few drinks.\" I make a few cocktails, measure my intake, and usually have about 8-10 shots worth - falls under \"binge drinking\" but considering how rarely I do it I'm really not concerned about it. I've asked if I'm disruptive and have been told no, I am not - mostly because those nights I'm in bed a solid 2 hours before the rest of them go to bed.Yesterday R pulled me to the side and did an \"intervention\" on me about my \"drinking problem.\" I wondered what he was talking about and eventually it devolved into a fight where I told him to \"Stop projecting your fucking trauma onto me dude\" because it was basically him comparing polishing off a handle every night to taking half the year to finish off a single bottle.We're not talking now and he is obviously mad at me which makes me wonder AITA for what I said?Edit - I am not drinking 8-10 shots of straight liquor, back to back, and getting completely obliterated in 30 minutes.

My wife (42F) Karla has split custody of her kids with her ex husband Jonathan (45M). Everything they do is 50/50 including the medical bills. For some back ground my stepdaughter Maliyah (12F) has Trecher Collins Syndrome, and is constantly in the hospital. I don’t really know how to explain it as well as my wife would to you, but think the little boy from Wonder. Except it’s worse in real life. There is no way to explain how hard it is for Maliyah every day.Now, Jonathan and Karla have been getting into arguments over Karla not being there for surgeries and not paying for her half of the expenses. From what Karla told me she said she got mad and wanted to prove to him that she didn’t need him and told him she could pay for all the expenses.I straight out told Karla that was a stupid idea. If you have a family member with the same syndrome Maliyah has you know the surgeries get expensive. We are middle class, so paying for half wasn’t too hard when we do it together. Jonathan is high class. He has multiple business and has the money to pay for all the surgeries if he wanted. Obviously I know he shouldn’t and it definitely should be a 50/50 thing between the parents.Last night I told Karla that I’m stepping out of the medical expenses for Maliyah. She asked me what I meant and I told her I wouldn’t be helping her with them. She told me that I was being selfish and I didn’t care for Maliyah, but honestly I think that what I did wasn’t wrong.My parents said that I’m not in the wrong but my sister and brother told me that I was being cold about the situation.",

	"body" : "I (m39) am on a Christmas holiday with Wife's (f36) family.  I have a dairy allergy which means I can't eat butter, milk, yoghurt or cheese.  Everyone in the family knows this, especially my mother in law who is in charge of cooking.  First two nights for dinner we had raclette ( if you don't what that is, its basically you chop up your own vegetables and fry them on a little stand, then you add cheese which you then grill on the same stand).  - raclette is literally just fried chopped vegetables and potatoes unless you have the cheese, and further more it takes about an hour to grill enough to feel full.  Ok though, I made it through that, I just had extra nuts and chocolate, its christmas after all.So on day 3 we were to have a more substantial meal with mash potato, except MiL forgot me and put butter and milk in, and instead of telling me and saying sorry assigned this guy (Wife's sister's partner) who is known as extremely unreliable, depressed, (who also happened to be very ill and not someone you'd want makng your food at all) to make a dairy free mash.  He boiled some potatoes and blended them, making a watery potato-only soup consistency broth, and this was served on the table in a saucepan with the rest of the meal that I could have.  I asked for a bowl and poured out a portion of the potatoes, and then offered it round to others.  No-one wanted any, including the guy who made it, and this was the point in which I just had enough, and got serious angry (inside).So I made an excuse about having promised to call my Mum and picked up the remaining meal and  bowl of watery potatoes and left to another room where I called my Mum, and I poured it down the toilet and just ate bread until I was full.Wife came in absolutely fuming telling me I'd hurt the guy's feelings, and that it was so rude to leave the dinner table. I laid my cards on the table, why have I not been thought of for every single meal, I'm never asked what I want, and its not hard to make things dairy free, or to buy some extra stuff etc etc. Wife says I should just suck it up, and that the guy made an effort.  I replied that he is not a kid, if I made something that atrocious I would not expect anyone to eat it like he was a child whose feelings I shouldn't hurt.  I'm now in the dog house, apparently no-one bought my needing to call my Mum story. AITA here?EDIT: I forgot to mention they all barely speak English, as we are in France, my wife is half French.  This goes some of the way perhaps to me not being involved in meal discussions.EDIT 2: It's not really possible for me to cook my own food in this situation, its hard to explain but MiL and that side of the family are the cooks, and we don't really get input, and we offer to help and are turned down.EDIT 3: MiL has known me for 5 years, and knows about the intolerance.  She is just forgetting me, which is ok, it happens.  I basically got mad because they served me something basically inedible, and acted like nothing was wrong rather than just saying sorry and getting me bread.EDIT 4: A lot of people want to know what else there was. We had a portion of fried pork, and there was a saucepan of cabbage. No bread, so without the potatoes the meal was just pork and cabbage.EDIT 5: it’s a cows milk intolerance meaning lactaid doesn’t work.EDIT 6: Lots of people are still saying I should fix my own meals or go to the shops and get my own supplies. This is not really a polite thing in this situation otherwise I would 100pc do that. You have to trust me on this one that it was not an option and that more offense would be caused if I offered to do that.Reading the balance it’s quite a mixture. I think I handled the situation poorly, but I don’t know what the correct plan of action would be without having to a) publicly reject eating it this offending MiL and the other guy or b) pretend to like it and potentially be forced to eat an entire pan of it. I would have taken b if potentially any of the others at the table had decided to try it, but it just felt humiliating as everyone could see how bad it was and it would be obvious that I was faking enjoyment.  I think if I had better social skills I could have maybe joked my way through perhaps… perhaps it wouldn’t have been humiliating to fake enjoyment and I could have just raised my eyebrows at everyone to let them know I was just being polite.FINAL UPDATE:  we just had breakfast I apologized for leaving the table and doubled down on my mum phone call excuse (I’d promised a certain time yada yada) and said it was nothing to do with the meal. The guy apologized for messing up the potatoes I said they were fine and that I was sorry he thought I left the table because of that. Everyone seems satisfied, but I’m pretty sure everyone knows the real reason I left. I will play some chess with the guy later to mend things further with him.OK FINAL FINAL EDIT: I'm slightly shocked by some of the reples - some of y'all are clearly from a different planet. Yes its quite rude to leave dinner half way through and yes it's quite rude to serve someone food they wouldn't want to eat, but neither is actually as terrible as some of you seem to think - everyone makes mistakes from time to time, and sometimes there is a bit of drama!  Everyone is friends now and has forgotten the incident.  It was just an unfortunate situation where I didn't have a good 'out'.",

	"body" : "So we've been living together for over a year now in college and we have 1 attached bathroom. My roommate is the laziest person I know and lays down for days on end. He also uses the bathroom for hours every time he goes in and 3+ hours when he needs to \"trim his beard\" twice a week. He also needs \"minimum 45 minutes\" in the bathroom every morning, so if we have 8 AM class, I am expected to be done and ready by 7:15 AM. It sounds completely unreasonable and I too could've used some extra sleep on some days since I only need about 10 minutes in the bathroom anyway, but he's a really old friend of mine so I try to adjust.Like this, he also \"reserves\" the bathroom from x time to x time because he has to get ready to go somewhere and I'm just not to use it during that interval. I'm happy to coordinate as well because I hardly need much time in the bathroom. The problem is that he is also the laziest person I know, so even though I'm not using the bathroom BECAUSE of him, he also continues to lay down and not use it at all, and the bathroom just stays empty/unused. Now if I try to use it after that, suddenly he too has to use it and will knock continuously saying \"dude I have class too\", even though 90% of the time he ends up not going anyway.If I tell him how he doesn't use the bathroom nor does he let me, he'll say things like \"yes but it's my time so it doesn't matter when I go as long as you don't go\", but the bathroom isn't like a plane seat that you can \"reserve\" right? It's a shared asset.So I've now started to wait for 10 minutes only, and use the bathroom anyway while ignoring his knocking during his \"reserved\" time (if I do need to use the bathroom), which brings me here. I don't mind letting him \"reserve\" the bathroom as long as he at least uses it, but him just laying down while I just have to wait till his time is over really bothers me. AITA?Edit: thanks for all the replies. The reason I chose to stay with my roommate is because I have known him since school and I've had other roomies before and the male crowd (Indian college, single sex hostels) is absolutely terrible here, and hygiene was nonexistent with both my previous roommates, and this guy is clean at least.",

I was kinda curious for my other family and went to meet her. My mom married and had another daughter Mindy (17) and a son (13). Her two siblings were also there when I visited her. I want to say it was an emotional reunion but I seriously don’t know this woman and she was pale and weak on her bed so other than some sympathy and pity I didn’t feel much for her.Everyone else left except her nurse.

She also said my mom was sick and incapable of making any logical decisions and I took advantage of her unwell state when I just accepted the bracelet.

We started dating over 2 years ago and I met her family on their first visit to the college and they included me in lunch. Ever since I have kept in regular contact with them and when they visit Ember, they make sure they spend some time with me as well. They are really awesome people and have made me feel so included. They even buy me gifts for my birthday and Christmas.Ember and I moved in together in July and her family flew out to help us set up. They were so incredibly helpful to us and they invited us to Christmas dinner at that point. I say us but I really mean me since Ember goes to them anyway. It meant so much to me and I immediately said yes.My mom was bothered by it when I told her and she put pressure on me to change my mind and go \"home\" right up until Christmas. I always told her I was going to Ember's family and never wavered or made this unclear to her. She just assumed I would choose her anyway.So there's some background to this I should explain right here. I come from a \"blended\" family. I say \"blended\" because it really wasn't very well blended lol. My mom had me, met my stepdad when I was 2 or 3. He was a widower with a 6 and 8 year old. They got married. They also had two children together. My mom's family were never part of my life. They were in and out of jail for various things so mom didn't include them. I never knew my father or his family. My stepdad's family never saw me as one of their own. My stepsiblings had family from their mom's side who were very involved too. And growing up I always felt very out of place and like I didn't belong anywhere. My step and half siblings all had at least one set of grandparents who adored them and they had a great relationship with. I had no extended family. My stepsiblings never saw me as their brother and were distant. I was around both stepdad's family and his first wife's family and I always felt awkward. I was overlooked. Any inclusion was lesser than full inclusion other kids in the family had. I got it, especially with my stepsiblings family, but it would have been easier to stay at home. My mom never really got it or had much to say about it and my stepdad was never someone I felt I could talk to.Anyway, going home was not something I felt good about because I normally had to see all these people who didn't really want me. Christmas 2022 was rough for that very reason. I loved my Christmas with Ember's family though. Mom was so pissed at me for choosing to go there instead of home. She said we're not married yet and we're still so young we should be with our own family for Christmas. I told her I went there because I actually feel like I'm part of the family instead of being around a huge extended \"blended\" family where nobody fucking wants me.

No one treats M any differently now that we know (and my dad always knew and didn’t care), so why would I go around advertising it?Dan says he looks at my relationship with M totally differently now. He says he feels a bit weird about how he’s observed us behaving now that he knows we’re not even related (we are NOT Folger’s siblings so idek what he’s talking about). He says there’s a part of him that’s wondering if I didn’t tell him so that it would make our “lack of boundaries” less of a red flag.Dan is not a jealous or controlling person I’m the slightest, so this has me quite shocked. He seems really hurt and worried about it and I’m wondering if this is a big deal and I’m just desensitised because it’s my own situation?My mother has warned me about being close with M being a red flag to guys so I’m now second guessing if it really does look from the outside like I was hiding it?The reaction is so out of character for Dan I’m really starting to feel like I messed up but at the same time, I also don’t get why it’s a big deal that we don’t share blood?edit because I saw a few people asking about what my mother said. She’s a bit conservative so I think she’s overreacting but this whole thing just reminded me. She mentioned it at a time when M and I were living together, and she said men might be uncomfortable because we’re roommates, and M is protective of me. We also have matching tattoos, which my mother says is weird (but she also just hates that I have a tattoo so I don’t take that too seriously) and that he gave me a Cartier love bracelet that I wear all the time. Also he apparently has a habit of touching my neck that she finds weird (I say “apparently” because yes he does this sometimes to steer me in a crowded room or a signal if we’re in social situations the same way you would nudge someone under the table to get their attention, but I don’t consider it a “habit”)Edit 2 - when Dan said “lack of boundaries” he just means I tell M a lot of things and ask for his advice a lot. He does the same with me. It’s not related to anything physicalFor anyone asking how we were meant to be related - My dad presented M as the son from his short lived marriage to his ex (M is 9 years older than me), so we thought we were half siblings. Turns out his mother and my father had separated by the time he was conceived but my dad went along with M being his “son” because he wanted a child.",

	"body" : "Me and my friends got together for a late Xmas gathering and we did secret Santa with a budget of $250. Well it was a not so secret secret Santa, where we knew who each person got but it was so we would only buy one person gifts so no one would go ott.EDIT for info: the budget was $250 as in expectation was each person spend that amount. It wasn’t a max $250 budget where you can spend within your means. Plus this person has a higher paying job than me and is better off financially as well and the whole friendship group agreed to this amount months before. I also saw gifts she gave to her own family when she posted on insta, all branded items.I spent the $250 and bought my secret Santa a dior silk scarf (DIOR OBLIQUE MITZAH SCARF to be precise).UPDATE for info- she wasn’t my secret Santa, but she got gifted a ysl card holder from her secret Santa which cost more than $250I was excited to receive my gift since $250 is quite a lot so should be enough to get a good gift. Everyone else got some sort of branded item whether it be skincare, makeup, accessories etc. However when I opened my gift it was all handmade items.It was two resin coasters(which weren’t made very well I could see the bubbles), some bracelets made out of yarn (those friendship bracelets you have when you’re younger- we’re all in our 40s!!), a crocheted turtle and a painting she did(it’s watercolour I think?).I jokingly asked her how this costs $250 and she dead seriously responded that the kits cost money and crocheted animals are sold for quite a lot of sites like etsy, and a bespoke commissioned painting is priceless??Now I understand that it’s the thought that counts, and if she couldn’t afford the $250 I would have understood. But it’s not that she couldn’t afford it, she just decided to give me these items because she wanted to ‘try making them’. It’s like oh you didn’t want this junk so gifted it to me?AITA for not appreciating these gifts? Apparently I’ve really upset her by not being happy about what I received, but honestly if she had even added a $50 Starbucks card I would have been happier.Everyone else said I was over reacting and that it’s a decent gift, but that’s because they all got good branded items? I would happily trade my gifts for the dior scarf back, but obviously she said noEDIT for info: no she’s not a crafty person, she was just bored and watched too many crafty YouTube shorts/ instagram reels so was just passing the time by buying cheap kits off amazon And the painting she did was more like follow a YouTube tutorial and hope for the best - I also wont be hanging it anywhere in the house, she knows my daughter loves art and we have her pieces dotted around our house",

	"body" : "My (53m) daughter (31f) recently announced her second pregnancy to the whole family who was delighted as she has been struggling since her first one.My brother died at 27, I was 21. My mom was always a very career oriented person, we own a family business which he was supposed to take over. We never talked about him, ever. One month after his accident she had already erased his name from all the official papers, got his belongings sold or given and took me as her successor in his place. I was angry at her for showing no empathy, at my dad for saying nothing and letting his son’s memory be scratched over like it was nothing, but still I said nothing.I got married to Jenna (55f),a good friend. She was there for me through tough times, when my brother’s absence was unbearable. We had three beautiful daughters before we got divorced amicably. We’re still friends to this day. I got remarried to Sam (50f) under my mother’s advice. We had kids and she took over my mom’s business as she was more fit than I in those matter.Everyone knows of my brother even though I never talk about it because I just can’t. I know I am at fault for not wanting to stop grieving, but I do not know how to deal with this loss either way. Helen is now fixed on giving her son my brother’s name, not because she wants to honor him as she never knew him but because it’s “pretty and unique”.Jenna told her it was not a good idea and that there was plenty of pretty names she could use. But she is making it personal even though she knows how painful it is for me. Sam is totally on her side as she find me irrational and stupid, she treats me like a mad man and told me I have no say in how Helen deal with her kids. I do get her point, but I find their behaviour cruel and the reason is straight up stupid. I could have understand if Helen was not so impersonal, like this name meant nothing. Just “pretty and unique”. Am I crazy for refusing to let her use a name that means so much to me, that bring so much painful memories to mind for a reason as superficial as that? I asked her and she brushed it off saying after so long it doesn‘t make sense to still associate his name with painful memories, instead of creating new ones with her child. I don’t understand how giving his name to someone else will erase the pain of losing him.  People grief differently and I was never one to talk about it. But just that one time I would like for them to let me be. Helen said I was being self centred as everyone found the name pretty and I was just trying to make it about me.  Her and Sam are not believing my pain to be genuine.They are now siding together and have been talking to my other kids who are taking turn to make me change my mind, I feel cornered and except Jenna, nobody is actually trying to see things from where I stand. I have been resenting my mom for this my whole life and now my own family is being dismissive about my brother’s death. Am I the Asshole ?",

He will constantly snooze Alexa through all 7 ALARMS (in 15-minute intervals) and continue sleeping through his phone alarms because they don't seem to do anything.

We have been friends for years now and I love her a lot, she has always been there for me and we've been through a lot together.The one thing Tess was the most excited for was her bachelorette, she has been talking about it even before she got engaged (which is why I feel so guilty). I also helped her plan our vegas trip and we were supposed to leave this week.But a few days ago, Jason got laid off of work. Even though he saw it coming, it hit him hard. He's just  stressed and really upset. He didn't even tell me at first because he didn't want me to be worried but when he finally told me I just knew I couldn't go anymore.I was really conflicted, and I knew what this meant to Tess and that I'm the MOH, but I just couldn't even consider going to vegas while Jason is this upset. He's a strong guy but I felt like he shouldn't go through this alone.I worked up the courage to call Tess and it just went so much worse than I planned. Tess thought I was joking first, and then she just became really angry which is understandable, but I wish she understood my situation too. Tess at first told me to do whatever and cut the call, she didn't respond when I tried contacting her again.After that she sent me a lot of messages saying that I'm stealing her special day, and started questioning why I accepted to be made of honour if I didn't want to do the duties that came along with it. She said I'm untrustworthy  and jealous, that I'm ruining her special moment for a guy I've only known for a year.I'll admit, I usually don't accept Tess's offers to go clubbing and she blames that on Jason being controlling, but in reality but I've explained that, I just turned into a homebody because I never really enjoyed that stuff in the first place. I  still go out with her a lot, I make sure I'm there for her. But for her bachelorette I was willing to do that and more. I really did want to go and make it special.She told me that her whole plan will fall through, because I was the one with the plan. I told her I'll explain it all to one of our other friends.But she said I don't have to because I'm no longer her friend, that hurt a lot to hear.One one hand, I don't regret my decision, Jason needs me and Tess should understand how difficult this is for us. But also, this is a once in a lifetime trip, and she has been dreaming about it since forever. I'm also the one who planned a lot of the stuff. Our mutuals also reached out to let me know that Tess was very angry, and that what I did was not cool.Now I'm doubting myself, and I need to know if I have to apologise.I obviously can't ask anyone I know, Jason thinks I'm right, and I'm sure Derek and the bridesmaids think Tess is right.

A couple of months before I turned 16, she started dating a guy, and he didn't like me at all. I always had to be elsewhere when he came around. Shortly after my 16th birthday, my mom told me I was going to spend the weekend on my uncles farm. So I went and it was pretty fun. She didn't show up the day she was supposed to pick me up, so I called her, and she basically told me I was staying with my uncle permanently. When I told him he was pissed, rightfully so. We both tried calling her, but she didn't answer. We did everything we could think of to get a hold of her, but we couldn't. The last time I saw her was a week later when she dropped off the rest of my clothes.My uncle is technically not my uncle. He's just a family friend, but he's the closest thing I've had as a parent for the last 5 years. (My dad and I aren't close. Apparently, his house was too full for me when my mom left). Honestly, a big part of me is glad this happened.Shorty after I moved in, I got my own horse. She's a clydesdale named Mary(6f) and she's my best friend. I've been working on the ranch with my uncle since I graduated and I'm really liking it. I feel at peace.Anyway, my mom showed up to the ranch today, I had just got on Mary. It was funny, she didn't recognize me at first. She came up to me and asked if I'd dismount. I didn't. She told me this story about how she moved across the country with her ex because she thought she'd be happy with him then she told me that things didn't work out so she found a place. Then she basically demanded I \"come home.\"I sarcastically said \"sure\" and I got Mary to start walking. That set her off. She started after me and started ranting about how I needed to live a \"normal life\" and that I had to find a girlfriend and not ride horses all day. I stopped and said \"as far as you're concerned, this horse is my girlfriend,\" and that set her off even more. My uncle caught wind of what was happening and he came over and asked her to leave. She shouted \"I'm not leaving without my son!!\" My uncle told her to leave again and threatened to call the cops if she didn't and that got her to leave.The reason I'm making this post is because my dad just sent me this long text about how my mom misses me and how she only wants what's best for me. He then went on to say that I should give her a chance instead of threatening to call the cops. He ended the text by saying I was an asshole for not even getting off my horse to speak with her.AITA for walking away when my mom tried to talk to me?Editing to add: my horse isn't my girlfriend.

So to everyone saying I’m not answering suspicious questions, I literally cantI (26f) spent 22-26 of December with my bf’s (“Luke”) family, staying at his parents’ house along with his sister, her husband, and their kids.It was a long few days to say the very least. It’s very cramped quarters (3 bedrooms, 1 full bathroom), and very different to my own family’s Christmas. Luke’s family, his mother especially, are not my biggest fan (totally fair, as we’re all very different), his niece and nephew are unruly, they eat food that I don’t, all in all, not what I would call a good time. Nevertheless, I went to Christmas at Luke’s request and tried my best to make sure I was not a burden or embarrassment to Luke while he tried to spend time with his family.Today, we left to go home, and tomorrow I will be going to see my mother for a few days before returning for New Year’s, when Luke and I will be attending my friend’s party. The party is a black tie event that Luke is not looking forward to as he doesn’t know/like anyone going besides me.In the car on the way home, he joked that he really wasn’t looking forward to going. I joked back that I made a sacrifice going to his family for Christmas, so now it was his turn, and at least the party was only a few hours. Luke got offended that I said seeing his family was a sacrifice and asked if I really meant that. I said yes, I did, obviously I did, since I pretty much subsisted on coffee for 3 days, his niece ruined a piece of my personalised luggage set, and his family clearly don’t like me. I said I was happy to go for him, and I would do it again, but it wasn’t enjoyable for me beyond seeing him happy.This was apparently deeply offensive as he said he felt like he’d had a nice family Christmas and that I’d ruined the memories now that he knew I was pretending the whole time. I’m a bit confused as to how he would think I legitimately enjoyed being cold, hungry, and having no privacy for days on end, and not being with my family for Christmas. But either way, it was a choice I was happy to make for him and it’s not the end of the world.I don’t see how I’m the AH for pointing out (humorously and with no malice) that I made a sacrifice for Luke, but he’s been cold to me since I said it. Am I missing something here?Edit: It won’t let me comment since this is a new account (don’t have the karma) so for everyone asking about the food/why I mostly had coffee, I didn’t want to seem like a jerk for buying and cooking my own food while there. Luke and I went to the store and I get a few snacks that I didn’t need to keep in the kitchen so as not to offend his family but obviously I couldn’t he eating those all the time. So at breakfast I had coffee, for lunch had another coffee/snack and for dinner I just ate what I could of whatever they were having (normally a bit of the side dishes). I thought it would come across really rude to buy and then use their kitchen to cook myself a whole separate meal.",

My dad decided to surprise our stepmom with first-class seats for just the two of them on our flight back from our grandma's house. So that left me and my step/half siblings alone in the regular seats. Our cousin attends the same college as me in my home state but lives in the same state as our grandma. She pretty last minute decided to fly out later (she wanted to stay home with our grandma for NYE) which left an empty seat on the flight.So prior to the flight, my sister Lucy got sick. I think it is the flu but idk. Anyway, I loaded my carry-on with trash bags, Clorox wipes, and car trees in case she got sick on the plane.  she was sitting next to me. and in the row directly next to us my step-sister Sarah, half-brother Jacob, and cousin (who didn't show up) were supposed/sat.all was fine and dandy Lucy made it all the way to boarding before she started feeling sick again. I prepared for a flight of me apologizing and trying to clean.We board and a lady is sitting in the aisle seat in our row. I kindly asked her if she could move to the window seat because Lucy wasn't feeling well and I wanted her to have easy bathroom access. She argued with me about getting there first before finally moving to the window seat.once the flight was boarded and the doors shut they told us we had a small delay. I looked across the aisle and saw my siblings had an open seat (they didn't put a standby person in my cousin's seat which I assumed would happen). So I turned to the lady sitting next to me in the window and asked her if she wanted to move to that seat.That way she could have her aisle seat back and she wouldn't have to sit with a sick child. The lady then began to yell at me about how rude I was. and how she wasn't moving from the seat she paid for.eventually, the flight attendant came over and asked what was going on. I explained the situation and the attendant told me I couldn't ask anyone to move and left. The lady called me a bitch and entitled.I later told my stepmom and my Dad about it and they agreed I was being rude, an ass, and annoying that poor woman. My mom (agreed with me) I was trying to be polite and offer the woman her original seat choice back. But my stepmom thinks I embarrassed her and my dad. They don't want to fly with me anymore because of this.Was I being an ass in this situation? I was really genuinely trying to be nice. Now I feel shitty.",

Him and his mom have never really been close.Now for a little back story, we are both at odds with my MIL and it all started less than 24 hours after I had my son. My husband and I told both my MIL and my mother that we did not want our son's birth turned into a photo op. People taking pictures of me have always made me uncomfortable. My son had some complications immediately after he was born and he was rushed to the NICU. I wasn't able to see him for roughly 9 hours. Once I was allowed to go into the NICU my husband went with me as this was the first time I was officially meeting my newborn son. Next thing I know I look up and see my MIL using this opportunity as a photo op. I WAS FUMING. These were not the first pictures I wanted of my son or of my husband and I with our son. The next morning my MIL decided she wanted to come back and see our son who is now safe and in our room. I am running on maybe 2 hours of sleep, but still said it was okay for her to come. Once she was there I didn't really interact with her. I was just trying to rest. After she left she ended up calling my husband. This is when he decided to call her out on the photo op and how she completely violated a boundary that we clearly set.Her response floored me. She began yelling at my husband saying that I hate her, that I don't like her and I never have. That I am so hateful towards her. She said her reasoning for taking the pictures was because she thought that we would want to remember that moment and to her it wasn't a big deal and she didn't see the point of getting upset.Once all this happened I decided I needed to distance myself from her and focus on my new family. My husband agreed with doing this as well.Fast forward to about a week and a half ago. My husband and son had been sick for over a week. I was out doing errands and getting groceries. MIL asked me multiple times if I wanted anything from Sams Club. I would constantly tell her \"no, but thank you.\" She was doing the same to my husband and he would also respond \"no we are good thanks\". I return home and my son was screaming. He hadn't slept all day. We all decided to try to nap. My husband finally falls asleep and I finally get my son to fall asleep. About 10 minutes later there is a knock on my door. My dog goes flying and barking her head off waking up my son. I answer the door and say \"why are you here\". She says I wanted to bring you a rotisserie chicken, a trash can, and laundry detergent. I told her we already said we didn't want anything and to not show up at our house unannounced and that next time she tries to give us random crap I will immediately return it to her we don't want anything from her. She got angry and said \"she will never come over or speak to us again\" and slammed the door. AITA?",

	"body" : "I’ve never actually used Reddit before so sorry if there are any mistakes.So, I (14f) have an older sister (19f) who we will call “Ella”. Ella is staying at home with me and my parents for university until she graduates or finds an affordable apartment for rent.Anyway to give a little context my family is pretty busy. My mom is a nurse so she is gone very early and isn’t back until sometimes very late and my dad also gets up early as well. (I’m not exactly sure what he does but I know it has something to do with finance) So because of this I have to get myself ready in morning. Since my parents aren’t here in the morning I’ve set up a routine. I’ll usually pack my lunch, snack etc the night before and put it in the fridge to take it to school the next morning and it works out great.UNTIL my sister moved in. For a little context my sister is also out of the house before I wake up and I’ve started to notice that she would take my lunch, leaving me with nothing to eat. I just assumed she didn’t know it was mine which was a little annoying but I just told her to stop taking them. She agreed and all was well until last week Friday.Friday morning I was supposed to go to school and she took my lunch AGAIN and I had to buy myself something small with pocket money and I had enough so I decided I was done. I woke early on Saturday morning before she was awake and just took her sandwich. (For more context cause I know people will be confused, she goes to the library with her friends on some Saturday’s and that’s the only time she’ll actually pack her own lunch) Anyway I took it and started eating it for breakfast. Needless to say when she came downstairs and saw me eating her food she got mad.We got into a fight and I ended up telling her that this was how I felt every time she was to lazy to make her own food and ate mine instead. I went back upstairs and by the time I came back down she was gone.My parents weren’t happy when they found out what happened and told us to figure it out ourselves so now I’m kind of feeling bad.

	"body" : "My daughter's father and I separated when she was less than 1 year old and it was a messy divorce, he tried very hard to have full custody and did everything possible to ruin my image in front of the judge.The judge didn't agree, because she was very young, weekend visits were established and when she turned 1.5 years old, she became a 50/50 guard and has remained that way to this day (she is 3 years old).We didn't have a healthy co-parenting,  but we are slowly improving and  currently have a friendly relationship  our daughterIt was established in the guard that the holidays would be divided equally. Last year, on 2 different holidays that would have been mine, he talked to me asking if could stay with our daughter, as his family was going to get together at a house with a pool and he would like her to go. I agreed and didn't mind exchanging it for one of his Sundays, but obviously I would have liked to spend it with my daughter because in one case it was a \"2 day\" holiday. I never asked for this.At Christmas, my family would go to the beach from the 23rd to the 26th and this year on Christmas Eve/Christmas our daughter would stay with him. In November, I asked if we could change it for the new year, because it would be a family trip, etc. and I would love to take her* .He immediately said no and that he already had plans, going back and forth, I reminded him that I did the same for him several times and he would be doing me a lot of help, he responded with it's just go with our custody agreement , let's follow it. I didn't say anything else, but I decided that if we're going to follow the custody agreement the way he wants, I don't see the point in always compromising myself if he won't do the same for me.Next month there will be a holiday of mine and he sent me a message, saying the same thing as the other times he asked and I said I wouldn't change it, as it was my day with her.He started to insist, saying that we exchanged it for a holiday or Sunday, but I stood my ground even more because it was a great holiday for me with more free days and it was the only one I insisted on having for that reason.He didn't like it, saying I should be more committed. I had my limit and made it very clear that we were to respect our custody agreement.This exploded, saying that I was being petty towards him for Christmas, being that it is an important holiday and I should understand that I should be better for our co-parenting.This is not a subject that is at peace, because he is still calling me petty and vindictive, but I don't think it's fair to compromise if he won't do the same.AITA?Some points I made in the comments, but I'll put them hereI don't have Christmas with my daughter, I don't care much about the date and I don't care about keep the New Year. My request was much more for the family trip. Of the 4 Christmases we've been apart, he's kept them all and I've never asked to change that, except last year and I don't want to change this year.He asked for Carnival (basically 4 days - Saturday to Tuesday). Not a minor holiday in my country. I gave up last year Carnival.",

It was from his grandma’s jewellery collection and I wear it everyday.Jake proposed to my mom when I was 12 and we were really close.

They tolerate my mom and me on holidays and are civil for Jake.A few weeks after my graduation, Jake and my mom passed in an accident and the last year has been really hard on me.I fell out with Jake’s extended family when I was organising their funerals- Jake was brought up Christian and his family wanted to hold his funeral in their family church. My mom and me are atheist and I know she wanted to be cremated, so this many their funerals would be separate.I asked James family if we could have a joint wake for my mom and Jake but they insisted on doing it in their church hall which I refused as my mom was not religious and wanted to do it at my mom and Jake’s house. We fell out over this and I haven’t spoke to them since as they decided to hold a wake for Jake in the church and not invite me.Yesterday, I got a message from Jake’s mom asking for the necklace Jake gave me. She said it’s a family heirloom, to be added to the oldest daughter and she wanted to give it to Jake’s sister who is pregnant. I refused as Jake gave it to me, and she got very hostile and threatened to sue me. I am not sure if she can as Jake was never married to my mom or officially my dad, but he was my dad regardless.",

	"title" : "WIBTA for not accepting the condition of shortening my wedding ceremony?",
	"body" : "Hey y'all 29M here. Apologies in advance for mobile formatting issues.A couple of days ago my fiancée (28F) attended my cousin's bridal shower. My cousin's MOH was there and my fiancée interacted with her while my other cousin and her friend were there to witness this interaction. Somehow, the topic came up about our wedding and the MOH's wedding. It was then that my fiancée learned that both our wedding and the MOH's wedding ceremony were going to be at the same church. However, it was revealed that MOH's ceremony was supposed to be at the same time as ours. My fiancée had brought this to her attention and she started becoming upset. She stated they had booked the ceremony a year in advance through her aunt who is the bookkeeper of the church. She also claimed that her father donated a lot of money to the church and because of that, whenever she wanted the ceremony to be, she would definitely have her way. Our ceremony and situation would therefore need to be sorted out on our end because she claimed with confidence that we were somehow wrong in what we believed.After this interaction, my fiancée was also upset and my other cousin and friend felt the MOH was out of line for her attitude and comments. After the bridal shower, we spoke on the phone and she relayed what happened. I too was upset that such things were said as we were seemingly in the wrong. After my fiancée consulted her mom, they decided to call the priest directly the following day in order to make sure what was going on and that hopefully he did not provide us the wrong information or write down the wrong date. After an anxiety filled night and morning, he  confirmed with my fiancée we were in fact the couple set for that date and time.Unfortunately, that wasn't the end of it, as he called a couple of hours later. He told us the MOH'S family reached out to him to also confirm information and that they do not have that day for their ceremony. He then asked my fiancée if we were willing to cut our time and ceremony as we would normally be alloted an hour after the ceremony for pictures and other things we wanted to do in the church. He stressed that he did not want to sway our decision in any way and that he would respect what we decide as it was solely at our discretion. Because of the negative experience we had with the MOH, and the fact that neither her nor her family reached out to us directly, we would not be cutting our time short so that they may have a ceremony on the same day.After speaking with my mom and aunt about what went on, they didn't really support our feelings on the matter. My aunt also said I should be the bigger person and accept the condition so that the MOH could have her ceremony. I'm now conflicted, so WIBTA?Edit: I appreciate all your comments as it definitely helped me to confirm my and my fiancée's feelings on the matter. I also wanted to point out that yes, it was my cousin's MOH and not my fiancée's throughout this entire post. We don't know her at all and barely know the MOH'S fiance. I also wanted to clarify that when we initially tried to book the church ceremony, the priest informed us there were two time slots for that day, one at 11 AM and one at 2 PM. The 11 AM was already taken so we chose the 2 PM and were told it was fine.This discussion occurred in September as our marriage class occurred from May-June. What's baffling to us is that in-between when she apparently booked a year in advance, which would mean May, and all the way until September, she did not confirm her time once or even any time after. If she had confirmed any time before September, we would've known and looked for another church. I will also keep in mind the advice given to have a back up in place in case we do end up strong-armed to relinquish our time.",

To make it worse, my middle name is Rifle. Yes I’m not kidding. Basically my mum picked my first name and my dad did the middle name, unfortunately I have no ways of finding out what was the reason for that choice as they’re no longer with us.I have a coworker (F33) who’s a bitch baby about my name for some reason.

For reference her name is Kate, maybe she’s jealous bc she has a boring ass name idk.So I got fed up with her bullshit and started calling her Kathleen, Catelyn, Kylie, whatever just not Kate. Of course it made her like super upset and she started whining about how I’m being a bully. I said it’s her who’s being a bully who constantly misspells my name. She said my name is too hard, I told her to use my middle name instead and she started bitching that it’s “trashy” and “not an actual name”. Like I said I didn’t take no shit this time and told her that until she starts respecting my name I won’t be respecting hers. She said that I’m a bully and an asshole.I reckon that maybe my response wasn’t the gentlest but tbh I felt like she should get a taste of her own medicine.

	"body" : "Throwaway just in case. My child R (12f) is invited to a sleepover. She has 3 bffs, A (12f), N (12f), and B (12m) (all friends since 1st grade). Since starting middle school they have had regular sleepovers. We have been able to avoid hosting one at Ns house until now.Ns mother, T, is not my favorite person. We live in a U.S. suburb but T and I come from the same area a few states over. We graduated from neighboring HS. My hometown has some vocal bigots and T has echoed some of that sentiment over the years. We are black and R’s friends are white. We live in a well off area. I’m a scientist (PhD) for a government contractor and my husband has a MBA and owns a consulting firm.When we first met T at R’s 7th birthday she “jokingly” asked how we could afford our home and if we were drug dealers…it was awkward but I let it go. It is a lazy stereotype to imply black people with a nice house are criminals. I assumed she was just awkward or nervous. Over the years she has made “jokes” about me being “light skinned”, saying I’m an affirmative action hire, how it is easier for blacks to get into college than whites, etc. I have tried to question her logic but I confront her bs with more patience than she deserves so R doesn’t lose a friend. Part of me hopes that she grows/learns from our interactions.I grew up poor and black around poor white people. I understand that class oppression is real. I am certain T has experienced the oppression of capitalism but that doesn’t mean that I also haven’t experienced it just because I am better off now. I spent most of my childhood living in a trailer park. It was not easy being black and poor in rural America.Bs family are very wealthy and I’ve never heard T say a single thing rude in their home. Although she did initially have ann issue with B taking part in the sleepovers until As mom pointed out that they are kids and B is openly gay. As parents are working class white people. As mom has spoken up a few time when she heard T say racist nonsense. We’ve never talked about it directly but As mom and I have shared a few poignant looks over the years.All of this makes me unsure what R will experience at Ns house. I won’t be there to protect her. N is a kind child. Her and R are close and I trust my daughter to pick good people. I don’t want to punish or isolate N because her mom has problematic views. N doesn’t seem to share her views. N has talked to me about how she wants to be a scientist and asked questions about grad school and my job. My husband agrees with my concerns but doesn’t think anything will happen. I haven’t said anything to R, just that I needed to check our schedule next weekend.I think I’d be an asshole for causing drama and tension between a group of 12 year olds who just want to have a sleepover.

They're a young nuclear family, two parents in their 30's with a little baby.We aren't the type of neighbors to spy into yards or monitor what everyone is doing so we hadn't really noticed that their backyard is a pigsty, at least not until our fence panels had been broken. These neighbors had been piling trash and leaning it up against OUR fence, and eventually the sheer weight of it had just broken it, causing it all to spill into our yard. There were old pieces of wood, metal, garbage bags, pieces of furniture and just general clutter and crap.I confronted the neighbors and informed them of what happened. I asked politely that they clear up the garbage and contribute some money towards a new fence. The husband said he'd sort it out, but after 2 weeks of no change, I knocked on their door again. The wife gave some excuse about how the baby has been crazy but that they would get rid of the garbage asap. Another 3 weeks and nothing. I knocked on their door at two different times, left messages on their ring doorbell and messaged them both on Facebook and it has been radio silence. They've also not given us any money for the fence but to be honest I don't even care.After no response for another week, I took matters into my own hands. I loaded up THEIR garbage into my car and took it to the dump. They're now angry and said that we have no right to get rid of their stuff and it's still their property. When the wife turned up at our door we got into a small argument as she threatened me with small claims court, saying that we owe her and her husband money. I called her a Karen and told her if the stuff  was so important she shouldn't have left it littered around in my yard where my kids play for over a month. She says that they would've gotten rid of it if they were given a chance, the nearest dump is over an hours drive away and they dont have all the time in the world. AITA?",

He paused when he was about to put cereal in his mouth and gave me an almost \"are you serious\" sort of look.

I got several options for them for food;Breakfast: Yogurt parfait, sourdough bread (homemade) and croissants, a bunch of things to put on bread, eggs, OJ, coffee and tea.Lunch: soups (tomato and potato leek), grilled cheese / bread rolls.Dinner: eggplant parm with salad and garlic bread one day, and chili with rice, sour cream and cheese for the next.These are all things they can eat and enjoyed eating in the past (though usually with meat mixed in/as a side). I've provided more for them then they have for me. But according to my dad it wasn't enough. He insisted on going on to buy some ground beef to mix into the chili the second evening. I told him he's free to go out to eat, but he can't cook it in my kitchen.AITA?",

	"body" : "My fiancé and I have 2 kids. We agreed that I'd stay home and care for them until they both go off to school. He'd pay all the bills and such since it'd be a lot cheaper for me to stay home versus sending our disabled child to daycare.I received some money for Xmas from my dad that he told me to spend on myself and the kids. Fiancé found out about this money and asked to borrow it. I told him i didn't really want to since we needed diapers and wipes and other stuff for our kids and I planned on buying those with the money my dad gave me. (My mom ended up buying them as a late gift)Fiancé decided to write out a 'contract' that stated he legally had to pay me back in 2 weeks. I added in that if he couldn't pay it by his own deadline that he'd owe an additional $100 and he agreed to that. He signed the contract and marked it with a thumb print and everything.The first deadline was on the 13th this month. He paid me $5 back of the $125 he owed me by then. The second deadline is the 31st. He's now telling me he just can't pay it back and is saying that partners don't do this. That they're supposed to help each other out etc. I told him it was his idea for the contract and that he agreed to both terms (its even on video of him signing it btw)My thing is, I wouldn't be so pressed about being paid back if the day I lent him the money he didn't decide to buy $60 worth of weed instead of paying his car note like he said he would.He's saying I should be more than glad to help my partner who's struggling. Which I would be. If he wouldn't spend his bill money on weed and the lottery.So I told him either he can pay back the full amount of $225 that he AGREED to paying me or he will get absolutely nothing from me anymore. I have zero income. The money I get is gifted to me by family or on the rare occasion from him. I've been trying to find a work from home job but haven't found one I qualify for yet. And since he doesn't work a regular job I can't just work on his off hours since he doesn't have a set schedule. Some days he works mornings some days he works nights and he doesn't know until the day of or the day before.AITA here?Edit: this got a lot more comments than I anticipated and I'm still trying to read through them all. I saw a lot of questions so I wanted to make an edit to answer as many as I can instead of repeating myself a million times in replies.When he and I had first gotten together he was doing a lot better financially. He wasn't spending his money on weed nearly as much as he is now. He was actually providing at first. Even when we had our first kid 4 years ago he was still pretty good. We planned on stopping at one kid until our oldest was much older so I'd gotten on birth control not long after having our oldest. My birth control ended up failing and I found out I was pregnant too late to do anything about it. At that time things were still doing a lot better than they are now so I figured things would stay good after having our second.When I was still pregnant with my youngest our oldest became disabled. She suffered a terrible fall that drastically changed everything for us. She's been in and out of the hospital more times than I can even count. It was sudden and unexpected. She was already receiving Medicaid so medical bills weren't and aren't an issue thankfully but her disability has still taken its toll on everyone.When he asked to borrow the $125 I told him no at first but he kept insisting that he'd lose his car if he didn't make the car payment. It wasn't until he answered a FaceTime call from his dealer with me sitting next to him that I found out that he had used $60 of the $125 to buy weed. I saw someone say I smoke too in the comments, I don't. I tried weed once when I was like 20 and hated it. I've told my fiancé that I was okay with him smoking as long as it didn't interfere with necessities even before having kids with him. He seemed to be on board with that for years and years then it's like a flip switched. I still don't mind him smoking, just as long as our families needs are met first.I also saw some people suggesting to do Uber eats and stuff like that, I definitely would but we are a one car family and he always has the car when he works otherwise I'd be out there doing deliveries. I have applied for disability for my oldest but the process is still on going so we haven't received payment yet. I do try to do surveys to make a little extra money every chance I get but I'm going to look into the work from home suggestions some of y'all had and try to get one asap.I do receive wic and Ebt so I buy most of the food. He buys anything extra and pays the rest of the bills- or rather he's supposed to. He doesn't tell me much about his finances so I don't know exactly how much money he has coming in and how much the bills are. When I ask him he gets pretty angry so I just drop the subject.A lot of people also suggested I should leave him. I know that's probably for the better but it's hard when you still love someone. He was a great partner for years before we had our first and he was a great father for awhile after having our first. I don't want to just throw that all away.I hope I explained things a lot better.",

When Angela tentatively asked Maggie how she's feeling about Lily and Adam's news, Maggie started screaming at her that she doesn't want to hear anything about \"that whelp\" and refused all help from everyone.

	"body" : "AITA for telling my sister and her family to leave my house after my sister started to curse at me.My sister, her husband, and my niece come to my house almost every weekend. This weekend, my daughter had committed to my niece to help her put together a lego set. They arrived at our house and when they came in my daughter was playing a game, my niece was eating some dinner they’d brought for her and my sister was eating but also was clearly expressing some anger/frustration with her husband who was in the family room playing video games with my husband. This was the plan all along— for our husbands to play games and my daughter and niece to build legos. It was super early in the night (maybe 5:30/6ish) so there was a lot of time for everyone to get to everything because they are usually here until 10:30 or 11 on a weekend.My niece finishes her food and my sister was fussing. I actually said to my husband I may leave and run some errands because I don’t like the energy in here. I packed up the food my niece didn’t finish and put it in a bag for her. My niece starts to open the legos. She’s 7 and capable to start this task—- we were letting her do her thing. My daughter was still playing her game.My sister says “Sarah, are you going to get up? Jane is opening everything and she’s ready.” Sarah responded that she was coming in just a bit. My sister goes in and starts helping my niece and says “well now you need some scissors. I thought the teen almost young adult was going to get up and help you”.This is when I chimed in with, “Sarah doesn’t have to hop up just because Jane is done eating and ready. She will be in in just a minute” and I put the pair of scissors on the table.After about 3-4 minutes Sarah goes in and starts helping. My sister is on the phone and grumbling about something else and then says “oh Sarah it’s okay I don’t want your mom to think I’m forcing you to come help”.I respond, “hey that’s not really necessary” and try to explain that I was just saying they both could be patient while Sarah finished what she was doing. My sister cuts me off and I say “listen whatever you’re upset about you don’t need to take it out on me.”She proceeds to start yelling and cursing at me. Telling me I need to shut the fuck up and I really need to not take this to another level because she’s already not in the mood and she about to “go there” with me.Without yelling I say, “you need to go. You gotta go home.”She says fine and said “I didn’t want to come over here today anyway.” I didn’t say anything and let them leave.Later my husband says “you and your sister ruined us(him and my brother in law) hanging out.” I asked okay but was I wrong? I don’t think anyone should be able to come in my home and disrupt my peace because they are in a bad mood.My husband responded “you don’t put family out of your house”.Am I the asshole???",

	"body" : "32m. I've been with my wife for 6 years and we have a 3 month old daughter. For the past year my mom has been battling with severe depression following the incarceration of my brother. He lived with her when he got locked up and she's never lived alone, so it took a toll on her mentally. He's in prison for 19 years so I don't see it changing anytime soon either. I helped her get in to therapy 6 months or so ago, following my wife making a comment about not wanting my mother here every single day. To be completely fair to my wife, it was in fact getting exhausting. My mom would show up at various times during the day without notice and hang out for hours because she didn't want to be alone and entertaining her every single day was getting super irritating. Especially given that my wife and I had zero down time or alone time. So, anyways, I got my mom in to therapy.For the past 4 months my mom has still been stopping by but it's not nearly as frequent. She got a boyfriend now so she's only been stopping by once or twice a week and doesn't stay for more than an hour. My wife still hates it but she said she will take this over how it was any day. But 2 days ago my mom showed up in hysterics. She was completely inconsolable. Her and her BF were fighting and I guess it just made all her mental anguish flood back. She asked if she could stay the night. I ran it by my wife who said \"whatever\" and locked herself away in the bedroom (she hadn't gotten any sleep the night before). I told my mom \"you can stay the night but you need to leave in the morning. I'm going to be honest with you, my wife doesn't want you here. She hasn't been sleeping and this is inconvenient.\" She said she would leave first thing in the morning. But the next day she was even worse than the night before. She was freaking out and hyperventilating because she didn't want to go home to an empty house. Said she hadn't slept at all. She was afraid of driving on no sleep, etc and asked if she could take a nap in our bed so she could be rested for the drive (our couch, where she slept, was not comfortable). My wife said that was fine but she had better be gone by the time we got back from grocery and other errands. We left at 10am. Got home at 8pmband my mom was still sleeping in our bed. The baby was super fussy and my wife was livid. She said \"go wake her the fuck up and tell her to leave or I'm going to lose my shit. This is unacceptable.\" I tried waking my mom but she kept saying \"5 more minutes\" and turning away. My wife just looked at me and said \"I'm done with this bullshit\" and packed up the baby again and left for a hotel. She said she won't come back until I go no contact with my mom and cut the umbilical chord because my mom didn't get out of my bed until nearly midnight and then went back to sleep on the couch instead of leaving.

She was even wearing new clothes and accessories. I questioned her about my items and she denied and said she never took them, i was still a little suspicious but decided to let it go as i could easily replace those items.

I leave the bathroom to see my room left in a mess, my dresser had been gone through and my nightstand was left open and everything in it was missing. I immediately went to my step sister and asked her about my missing items and she continued denying i told her i was going to check the cameras and she face went pale, I pulled out my phone and reviewed the footage to see my sister entering my room and leaving minutes later with alot of my missing items.She screamed in my face and said it was her only sorce of income and she shouldnt have to steal these things instead they should be given to her as she has been a huge help and needs the money for her son. I told her to give me back all my things or i will get the cops involved. She said no as she needed the money, So i told her to get her son and leave my house.

	"body" : "I (26f) was adopted as an infant and have never met my birth family. I did seek some answers when I was 19 with the help of my parents and it was made very clear nobody in my birth family wanted anything to do with me. I couldn't even access medical records. The reason is I was the result of an affair. My birth mother tried passing me off as her husband's but when he found out she was too far along to abort me and my birth father and his wife also wanted nothing to do with me. None of the \"siblings\" on either side wanted to know me or any of their extended families. I was the dirty piece of history they all wanted to erase. Not exactly a secret since I was known. But certainly not a person in their eyes.I wasn't really hurt by the rejection but I was frustrated by the lack of medical info, which was the primary thing I would have liked and I mentioned this when reaching out. I always had my own family so it was never about meeting my \"real\" family or anything. My real family are the people who raised me and I grew up alongside.So that's my kind of background related to my adoption.I have a cousin who is 21 and she's also adopted. She was also adopted as an infant, just like me. My uncle (dad's brother) and aunt (dad's sister in-law) are her parents. Unlike me, my cousin longed for her birth family from the moment she found out she was adopted, which happened when she was 10 and only because a cousin blabbed and not because her parents  told her. She does not have a good relationship with her parents. She struggles far more with being adopted. She really feels lost. She has confided in me before and I was always okay with that. I would support her and cheer her on when she mentioned wanting to find her birth family.But she has been unable to find out any information. And now she has fixated on this idea that I need to reach out to my birth family again. She has told me she knows it must deeply upset me and leave me with a deep longing to know them when I know they have said no. I have explained I never felt that and I was mostly wondering about medical history when I reached out. She keeps telling me no, she knows that's not true, we're the same. She tried gifting me an Ancestry DNA thing and everything to help me make contact with them again. I have tried being kind and understanding and suggested she find other adoptees to find someone with her experiences. But she keeps insisting our experiences are the same and our feelings are the same and we should stick together and \"find our real families\" together.I lost my temper with her last week and told her we are NOT the same and she needs to accept that I do not care and do not want to find my birth family and I cannot keep helping her if she won't accept that. I said this after she tried to give me another DNA kit. She is wasting her money and being so pushy and it set me off. She told me we're supposed to have each other's backs as the adoptees of the family.AITA?",

I was woken up to a knocking on the front door 7:20am before my alarm was due to go off 7:30am. I got back into bed after letting the cleaner in and my partner cuddled me from behind asking if I slept OK. Truthfully, I said “no”, he rolled over to the other side and I proceeded to get ready for work. We had some minor interactions throughout and I kissed him goodbye and wished him a good day. He then said “sorry for whatever I did wrong”, confused I said “wdym? you didn’t do anything” he said I was clearly pissed off… I said I wasn’t and asked what he meant. Turns out his perspective is that I shouldn’t just say “no” and that I need to give context such as why I slept badly otherwise i’m just spreading negativity and starting his day shit. I kinda lost it. I’m not really a morning person and had a short fuse… possibly bc of my disturbed sleep. Anyway we argued when I came home and he stood by his point that I can’t start the day badly otherwise it ruins everyone’s day.SO am I the asshole ? I shouldn’t lie and say “it’s fine” when it’s not but also I’m expected to give a detailed report when I’m barely awake, don’t want to talk yet and tbh it feels self-serving. If my partner said he didn’t sleep well, I’d move closer and ask why, I wouldn’t roll away and be annoyed they are spreading negativity. I could be wrong tho. Life is pretty great maybe I should just appreciate more and be thankful I even have a bed, am able to sleep and a job to go to and a cleaner to let in and my answer should for those reasons alone always be “good”.Help me out. It’s pretty minor but we were really arguing about this so perhaps I’m the asshole.

Me (15F), my parents (39M and 40F), and my sister (13F) had stopped at a gas station to find some food and use the restroom.Ill make it known, I already hate public restrooms.  Especially because of how little privacy they allow for. I also have some trauma from when I was younger, as a result I am very private and I get really upset when people intrude on my privacy or my bodily autonomy.So while I was in the restroom stall I was quite honestly HORRIFIED to see sombody looking into the stall and smiling like it was funny. When I realized it was my sister, I didn't know how to respond. It was mostly a mixture of shock, anger, and disbelief.Once I was out of the stall I started to berate her and I asked her what the f*** she was doing. What made her think it was okay to watch someone in the bathroom? What if it wasn't me in the stall? She got upset with me and left to find our parents. I followed her and when I found them, she was already telling our parents how I had cussed at her--I'm not allowed to swear especially at family members--and how I had yelled at her when she tried to tell me to hurry up. Conveniently leaving out the part where she looked into the stall.At first both of my parents were upset with me, and when I explained why I yelled at her, my dad seemed to calm down a bit more. I explained that I thought I was justified to be upset since she was looking into the stall. I asked my parents: \"What kind of a perverted freak looks into somebody's bathroom stall?\" I did say it pretty loud and some people did turn their heads. My mom got really upset and took my sister out to the car while me and my dad stayed in the gas station. My dad told me that what she did was wrong but that I shouldn't have said that, and I agree with him.When we went back out to the car, my mom and sister were still pretty mad at me and my mom told me that she was just a kid, she made a mistake, she's my sister so it shouldn't matter, and that she said sorry so it should be okay.I argued that she was 13 and she should know better. I told her I didn't care that she was my sister, her behavior was disgusting and I wouldn't let my mom try to justify it.My mom calmed down a bit more, she talked to my sister about it.

	"body" : "Hello reddit longtime lurker first time posterI (30F) got into an argument with my cousin(22F),uncle(72M) and aunt(67F) recently over something my cousin  did(or didn’t do).So to give some information my cousin is kind of unreliable,spoiled and seen as the rainbow child in our family.Her parents did have her when they were old and had given up on having kids(They tried in their late 20’s and early 30’s but had 3 miscarriages)She could do no wrong in their eyes (they were pretty well off as well)She could do something that would land her Jail for 30 years to life and they would still come up with an excuse to defend her.She blew her college fund on parties,clothes,jewelry etc..and all her parents did was just give her more money which she blew in a month and told her whatever she thinks is best she does.So Jenna(Fake Name)around a year ago got into making realistic cakes and I must say despite my one-sided Beef with her she is really good at it and even on par with professionals,she could make a living out of it if she settled down.Christmas was coming up and they tasked everyone with something to  do/make from home and just bring the food to the host’s house and just heat it up to make everything easier.Jenna was tasked with bringing the turkey,I clearly knowing she was going to mess it up asked if they’re sure about that,don’t they want to give it to someone more reliable and give Jenna a smaller task or just nothing at all.They all dismissed me and said calm down she’ll come through she won’t screw it up because she knows how important it is.So fast forward to christmas day everyone was arriving to the house but Jenna was a bit late.We facetimed her and she said she was in her car on her way and the turkey is very hot so there would be no need to heat it up.When Jenna arrived she placed the turkey down on the table and called everyone around to show them something.She had a knife her hand and was hovering over the turkey she put the knife through to reveal that it was a realistic cake (It was VERY realistic to be honest).All of our family clapped and said how talented she was.I asked her so where’s the real turkey?She responded with oh I didn’t have time to buy or bake it since my time was spent on the cake.I lost it and said how could you forget one of the major dishes that we need?You screwed up your college fund just like how you screwed up dinner.She began crying and her parents called me an asshole and said I ruined christmas.Half of the family is siding with my uncle and aunts and saying I didn’t have to shout at her while the others are saying i’m in the right.So reddit AITA?",

	"body" : "My brother Brian's two children, Matt (14) and Stacy (16) are really obnoxious towards the other children in the family. Matt is very rowdy and rough when playing with other children whilst Stacy is really mean and critical. With them around, there's almost always a guaranteed crying child at the end of the day. They're basically just bullies and all the other children dread their visit.Me and my other siblings have asked Brian and his wife to address this issue but they always dismissed it as kids being kids everytime. Even his in-laws have at one point brought up that their kids have behavioral issues but alas, they refuse to do anything about it.A few days ago, my son, Luke (13), had his birthday. When we were planning for it, before even asking for gifts, the first thing Luke asked for was to not invite Matt and Stacy. I knew exactly where he was coming from and after a short discussion with my wife, we agreed to respect his wishes. I then informed Brian that his children were not invited as per Luke's request. As expected, he went on a rant about how this was unfair and low because they're just kids but I made it clear that my son was not to blame and that the behavior of his children is the problem. Even some of the other kids we invited declined because they thought Matt and Stacy would be there. The conversation ended with Brian being mad and promising not to invite us or any of my kids to anything. Nevertheless, we still had the birthday despite his attempts to complain about me to other family members.To be honest, I think I merely respected my son's wishes but it does seem a little bit cruel.

To cheer her up, a bunch of us decided to dress up and go to a nice bar. Eden approached a group of guys and started talking to one of them at the bar and he bought us a round of shots, and had them reviewed to our table before we could say anything. I also drank two drinks before that shot so I was nearing tipsy. I am a lightweight so I decided to cut myself off after another drink. Eden insisted on us all staying for another round and I don’t really remember how much I had after that. However, we all left together and I got my boyfriend Ted to pick me up from the station.Today, I told Ted about last night and included the guy who bought us a round and Ted got upset, as accepting the drink made it look like I was ‘available’. I told Ted that I didn’t speak to any of the guys at the bar and he bought the drinks for Eden’s sake, not me. I just want an outside perspective.ETA- When I said I don’t remember how much I had after, I do remember I had two more drinks after the shot but I don’t know how much alcohol was in them as I didn’t order them.

(Also I am one of those persons that forgets everything in one second)One night my sister called me and asked me if I could babysit my niece next week because she had to do something and my niece didn't wanted to go with her because it was boring.As a good sister I accept but I was a bit tired so I say goodbye to my sister, brush my teeths and sleep(My sister asked me to babysit her on Thursday and the call was on Sunday)The next day was a normal day and I totally forgot about my sister and my niece. I go to my grandma's house to help her ect just a normal dayThen the next day my friend calls me and ask me \"Hey girl wanna hang out at my house on Thursday?\" I totally forgot about my sister so I say \"yes\" thinking I had nothing to do that dayOn Thursday my friend come over to my house spend the day and at night we will sleep at her houseDuring the day my sister drops my niece and I remember I have to babysit her, it's not a problem because my friend and my niece know each other so we just watch movies. (My grandma is with us in the house because I live with her)Then comes the night and I take my phone to call my sister to ask her if she could pick up her kid because I had to go. I say very calmly with a soft voice \"Hey sissy I'm sorry I totally forgot I had to babysit her but I have to go right now and I really can't stay can you pick her up? Or I can leave her with grandma they're gonna draw and watch movies waiting for you to come\"My sister starts yelling at me insulting me and calling me names like \"You freaking b! I told you to babysit her for a f-ing reason! You're so stupid! You can't do anything in life you're useless!!!\"I start to cry because I'm very sensitive and my grandma takes the phone saying that there's no need to panic and that she can keep my niece while I'm gone because it will be the last time I see my friend before she goes in vacation in another country.My sister doesn't listen and yells again so I take my friend and go in her mom's car that was waiting for us in front of my house.We had fun me and my friend that night and the next day my mom is a bit mad but it's okay.So yeah AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for refusing to allow my MIL into our home until she apologises for her comments about my past?",
	"body" : "So, I wanted to use a throwaway account for this post.I (27f) made a lot of mistakes when I was younger and at 16, I had a baby daughter. Her father was a lot older and a very bad guy, and was sent away to prison before she had been born. We of course have no contact today. I'm ashamed of my past, and do everything in my power to better myself and provide for my daughter. For example I missed out on my GED when I was younger, so I studied to achieve it later in life and I'm currently part time at college while working.My daughter is 11, healthy and flourishing in school and  I couldn't be prouder of her. Six years ago I met my current husband (27m) and he's just a wonderful human being. He's been nothing but supportive to me and an amazing person to be around my daughter, so much so that after we married two years ago, he formally adopted my daughter.The only problem is his mom. She's very conservative, being a born again Christian, and the interactions we've had together have never been good. I've always been very aware she dislikes me as a result of my past and didnt want my husband to marry me or adopt my girl, but on both sides we were able to be civil enough, to a degree that I imagined she'd just accepted it. My husband doesn't have the best relationship with her either but tries his best, and I've always supported him though that. Even so, I dislike her and I know she hates me.Recently though, she said something really awful. It was during a family meal - she came over with her husband (my husband's stepfather) and we ate alongside my daughter. My MIL kept staring at my daughter to such an extent that she was visibly uncomfortable. I asked her politely why she kept looking at her like that, to which my MIL coldly asked if she looked anything like her father, and whether we could compare her face to his mugshot.Needless to say I was floored, my husband was furious and my daughter actually cried, which made me start bawling too. My MIL smirked and just left with her husband, and from then my husband and I refused her access to our home.This was a month ago. A few family members have started admonishing us for keeping her away as long as we have. My reply is that she hasn't apologised and so we don't want her back, but they're saying we're being cruel and not being understanding of \"her moral values\". She's apparently said she's sorry about what happened, but crucially she hasn't said that to me.Am I being a major AH? Or am I within my rights here?EDIT: I forgot to mention that my MIL has since been badmouthing me to the rest of the family (even more than she did before). She still has not said sorry to me though.",

	"body" : "I (20f) and my friend (Lucy-23f) have been drifting apart recently as she’s become obsessed with tiktok poetry and letting it dictate her life and relationships. The worst part was when she broke up with her boyfriend (Josh-21m) after he didn’t open a pomegranate in a ‘delicate’ way. MF IT’S A POMEGRANITE.She came to me crying about it because Josh had called her deranged and I told her I agree. We didn’t talk like we used to for a few months or so until she told me she’d met someone on a dating app and wanted me to come have a few drinks with them on their first date. I said sure.This guy (Max-20s) seemed so nice. At one point I asked what they were doing after this and he said if all goes well, they'd go back to her place. He then mentioned something about how she'd brought food to make a fruit and cheese plate and that she'd need his artist hands to cut the pomegranate.I said 'oh just so you know, the pomegranate is a test. If you want this to work, you'll be as gentle with the fruit as possible. she broke up with her ex over this test.' He looked at me like I had 2 heads and asked if I was serious. I said yes. He said he knew she liked poetry and all that but didn't know she was that intense about it.When she got back, everything went well until it was time for them to leave.Lucy called me a few hours later asking me what I said to Max. Apparently as he was cutting the fruit, he accidently squished a grape and said 'oops, hope you don't break up with me haha' and it caused an argument where he told Lucy I had warned him about the 'test'. We got into an argument and I said 'Lucy, if you want to base your relationships on shitty tiktok poetry, go ahead but you will be hard pressed to find someone who fits all your weird expectations.'She hung up and text me some long paragraph about her past relationships and how this poetry is giving her boundaries, etc and that I'm a bad friend for making fun of her. I have never made fun of her, just pointed out that real life isn't poetry.AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for not liking the gifts my bf got me?",
	"body" : "I (21f) received gifts from my boyfriend (24m) today as my christmas present. I kinda knew from the start before I even opened them, that I wouldn’t like them. I just had that feeling. Turns out that feeling was right.He got me two gifts. One gift was a giant life size cutout of Hatsune Miku and the other was a makeup palette.The first gift just kinda blew my mind. I’ve never once hinted that this would be something i’m interested in, nor have I ever directly mentioned/said anything about liking the character. This gift was based off a poster I had in my old apartment that my ex left when he moved out. He was the fan of the character and I was just left with a poster I had bought for him. When we left my parents, I told him that I wasn’t very fond of it because I think cutouts are creepy and I didn’t want to set up and get scared by it randomly in the middle of the night. He kinda got upset by this even though i did thank him for it.The second gift was alright but when it comes to makeup, I’m very picky about the stuff I use. I’m into more pinks and bright colors then the more tone down colors that the palette had. This was also another thing I didn’t specifically mentioned I wanted. I didn’t say anything about not liking it and just thanked him.It feels like He assumed i would enjoy this stuff when I don’t. I don’t wear makeup often and I’m not fond or random things that could freak me out by just being in the corner all freaky like. I texted my friend to ask her opinion on this and he caught a glimpse of my telling her about the presents and how I didn’t like them. He told me he’s upset I went t to her instead of telling him but I already felt bad for telling him that I didn’t really like the first thing, so saying I didn’t the second one just seemed like a dick move and I was just gonna keep it to myself.Now he’s just giving me the silent treatment even after I explained that I felt shitty telling him I didn’t like the things he bought me. I know i should be grateful but I went to lengths for his gift and it feels like he didn’t listen to anything I’ve been saying I’ve wanted in the 3 months i’ve been talking about random stuff i would like.AITA?Edit:To answer some things:What did I get him? I got him a $100 gift certificate to his favorite tattoo artist because he has a tattoo he’s been wanting to get finished. I would have put more on it if I had the money but I’m flat broke right now due to house bills.That stupid poster: That poster was something I had in my old apartment untilAugust of this year. It was hidden behind my door of the bedroom of the apartment. I no longer live in that apartment. He watched me tear the poster to shreds when I was moving things out because he was one of the people helping me move out of that apartment because that apartment was where my ex boyfriend ( the owner of the poster) abused me.The gifts: I never once said I didn’t thank him for them. I did, I told him thank you for the gifts when I opened them and told him privately after the first gift the story behind why i’m not a fan of Miku. He was upset by this but understood. I told him how I was a little scared to open the second one because I didn’t want to not like it and make him feel bad if I didn’t. He told me that he “bet his life” I would like it. When It turned out I didn’t like it, I messaged my friend back because she was asking about the second gift because I sent her a photo of the first one. He just happened to look at my phone when I was distracted and saw the conversation and got mad.You live with your bf of 3 months??? I have a house which I bought in August and had ask my bf( who was my friend at the time) to be my roommate to make it easier to pay bills. He ended up asking me out in September. Yes we live together, but no it wasn’t because we were dating. We were close friends (even if we had only met a couple months prior) and I need someone to help pay bills. I had another that was gonna move in but she backed out because she wanted her own space with her boyfriend.Edit 2:I can’t get to everyone, though from what i’ve read (which is a lot, I didn’t expect this to blow up) Majority is that I’m NTA.For those that think I am entitled and ungrateful, that’s to each their own. I told him specifically not to get me anything at all because I wasn’t able to afford much. I was only able to get his gift out of sheer luck! I didn’t want anything but I knew he was going to get me something no matter what I said, so whenever I saw something I liked either while we were out or if I saw it online, I’d send it to him or point it it out saying this is something I think is cool.I never ever mentioned Miku in any conversation ever. I have however mentioned other anime characters that I enjoy! I’ve talked about countless things I enjoy with him. He knows how much of a fan of Hello Kitty I mean he bought me socks randomly because I was sad about something. That’s something I would of appreciated as a cardboard cutout (even though they are still creepy) I’ve also mentioned that I need a makeup container so I could move my makeup off the floor of the bathroom. I never ask for makeup because i’m picky about my makeup because I have sensitive skin.I hope this edit helps people understand better!  I did text him this morning after I had left for work that I was sorry for hurting him by and that it wasn’t intentional. I also explained why I didn’t like the gifts and told him I’d make him his favorite food to make up for upsetting him.",

	"body" : "I (f21) have three older brothers. My brother (m32) is married. His wife is 30Both of our parents are lawyers, mom was still working full time when my brothers were born/ they were little. Then they had me and my mom (who always wanted a girl) decided to switch to SAHM and later on she started working part time when I started school. I think I was a little bit more \"sheltered\" than my brothers, but I think that's just because I'm a girl and not because our parents love me more? I've seen it with my friends' parents as well.I am also married and I'm a SAHM too, my husband and I have a four month old baby boy.Well, now the conflict. This happened last week at my nephew's birthday party.  At one point, I asked everyone if they minded if I nursed my baby there or if I could go to one of the bedrooms to do it. Everyone was fine with it, so I just followed through and we continued talking. I'm only breastfeeding my son, I don't pump milk or give him formula.My sister in law asked me about it, I told her that I just prefer to do it like this, my son's pediatrician says that he's healthy and doesn't need formula, so I like breastfeeding.Well, my SIL thought that it was \"very offensive\" how I said that I liked it because it sounded as if I don't understand my privilege for being able to do it. She said \"of course you like it because you don't do anything else all day than have your kid in your arms and breast\". I feel like that came out of nowhere honestly and I asked her why she was saying that. She told me that she's tired of hearing me talk about how wonderful motherhood is because I'm just a glorified housewife and I talk like being a mother is the easiest thing in the world, just because I don't work and I don't do most of the house work.I told her that every time I talk about motherhood, I do it from my perspective. It's not my fault that other women don't enjoy it as much as I do, I am giving my opinion and that's all.Well, then she started calling me out on my \"privileges\" and said that I'm just a \"silly girl who doesn't understand the world\". I got angry and replied to her, so on top of what my SIL was saying, my brother started telling me to stop with that spoiled brat attitude and that I need to face the real world and he insisted on how privileged and spoiled I am (by our parents and my husband)My husband intervened, my brother and him argued too. My parents also tried to say that SIL's attack was uncalled for. My husband and I left, so did my parents. Well about half an hour after I left I received a text from my brother saying that everyone was uncomfortable and some people have left his son's birthday party because I \"can't take criticism\". He also said that my nephew is \"severely upset\" with me.My husband and parents are very obviously on my side, so are my friends although one of them told me that maybe my SIL is stressed out because of her job and taking care of her children and as another mother I should be more understanding.",

	"body" : "When I (28F) was 19, I got pregnant from a one night stand. The father, “Aiden” wanted to be around and was supportive from the start. We never got together but we became very close friends. Unfortunately, when I was 8 months pregnant, Aiden died in a car accident. It devastated me, as well as his family. To this day, it haunts me that he was never able to meet our son, “Brady”.Aiden’s family has been heavily involved in Brady’s life since the beginning. Birthday parties, celebrations, etc. They always made me feel welcome. I started dating again when Brady was 2 and his parents, “Michelle and Dan” actually encouraged me too. They said I deserved to be happy. They even watched Brady occasionally so I could go on dates. Brady has always been told about his dad.When Brady was 4, I met “Justin” (now 31). It took 6 months for him to meet Brady and from the start, they bonded quickly. A couple of months later and Justin met Aiden’s family. They loved him. I was always clear with Justin that their family would always be in our lives, especially for Brady’s benefit. He agreed it was the best.I married Justin 2 years later. Brady began calling him “papa” on his own. He still talked about Aiden and called him “daddy”. I kept all pictures of Aiden up. Brady proudly said he had 2 dads. Michelle and Dan seemed fine. A year later, Justin brought up adopting Brady and I agreed.That’s when Dan and Michelle began to show their displeasure. I explained that we’d never stop Brady from seeing them, we’d always talk about Aiden, show pictures, etc. We also planned on hyphenating their last name with Justin’s. Dan and Michelle argued with me. I tried to keep things calm for Brady’s sake. But then Michelle and Dan tried to stop the adoption. It didn’t work and the adoption went through. But because of their contesting, it took longer and only went through last year. It also added extra court fees.Dan and Michelle have since accepted things, though I still won’t leave them alone with Brady in case they try to trash Justin again. Justin is fine with them coming around for Brady and is cordial, but definitely keeps a wall up. He’s not overly friendly like he once was. He’ll smile, hype them up for Brady but that’s it. He says he’s upset with what they put all of us through, especially the emotional toll it put on me.Dan and Michelle came by Christmas Eve to see Brady. Justin was once again polite but didn’t say much. A few days later, Michelle told me she’s hurt Justin’s stopped making an effort. I told her she can’t expect him to be the same after all they did and said in court. She said they apologized and he accepted it. I said yes but actions have consequences and they need to accept it.Dan told me that I was insensitive to not take Michelle’s side after all they’ve done. Their daughter (Brady’s aunt) tells me Justin and I are in the right. I don’t know what to think and feel stretched between everyone. AITA?EDIT: Some have asked what was said in court…They said he’d be an unfit father, despite him having a job and a loving relationship with Brady. They also said that Justin was just after Brady’s trust fund. For some context, Aiden was killed in a drunk driving accident. I took the driver to court and sued them for the damages of me having to be a single parent due to their negligence. All the money was put into a trust for Brady that he can’t touch until he’s 25. The overseer is also Aiden’s sister so it’s not like she’d ever agree to sign it over to Justin.Justin has never shown interest and has money of his own. The judge threw it out for those reasons.They called Justin a variety of names in court and tried to demean his character, calling him a child stealer, etc. This came after years of claiming they loved him and thought he was perfect for me, which Aiden’s sister testified in court. They later admitted to me that they made all this up to try to stop the adoption and they never believed it.",

	"body" : "So my friendship group is currently in shambles over this situation so I’m looking for some outside opinions.The two main people are my (24F) friends Alex (25M) and Lia (24F). They hooked up and now Lia is pregnant but Alex isn’t happy about it. Alex and Lia have always been weirdly close but they’ve never crossed the friendship line and clearly for good reason because the whole thing has been messy as hell since Lia told him she was pregnant. He asked her to get rid of it and she said no, so he asked her not to tell his family about the baby yet but she went ahead and told them.The majority of our friendship group thinks she baby trapped him for money since her family don’t have much and Alex’s are more than comfortable. I originally was defending her but then while she was ranting to me about what a jackass Alex is, she said the only thing Alex would be good for was money and that her baby wouldn’t need him as a father. She kept talking about Alex, money and him being an ATM for a good 30 minutes.The conversation left a bad taste in my mouth so I was discussing it with Charlotte, my best friend and Alex’s ex, and we both agreed that it seems like Lia only cares about the money and I said I was starting to agree with the friends who think she baby trapped him for money. Unfortunately, Charlotte mentioned it to a few other friends who told others and it’s gotten back to Lia. She hasn’t said a single thing to me and the only reason I know she now hates me is because Alex, of all people, confronted me about it and she blocked me.He told me to leave Lia alone and tried to guilt me because she’s pregnant and needs her friends right now but he’s the one causing her the most stress. He said if I (or anyone else) said anything else about her we’d have to deal with him so most people are now denying ever saying she baby trapped him so I feel like I’m being thrown under the bus here. Charlotte said he’s only playing hero because his family are all on his case now because Lia keeps running to them so he has no choice but to act like he cares.AITA?",

Leading up to it I was thinking of how I was gonna act when she tells me but when it actually came to it I decided to just tell her I already knew instead of lying and pretending to act surprised. Both her and my parents were pretty shocked and asked how I knew and I told them I had heard them talking about it. I felt kinda bad because they were probably expecting a big reaction but I thought it was better than lying to them.My mom was pretty pissed off and later that night she went mad at me for \"ruining a special moment\". I told her I just didn’t want to fake a reaction but she said she didn’t care and that I could’ve just pretended to be surprised and happy for her.Edit: I wasn’t there when my parents initially found so for everyone saying they were mad, idk how they reacted",

	"body" : "I (23F) have been dating Noah (25M) for more than 3 years now. We met through friends, he's truly the loml.Admittedly, my parents never liked him because I was only 19 while he was 22. I admit, this is natural and we gave them plenty of time to trust him. They also wanted me to marry someone more 'polished' (the word they used). Noah is not catholic nor is he from a 'wealthy' background. He also has tattoos, which is a pretty big sin for my family. I knew my family was pretentious like that, but I never thought they'll berate me for choosing my own life partner. Noah is more successful than me and he takes care of me more than anyone else.My brother used to tell me that my parents thought I was going through my 'rebel' phase later in life because I never used to go against their wishes before. This is true, but I've explained to them that its because I didn't know I had a choice. They thought I'll breakup with him eventually.A few months ago I found out that I'm pregnant. It was not planned at all. But Noah and I used to talk about family way before this, so even thought things are happening a lot earlier than we planned, we wanted to go ahead with it. Soon after, Noah proposed as well. We hosted a dinner for both our families and told them the news and this is where things got out of control.I didn't want to shock them, so my brother had also told them that I was engaged, but I wanted to tell them about the pregnancy face to face. I don't get to see them much since they live far away and this was special to me. But this is one of the reasons I feel like I'm the AH, I feel like maybe I put too much pressure? Anyways, they came, they saw the ring, and pretended to be okay with it. But after we got started eating they were continuously making snide remarks. Like how Noah could afford such a ring, or that its fake. Now, Noah is not a person to take shit, and after a a lot comments, he told them that if they had the class they showed with their money (my name) wouldn't have to be scared of telling them she's pregnantTo say they were shocked is in an understatement. My mom started crying, my dad started fighting with my MIL about Noah trapping me. I was so stressed and scared, they just kept shouting, Noah told them to get out, but before leaving my mother told me to \"get ride of it\"I couldn't believe what she said. I still didn't say anything. I was shocked. The next day when they called I told them they were uninvited from the wedding. They were okay even said they were free of a burden.But after a week they called, apologised, and said that missing their only daughter's wedding would be devastating but I shouted a lot that day. I called them names and I just lost itIt's been a while, no contact. I overthink a lot nowadays, hormones I guess, but I want to know. What if I explained the pregnancy before they got shocked, maybe if I told them instead of Noah, idk. They have given me everything my entire life, my education, everything. AITA?",

	"body" : "I honestly can’t tell if I’m over reacting or not but here goes. I have two kids (girl - 7, boy - 9) and recently I’ve started introducing them to my boyfriend’s parents. Now, boyfriend’s dad has no filter. There is nothing he will not say. They were over at our house yesterday and we were sitting at the kitchen table with my daughter before we left to go to a restaurant for dinner.He was saying the most vile things. Terribly racist, homophobic, sexist jokes. Every swear word you can imagine, the N word, all of it. Boyfriend is laughing, swearing, going along with it. I end up taking my daughter out of the room and keeping her busy until we go out to eat.We get to the restaurant. He openly mocks my 9 year old son, tells him he’s a girl because he has long hair, and because he’s a girl does he wear a training bra. Makes jokes about my daughter playing hockey and how girls can’t play sports. Everyone is laughing except me, my son, and daughter. I’m desperately making comments to try and diffuse.  At one point he asks me to describe how tight the ass was of a woman who I had been referencing in a story… on and on with this stuff.I get home and I can’t sleep all night. I’m so mad at myself for not calling it out, for not saying something while it was happening. I texted my Bf, I said going forward I’m gonna keep the kids out of his families stuff, it’s not my style, I don’t want the kids around it… whatever. A huge fight follows, he says it’s just the way he is, that he has good intentions, he doesn’t mean anything by it. He says it’s my responsibility to teach the kids that different people exist, that they need to learn that that’s how some people are and that’s the way it is. I say no, it’s my job to protect my kids now, to show my daughter that she doesn’t need to tolerate “old creepy men” that say offensive things just to avoid making people uncomfortable. That my son shouldn’t have to put up with a grown man marking jokes at his expense and have adults laugh at him when he can’t defend himself.I ask him why he isn’t as mad as I am that his dad is saying that stuff so freely around kids. Why isn’t he angry that his dad is making horrible sexual comments to his son’s girlfriend. I say that any adult that says such vile things so freely around small children is a piece of shit. I know that it’s hard for my boyfriend to feel like I’m attacking his dad, but it makes me so angry and I really think he is a disgusting man.I’m very open to advice and opinions. We are on the verge of breaking up over this!Edit to add: I’m quite literally reading every single comment and it’s making me emotional to have so much validation that I was right in setting this boundary.  I’m pulling pieces from each response and it makes me feel so confident in what I’ve done, and how I can move forward in conversations with my kids about what happened and how I’m going to fix things with them.I’m in a good position. I own my house and it’s just me and the kids. Boyfriend lives on his own and only sleeps over when the kids are at their dads. I have no problem leaving a bad relationship behind me, I think I was convincing myself that I was over reacting and crazy. Thanks to these comments I know that I’m not.",

He got angry since he really wanted to use the name of the person who meant so much to him, but I refused.

	"title" : "AITA for letting my baby cry when she was hungry because we were stuck in traffic?",
	"body" : "My husband and I were on a recent road trip with our 2 kids under 2. We drove through a winter storm during the first few hours of our drive on the second day. The storm created icy road conditions, periods of poor visibility, and eventually an accident that led to us sitting in stop and go traffic for quite some time. My husband has done a lot of driving in his life, but does make me nervous because he’s a distracted driver and uses his phone while driving. This means sometimes I see things up ahead before he does and he hits the brakes harder or more suddenly than if he hadn’t been distracted.While we were sitting in traffic, both kids started crying. This is typical for sitting in traffic - they’re happier in the car while we’re moving. It was also about the time that our 4-month old should be starting to get hungry. I started trying to distract/entertain the kids to keep them happy. My husband mentioned a couple times that I should just take our youngest out of her car seat and feed her. We were only going a few miles/hour in stop and go traffic, on an icy road, surrounded by semi trucks. There was an exit coming up that would take about 10 minutes to get to, and I decided I’d wait until we could get off the freeway and pull over. By the time we got to the exit, traffic had started to pick up again, we were going 40mph, and our youngest wasn’t crying anymore, so my husband kept driving. A few minutes later we were in stop and go again and she was crying again. He ended up angrily pulling over and feeding her himself (at that point he wouldn’t let me, and I was worried if I was feeding her he’d keep driving again anyway).He maintains that I was being “psycho” and “neglectful” for not wanting to get her out of her car seat when we were driving “as fast as I can walk” while she was clearly hungry. I feel that traffic can pick back up unexpectedly and we were in conditions that didn’t feel safe, even if we were going so slowly.AITA for not getting my daughter out of her seat in stop and go traffic to feed her when she was clearly hungry?EDIT: I did try feeding her in her car seat first, but since there isn’t room between the car seats for me to sit and buckle up, this was also unsafe as I was then unbuckled. She wouldn’t take the bottle in her seat anyway.Thank you for the replies. If anything, this has given me the very necessary reminder that I need to do something about his distracted driving in the instances that I can control it, despite how he reacts, including being the only driver myself if necessary.",

I personally never liked the boy’s behavior he was a bit rude but I never interfered with him and let his father talk with him whenever something bad happened.However, some months ago I caught him peeking into my undergarments stuff , mind you he is a 16 yrs old now and we never had the mother-son bond that would justify such an act. He begged me not to expose him to his father and I agreed. I agreed and warned him about. Another day, he was at the house after his school and I saw him hurriedly getting out of the bedroom I then entered to see what he was doing and found that my undergarments drawer wasn’t closed properly, I opened it and noticed that 2 ofmy bras were missing. I went and opened his school bag saw the stolen bras and confronted him about it then while we were fighting his father arrived and learned about everything.All that happened 5 months ago and the boy was restricted from coming into the house without his father’s presence and his father also took away his keys.

The 12 year old got really sick on the 23rd.. the eve of Christmas eve.  103.8 fever, aches, tummy hurt... he just felt lousy.  I put him to bed and he stayed there all day on the 24th.  By that night, he still was very sick.  Normally we open family presents on Christmas Eve, but we decided to wait.My 12 year old is at that age where I don't think he believes, but he WANTS to so after I put him to bed, Santa came and we all crossed our fingers there would be a Christmas miracle and he would feel better.By Christmas morning, when we normally open Santa presents, he really tried to get up - he took a shower, said he was well enough to go down and see what Santa brought, but took one look at the presents, turned right around and went back upstairs and crawled into bed.  I said we would wait to open gifts until he was better, but one of my teens had an attitude about it all day and tonight my husband said he felt bad that we made the kids wait to open their gifts.   Now I'm second-guessing everything.  I thought it would be cruel to let the kids open their gifts while their little brother was sick upstairs but tonight my husband said we should have let them open their gifts. I suppose I could have picked out a couple of gifts for them to open, but I have no idea which gifts are which... Santa wraps everything in red paper and many of the packages look similar.  Even though they have the kids names on them, I have no idea which gifts are which, so it's hard to pick out a couple... I didn't want one kid to open a pair of socks and another kid to open their \"big\" gift.Tonight, my 12 year old seems to be improving a bit - his fever now around 102 but he stayed in bed sleeping all day and I'm just really hoping he's MUCH better tomorrow, the 26th.I didn't think I was asking too much for making the kids wait, it's not like I'll make them wait for days and days but my husband now thinks that making them wait was wrong.  Maybe it was.EDITED TO ADD - I've gotten lots of the same questions:YES I have been in contact with his doctor all alongYES my husband was involved in the decision to delay gifts. He had a change of heart later.My 12 year old probably doesn't believe in Santa but doesn't want the magic to end. This wasn't a question of AITA because my kid likes the idea of Santa.Yes I do have a LOT of red wrapping paper and I wrap the presents so that they all look similar. That is how Santa did it when I grew up.We did not \"cancel\" Christmas, just delayed presents.  We did special things with the older kids.My decision would have been the same no matter what kid was sick.My plan was never to make them wait forever. By Christmas night the big kids knew they would get their gifts the 26th either way. We opened this morning and all is well.  Fever broke last night and today (the 26th) the 12 year old is slowly feeling better. Merry Christmas, I appreciate the perspective!",

I told her that, and she looked upset. She said I could have told her while she was making the eggs. I said I was sorry, I forgot.

So I saw she was making eggs but didn’t notice what kind; she didn’t ask me how I’d like them and I also didn’t remember to ask.

Last year I've moved out on my own and in the same year I got married to my wife. Because of the rapid shift in life and work becoming more busy then ever, I haven't had the time or energy to make time for that part of my family. Recently I made time to invite my niece over. No plans, just for her to come over and hang out with my wife and I. After picking her up on the way home she talked about wanting to build a snow man and a bunch of other things we thought would be fun. After getting home my wife says that while Niece and I go out to play in the snow she'll finish some chores around the house. Before going out Niece sees my Vr headset and shows interest so I offer to let her play it before going outside. She says yes, so.i start it up and she starts playing. 5 minutes pass and my wife comes into the room and asks why we aren't outside yet. I tell her that Niece wanted to play VR first so I let her. Wife gets upset, saying video games isn't quality time. I respond with \"we're spending time together and niece is having fun, so why does it matter?\" Wife storms off. Soon after niece and I do go out and make a couple of snowmen and snow angles, ect. And after playing in the snow for 30ish minutes, Niece asks to play vr again. I say yes and she skips away to play vr in the living room. We switch back and forth trying to beat each others score in Beat Saber and stuff like that.Fast forward. I drop Niece back off at home and come back home and my wife has a list made out for me when I walk back into the door. It's a list of things that our young guests aren't allowed to do while at our house. And on the list is no playing video games amongst other seemingly arbitrary prohibitions. I say \" The list is not necessary, because when I bring my family or friends over I'm going to do what we enjoy.\" She says \"that's no way to spend time with kids, doing nothing but playing video games. I like doing crafts and playing board games and other things with my siblings when they come over, why can't you do the same?\" I respond \"because we weren't raised don't those things so i didn't think to do those things, but if you offered to try some of that stuff when she was still here I would've obliged. But I'm not going to accept a list of prohibitions because you don't like our version of fun.\" The argument escalated and I maybe sorta said some mean things like \"you're too narrow minded and dull to accept that things other than what you like are fun\"Tl;DR Wife imposed rules for what activities I'm not allowed to do with my nieces when they come over.

	"body" : "Before I start, I want to say thank you for all the advice from my previous post.I decided to take Reddit’s advice and talked to them one more time about the situation.I called my parents and let them know that we love them and we really want to be there for Christmas. Being so far from my family during my entire pregnancy was really difficult and I had been looking forward to this trip for a long time. I explained again that I know it’s not my room anymore, but if THEY want us to travel cross country with an infant to visit, then they need to make at least a small attempt to make the home baby friendly. Our baby can’t crawl yet, so they wouldn’t even need to baby proof. All we asked for was a reasonable space for the baby and us to sleep in. They cut in saying they have a room for us but we decided it was not good enough. I asked them if they would feel comfortable with me sending pictures of the room to our extended family as an explanation for our absence. They said “no” because it’s inappropriate to air out our business. We ended the call by saying all we need is for them to clear out some floor space to make the room more livable.The next day I got a picture from my mom of the room. They tidied it up. It was still a bit cramped, but it was usable. From the room they removed a old TV , a swamp cooler, a big stack of of paperwork from the floor, a broken printer, a broken clock, a stack of clothes, the desk chair, extra blankets and pillows that don’t fit in the linen closet, the broken bunk bed ladder, and a large broken picture frame. All of these things were previously either on the top bed bunk, or on the floor. With all this “junk” removed it was actually possible to walk into the roomI thanked my mom and told her that since we had not officially canceled our flight tickets, we would love to still attend Christmas.My parents are not used to being called out, so whenever it does happen (usually by me) they get defensive but then they later change their attitude and act better. The lack of an apology didn’t really bother me since they adjusted their behavior. They never addressed the room situation, but they cleaned it up and went above and beyond during our visit to make us feel welcome. I guess they just needed some time to think about it.The trip itself was great. The closet and dresser drawers were still crammed with junk, but that didn’t matter since we were just living out of our suitcases during our trip. My extended family got to meet my son. There hasn’t been a baby in my side of the family for 20 years, so my son got lots of love and attention. He also had the chance to play in the sand and put his toes in the water of the beaches I grew up in.TLDR; room was cleaned, we visited for Christmas, trip went well.",

This morning she informed me that she is getting married to a man she met 2 weeks ago. The wedding is scheduled 2 weeks from now, when they will have known eachother for a month total. I have never met this man and neither have her parents or any of her siblings. They also plan to conceive as soon as biology allows after the wedding. Only 2-3 days of the 2 weeks they have known each other, they have actually seen eachother in person.I advised her that, as her best friend, it is my job to tell her when I think she is making a mistake. I begged her to give it some time before she marries him, because if he is really the right person, it won't change between now and 6 months to a year from now.  I told her that she has NO IDEA what he will be like as a partner after only 2 weeks. She doesnt know anything about his finances, his decision making, how he would support her emotionally, etc etc. She refuses to listen and insists on going through with the wedding.  I told her that I cannot stand next to her as her MOH during a wedding I don't support. I might be TA because she really wants me to be there. I am really close with her family as well, so if they support this (which I doubt, but she hasn't even told them yet), they will want me there as well. She is a grown adult and I cant tell her what to do, but I cant stand there and watch her do this.AITA for refusing MOH and WIBTA for not attending at all?",

	"body" : "LAST EDIT: Thanks for all the comments. I'm bowing out of the convo, though, as some people apparently have no reading comprehension and are unable to understand that:We do go on his hiking vacations multiple times a year. Hiking is literally the only vacation he will choose, so there is no \"compromising\" on different locations.He has no trauma with the beach, he just doesn't think it's fun.I never badmouth him in front of our children.I have no control over the location of this particular vacation.He has only went with us once in 10 years. I don't mind him skipping some, but every once in a while would be nice.Thank you all. Have a nice day.Background:I (37f) and husband (37m) have been married for 10 years and have 3 children. Every summer, my family takes a vacation to the beach. I'm not a huge beach fan, but our kids LOVE it, plus my mom pays for me and my siblings and our families, so it's almost a free trip (excluding travel there, which usually isn't a huge cost). Some years only some of my family makes it, but a few years ago my entire family (50+ people) went as a last trip with my grandma. Husband HATES the beach, but reluctantly went with us.His behavior was HORRENDOUS. He wouldn't leave the condo, bailed on previously booked activities that made the cost go up for others, and didn't help AT ALL with our kids. It was basically like he wasn't there, and when he was, he was complaining the whole time. I was so embarrassed. My whole family gave me the pitying stares the whole time and tried to help me as best they could, but it was just a miserable time. Our daughters begged him to play on the beach with them and he just wouldn't engage at all.Since then, he hasn't accompanied us back. In fact, he will only go on vacations with us if it is a place of his choosing. Which is usually hiking. Don't get me wrong, I like to hike, but I'd also like to do other things. And so would the kids.Now on to the part where I called him selfish.We are now planning our trip for this summer to the beach, and once again, he says he will not go. The kids are devastated again, because they want him to go so they can swim together and build sandcastles together. He says he just hates the beach and there's no changing his mind.I got frustrated and called him selfish because he never wants to do anything that the kids enjoy. He said I was being a jerk and there's nothing I can do that will make him like the beach. I told him it's not about liking the beach, it's about spending time with his family. He says we could skip it and go hiking instead if we want to spend time together. So I said we won't be going on anymore of his vacations.Now I feel guilty, since that was the one thing he would do with us. AITA?EDIT: I'm not going to deny my kids the yearly beach vacation. They look forward to it all year long. But they are quite literally the only ones there without their dad present, and they've noticed.EDIT 2: My whole extended family does not go every year. We don't spend the entire time together. There is plenty of downtime and time to be alone. I have suggested new places before and been vetoed. His family has also wanted to do a beach trip (they love the beach) but he refuses. Also, he has no trauma. He just hates the heat and sand and says it's boring.EDIT 3: We do go on smaller hiking trips throughout the year. Every other year, we take a long hiking trip in addition to the beach trip. We can only do that every other year as it isn't a free vacation. He has plenty of vacay time, so that's not an issue. He gets along with my side of the family. Also, in 10 years, he has only gone once. I didn't mind before kids, but I'd like him to go every once in a while with us. I do not expect every year.",

	"body" : "IN THE UK, HORSES ARE VERY COMMON, AND THEY HAVE SEPARATE TRAILS WHERE THEY HAVE RIGHT OF WAY. ALL UK RESIDENTS ARE TAUGHT ABOUT THE RIGHT OF WAY OF THE HORSE INTHEIR DRIVING TESTS.  to be clear, I lived in the US, and some of the rules were different, I just wanted to make it clear that in my country I was legally in the right.**Important edit** there was a path for bikes and walkers only adjacent and we are in an area where horses are very common and most people know to avoid them and ask to interact with themPretty much the title, I (15f) own several horses and train horses that have never been handled to be ridden and have been riding for 10 years now. My pony is Prince, a 5-year-old Connemara. Prince is not a rescue, we bought him last year, he is young and scared of bicycles - he snorts and prances but as long as they aren't too loud or close enough to touch he doesn't buck or kick. I always talk to the bikes if they are coming too close. I normally do this by calling \"Excuse me, can you slow down, he's scared of bikes.\", but I often don't need to.I was riding him down one of my favorite trails that is about 2 meters wide. I meet a bike on here about 1 every time I go down there. He has never misbehaved, and I think it helps desensitize him. However, that day (a rainy Sunday when it would normally be deserted) there were around 30 13-14-year-olds on bikes with headphones in, so they could not hear me. By the time I realized there were more than normal, I could not turn around because he gets far more upset when they come from behind. I pulled him off the path and walked him along the thin grass verge to try and get him as far from them as possible. I did consider dismounting but he tends to get more agitated and less easy to control on the ground. By the time most of them had passed, I had to pull him back onto the path because there were dense trees on either side. At that point, he spotted an abandoned shopping trolley, and I let him look at it and move past at his own speed, as the path was empty apart from a family about 20m behind us just entering the tree area and blocking us in.Enter Darren. He was cycling toward us, and I could feel an already anxious Prince approach boiling point, and I asked him to slow down or possibly dismount his bike. He didn't, if anything he sped up and said \"Why?\". I said, quite loudly because he was getting close \"He's really scared of bikes!\" And Darren said \"How is that my problem?\" in a really passive aggressive voice. I completely lost it, I yelled \"It becomes your problem when he kicks you and puts you in hospital and breaks your bike and you have to pay because you broke the highway code!\" The dad from the family behind me starts saying \"just stop man.\" and Prince is starting to rear and I'm concerned for his safety and mine because the path is concrete so a push him as far into the trees as he will go while Darren cycles merrily on his way while swearing at me. He also nearly cycled into the stroller of the family behind on purpose so the mum had to jump out the way. It took me ages to calm Prince down, and it has majorly set us back in training.My dad says that I shouldn't have yelled at him.AITA?Also I'm in the UK where the Highway code says 2 or more meters between any vehicle and a horse. I was wearing lots of Hi-vis. I couldn't exit the trail because Prince wasn't listening and the family was blocking us.Edit: Just to be clear, it was a bridleway which is designated for horses but walkers and bikers are allowed too. And Darren was around 40 I would guess, so not a kid.",

I also have a 24M brother, but he is overseas right now and doesn’t come into play here.We had our family Christmas recently, and my sister Maddie came with Wes. She is currently six months pregnant with her first child. She gathered everyone around and announced that they’d found out the gender and it was going to be a girl! Everyone was excited and of course got on the topic of baby names.My grandma was sharing some family names she thought might be good (I liked most of them tbh, they were nothing crazy), and then a few relatives jumped in to share their ideas. Maddie said she didn’t need ideas because they’d already picked a name. They will name her Fancy Louise LASTNAME.My mom asked why, and Maddie said they wanted an homage to classic country music, and it would’ve been Cash or Henry “Hank” if it were a boy. My mom said it was a cute name and that represented who they are as a couple (they met because Wes plays in a country cover band at the place where Maddie used to work). I cleared my throat and pointed out that Fancy is not a kid appropriate reference at all. I pulled out my phone and started reading a list of country inspired names that she might want to choose instead.Maddie was very icy to me and went to sit in her car. My mom asked me to apologize or separate myself from the situation, as Wes was starting to get really pissed and agitated that I’d upset Maddie. I went up to my room (I’m in college, so currently staying with my mom) and just ended up playing video games for the rest of the night.Now, a few days have passed and my mom is encouraging me to text Maddie and apologize, as she thinks I shouldn’t have shared my opinion of the name without being asked. I’m open to being told I’m the AH, but I truly think it’s okay to point out when a baby name idea might have inappropriate associations.AITA?EDIT: oops, I should have been clearer about the reference and why it concerns me.

	"body" : "Throwaway because my husband knows my reddit and frequents this sub. Although I'm pretty sure he'll be able to tell it's me because this is a super unique experience, but I'm banking on him not seeing this.My husband, Ethan (27m) and I (27f) got married a year ago. We had been dating since we were 23 and got married last year. We knew that we wanted to have a family, and want multiple kids. So, a few months after we got married we started trying for our first baby. I got pregnant, and I'm about 24wks along today!!At my 20wk appointment, they asked if we wanted to know the gender. We wanted to know so we could start planning names ahead of time. Turns out, it's a girl! I was overjoyed. The next day, we starting talking names and Ethan said that he already knew the PERFECT name for a girl- Zoe.Here is where the issue begins: Zoe is the name of my husband's cat that passed away when we first started dating. Not only that, but the cat was a gift from an ex-girlfriend that they intended on taking care of together. When they broke up, they had \"joint custody\" until she died.I gently let him know that I don't really want to name our daughter after his dead cat. He told me to think about it- reasoning that it fit our criteria (short names, bully-proof, cute, unique so that nobody else in her class will have it, but not so unique that people won't know how to pronounce it,) and he considered cat-Zoe like a daughter to him. I jokingly responded, \"So you want to name our baby after your kid from your last marriage?\"He didn't laugh. Instead, he got defensive. He said it wasn't like that. I said that I didn't really like the idea of naming our daughter after something that he associated with his last relationship. He started getting teary-eyed, presumably because he was thinking about his dead pet. He then responded with \"Fine, it's your baby. Name it whatever you want.\"Since then I've been here and there suggesting names I see elsewhere, and every time he responds with \"I don't care. Do what you want.\"I can't help but feel like the AH; maybe I'm being too stubborn? I do like the name Zoe, it's just that I don't think I'd be able to move past the history behind it.AITA?EDIT: You guys get bonus points if you suggest good baby names!!!EDIT 2: for everyone suggesting the name Chloe instead, that’s the name of my estranged sister that’s in jail hahaha so I’m gonna have to say no to that one !!!UPDATE: thank you all for your kind words and advice! I talked it out with him. I did what many of you told me to do and expressed to him how it made me feel- having our baby associated with something tied to his ex. I even tried to meet him halfway by offering to get the baby a stuffie and name it Zoe. He didn’t budge… UNTIL I brought up how our baby would feel about being named after a dead cat. He kinda made a face and was like “…oh yea.” He explained he forgot there was a third party involved in this and that we want our baby to love their name and their identity. So, we finally decided on a name; Bronwyn Jane (insert last name). Wynnie as a nickname until she outgrows it lol! I’ve only ever known one other Bronwyn my whole life and apparently it’s a pretty popular name in Europe, but we both thought it sounded pretty. Jane is both of our mothers’ names so we wanted to honor them too for our first baby :) again, thank you so much for the awesome advice. Hopefully I never have to post in this sub again!!!!!",

I have always told her until I feel that she is mature enough to speak about the conversation we will. But lately the past month she has been asking more and more and finally said well my dad has told me why so I don’t understand why can’t you. Her father 29 male has been speaking to my child and telling her his side of events that lead to us no longer being together. Now my daughter has anger towards me as she thinks I’m keeping secrets from her but I just keep telling her that conversation it between adults and not a child. I have been with my current partner male 30 for about two years and have recently had a new addition to our family. We have always done things together never leaving my daughter out. But as of couple of days she says she no longer loves him as he is the reason her dad and I can’t go back together. But her dad has had a relationship couple of months after our seperation but it seems her father cant do wrong only I. I have confronted my ex husband and the only thing he tells me is that he will not stop answering her questions due to her wanting to know and that he sees no wrong.UPDATE:Thank you for all the advices I have received but to answer two questions as they are being asked numerous times. I might have not worded it correctly 1. The reason of my divorce was due to multiple cheating that happened through our marriage during work trips and out of them 2. In our divorce I didn’t fight for anything as I just wanted our daughter to see how a healthy relationship should be between her father and I not once argued Infront of her.We divorce when she was just 2 years old since the day we both separated she understood as I always told her she appropriate information for her to understand. My ex husband and I had agreed that when she was 8 we will speak about the reason why our divorced happed which obviously that didn’t happen. Our daughter understands what it is to have two homes. And have our significant other in her life and what they represent which she has great relationships with them. I have done everything in my power for this not to affect our child. She understands it was not due to her and that we both love her so much what she is wondering as to why I don’t speak about the conversation is due to my ex saying that he tried to fix our marriage but I didn’t want to and that I left and took her with me. And blamed my current partner as to why mommy and daddy can’t no longer get back together as we have a child. Which I have the right to restart my life but in his eyes I do not have that right. Everything was calm in our divorce until I got married and had another child and which triggered him and started to tell our daughter information that we both discuss as of when it should of been said to her.My partner and I have both agreed that if he doesn’t want to take counseling we will be putting our daughter through it as I do want her to her that it has never been because of her but life took us in different path. She doesn’t hold any hate towards our newborn in the other hand she loves her and is a great big sister. She just feels that I need to be more open to her in certain conversations which I agree but to a certain limit. He father will always be her father but I just want him to understand certain things should involved our child as she is too young. Will be contacting my lawyer in regards to the proper steps I have to take to not allow this to happen once again. As I have done everything in my end to make him understand but doesn’t seem to be enough. I can’t dwell in what if he decides not to do anything until he is ready as this is not about him our I but about our child and what benefits her the most.But once again thank you for all the comments and advice that everyone has given me I do appreciate it.",

When she was asked for a full list of what she was allergic to she said her mom had the list and she didn't know.

My mom got in the way and came to my defense but the a lot of the family is saying I was in the wrong and should just have stopped eating.

The biggest bedroom is our room, the medium sized bedroom is a guest room and my husband uses the dresser in it for his clothes. And the smallest of the bedrooms is my husband’s room- a man cave, one may call it.We also have a “sunroom” which for the most part has been dedicated as mine. It’s a bit of a larger space and is our means to the backyard. We use it a lot for entertaining but I took control of the decor and the vibe of the room. About a third of the room I have made into a little yoga/pilates studio. I have plants everywhere and all of my equipment is coordinated to the decor- a great little zen spot if I do say so myself. And the other 2/3s of the room has a sofa and a table and the door to the back yard.My husband’s family has a traveling Peloton bike. It’s been with his parents, then to us, then with his brother and now it’s traveling back to us. I personally don’t like it but my husband thinks it’s a good workout. Anyway, he says he’s going to put it in the sunroom. I told him no and said he could put it in the guest room, his room or the garage. He says that the sunroom has the most space for it and it’s the nicest room in the house so it will be nice for him to work out in there.Now for those of you who have seen a Peloton bike in person, they aren’t the sleekest. It’s big and clunky and black and 1. Does not fit the bright, light natural sanctuary I made the room to be and 2.

Like I said, Emma is quiet and doesn't really talk much at all at dinner. On Saturday night after a bit of coaxing from Kate, Emma told me she got to a B in her science class (which is pretty rare for her) and I told her I was happy for her.Later that same night while I was working she came into my office and asked if I wanted to see her creative writing project for her English class, but I told her I was busy and she could show me tomorrow. I didn't get a look at her but as she was walking out she said \"If it was Jacob asking you would drop everything you were doing\"In the morning after the kids went to school, Kate came to me and said I needed to stop being so dense and that she was tired of having Emma come to her crying because her own father will barely pay attention to her or give her a compliment.I didn't think I was doing anything particularly harmful or neglectful, but I've been second guessing myself and figured I would lay it out here for others to judge.",

Rene has not offered to help us with the cost of the trip, and if we all go this will be a huge hit for us financially, and we would have to take multiple PTOs as well.If Rene is not willing to pitch in, we realistically cannot go, but Rene seems to think that since we have been best friends for so long, we should be there for her special day. She has talked about wanting to have her wedding in California since we were teenagers, and we all know that her dream included us as her bridesmaids. We plan on telling her that while we love her, we cannot afford to go financially. We are worried that she will get offended that all of her bridesmaids do not think that her wedding is worth the time and effort.She also comes from a very well-off family, as does her fiancé. She is currently in grad school and does not have an income.

We had a very large group of friends,we all graduated in summer but we all kept in touch over summer until now. Now these play fights or “spars” as my bf would say were all fun and games but they actually led my bf to believe he could actually fight because S (who says he does mma) said he’s naturally good.This led to a massive ego and he said he wanted to have a actual fight, and one of our other friends dad owned a gym with ring and he said he could let him fight there (idk if that was even legal). S proposed a guy for him to fight and it was a guy back from school I’ll call A. S was friends with A(not close friends) and I knew A because we used to sit next to each other in class.

A was a quiet guy, but as we sat next to each other for a year I knew probably more than others about him, he was pretty much just one of those traditional masculine males in a physical sense, worked out 6 days a week, rode horses and did archery, owned large dogs but was one of those guys that looked intimidating but was actually a nerdy and friendly guy. My bf didn’t like A or A’s friends, and neither did the rest of the boys in our friends group. I always questioned my bf on this as A had literally never even spoken to him, and my bf used to say it’s because A is so arrogant and thinks he’s so good looking, this led to a lot of arguments with my bf, because why did my bf care if other women were attracted to A when he had me?Nobody knew if A could fight but S said he told him something about he had been training in some form of martial arts. The whole build up to this my bf was acting so childish, he’d constantly try insult A in a group chat that was made and A wouldn’t even open them 90% of the time and I dont think he responded once. When the fight came along there was only one outcome from the start,  A was visibly towering over my bf, and he had clearly bulked up. On top of that, turned out he could fight, my bf lost in i’d say 90 seconds.After it I didn’t bother consoling him, I berated him because I expressed my concern multiple times and he picked not to listen to me. He said I’m an AH because I should support him unconditionally if I really loved him. He now wont speak to me, because he says I embarrassed him in front of his friends while he was vulnerable. Part of me feels bad but I feel like he needed to hear the truth.",

He's currently in hospital and it was last minute so I agreed.Her dog is a little spaniel/hound mutt and I have my own spaniel so assumed it would be fine, you know? As you can assume, it is not fine.Her dog is awful. He isn't toilet trained, barks, isn't socialised (growls at kids, constantly jumping, lunges at cars). He eats everything, can't leave him for a second. He howls incessantly.I can't cope with him. I can't even pee. He doesn't let me sleep or eat. I have had to take time off work.On Thursday I called my sister and told her she needs to send me money to board him because I can't cope. She called me a bitch and told me that I know what puppies are like and I shouldn't be bothering her in a time like this (with her dad being in hospital).Yesterday he destroyed one of my dads shirts I had in the laundry basket and it was the straw that broke the camels back. I told her she had until Monday to send me the money or I'm going to drop him off at a shelter.He's chipped and our local shelter has a space for \"abandoned\" pets - the owners have 14 days to come and collect their pets, so it's not like she'll lose him forever.She got pretty angry and upset and hasn't spoken to me about it. I am struggling still and don't know what to do.Our mom thinks I'm in the wrong but also won't watch the dog so I'm not sure I really care for her opinion.AITA here?",

And they love it too, in my house there are a lot of video games (PS5, Xbox, Nintendo) and a swimming pool, so it's very common on my holidays or at the end of the year for them to stay at my house a lot. I don't mind, they don't mind and the parents are grateful.My nephews are between 7-10 y (4 in total), it's not just a weekend of bad food, but we have pizza night, there are some sweets, but I try to maintain a balance.I have a sister who lives outside the country and has a son (4M).I only see her at the end of the year and this year is the second year that I have seen my nephew. And he's more fun I think, he's talking more, more playful and I love him so much.Well, this Saturday/Sunday I agreed to have a pajama party with all my nephews and everyone is excited. I sent my invitation to all the parents, including this sister of mine via message (this on Wednesday).On Thursday, she said, paraphrased \"(nephew name) would love it. But some rules we have established are that he shouldn't play for more than 2 hours, he must be in bed until 8 PM, no sugar after 6 PM, bath until 6 PM\" and some minor rules I asked if these rules were serious and when she said yes, I stressed that I wasn't babysitting my nephews, that I would take care of them and ensure their care, but I wouldn't control their schedule, how much candy they eat, etc.She started saying that if I want to have a 4 year old, I should wait for rules and that she wasn't being so demanding because he is a small child.I lost a little patience and said that if she wants to control this, she should hire a babysitter for her son here at home, because I'm not in the mood to be a babysitter the way she wants and it's supposed to be a fun night , not regulated.She didn't like it, saying that it wasn't much of what she asked for and if I offered to stay with a 4y, I should expect more rules and that I was being unfair in excluding a nephew from the others.My mother is on my sister's side, saying that it wasn't an impossible request, as I would have to pay more attention to him anyway, but my father stood by me because I already have 4 children and that I decide if it's too much. or not.AITA?",

	"body" : "I can't have kids, and it's been a thing I've dealt with my whole life. When I was in my late teens, I had this issue (not gonna get into details), and had to get both my testicles removed. Now, I've got these prosthetics and am on hormonal replacement therapy.I generally don't openly share this as I feel it's a personal matter. The only ones who know the details are my parents and my wife. She learned about it when we started dating because I prefer to be upfront. Fortunately, she's always been very understanding. Having children was never a priority for her, and since I can't, it's worked out well for both of us.However, since we got married, a few things have become a bit uncomfortable. The first two years were fine, but recently, it seems like a switch has flipped in the minds of people we know. Almost everyone now asks us, 'When are you gonna have kids?' We usually respond that it's not in our plans and try to steer the conversation elsewhere. However, some individuals are persistently annoying, saying things like 'Oh, but you guys need to' or 'You'll never be complete without kids.' It's starting to bother me quite a bit.So, last week during a meeting with a couple of friends, someone brought up the topic. Admittedly, I was already having a rough day, and when they asked about us having kids, I, against my better judgment, just said, 'Well, never. I can't have kids. I'm sterile, don't even have testicles. So, if you could kindly stop bothering us about it, I'd really appreciate it.\"As you can imagine, that comment really soured the mood for the entire evening. People got very upset and uncomfortable, to the point where both my wife and I decided to leave. I apologized to my wife, who seemed unbothered, claiming 'They had it coming,' but I'm aware that people in our friend group have been talking behind our backs. They say I was rude and acted like an asshole, insisting that they couldn't have known, and were just looking out for us. Now, I do feel like an asshole for the way I spoke; I could have communicated more civilly, especially for my wife's sake. She enjoys meeting our friends, and I doubt it will happen much in the near future until this blows over.Anyhow, Reddit, AITA? Also, forgive me if the text doesn't make much sense.

I wouldn’t consider myself a lazy person either, as I workout 3-5 times a week, wrestle during the winter, and clean the house 2-5 times a week, I don’t normally socialize often outside of school as I don’t feel motivated to do so, so then I just stay inside and either play my game, read, study a language, or pray.3 years ago. my mom and dad both worked, my mom use to work around 50-80 hours a week to “catch up” on bills, often times she would come home tired and would sleep during the day, while my dad worked around 40-50 ish hours and would be tired too. Often times my mom would complain about no one doing anything around the house and calls me and my sister lazy, I usually don’t say anything to those complaints, but sometimes i get irritated and say i actually clean around the house and that you only sleep so of course you wouldn't pay attention.Moving forward a year or so when my mom announced she was pregnant, I was kinda of irritated because she would always complain about bills and how she needed to catch up on them, I proceeded to say how are you going to say you need to catch up on bills but then have another child, I cant remember what she had told me, but a month or two later the reason she wanted to have another kid was because “I love being a mother” in my head at the time I kinda seen it as selfish as she didn’t want to be “alone”.Somewhere in June or July (2023) my mom was pregnant but then had a miscarriage 5 weeks later, 2 weeks later she gets pregnant again with a girl.I wanted to work over the summer and be a little bit more independent as I’m only a few years from being a legal adult so I ask my mom can I work, she says yes but she needs to get money for an ID. The next thing you know she never gives me my ID to work.My mom complains that I go out a lot and give my attention to my girlfriend instead of my baby sister or the “things” around the house saying I half a** things around here. Many times I don’t have a problem with playing/watching my sister but at times my mom makes it seem like I’m obligated to watch my sister anytime she’s tired from work or sees she’s “struggling”. And that she once again says she pays for everything and all I do is ask for items just because I clean the house “like I’m supposed to do”. Which I feel as isn’t true as I hardly ask for wants, one comment she said was I can walk to school mind you it’s the winter and when I wanted to walk to school. She said it was not safe to do so. And she won’t be paying my phone bill anymore as it’s her money and have my girlfriend pay for it instead. I made the comment when I wanted to work you said no because I’m not “ready” then started yelling at me telling me to go to my room while slamming the doors.",

	"body" : "Throwaway because this is just embarrassing.I’ll get straight to the point: My BIL does not like showering. My sister has casually mentioned in the past how he showers once every 4-5 days because “he doesn’t really get dirty.”He has extremely strong BO and I don’t think I’ve ever been in a place with him where he did not stink. Even fresh out a shower, you can still smell very strong hints of sweat and…other types of smells when you’re standing near him. People have brought this up with her in the past, and every single time she just shuts them down and says that they’re looking for excuses to hide that they do not like him.One of our mutual friends is getting married in 3 weeks and it’s about 9 hours away from where my sister’s family and I currently live (we do not live together, but we’re about 15 minutes away from one another).My sisters informs me a few days ago that she will be riding with me to the wedding because their car is having some engine issues. None of this was discussed, she just informed me like she was relaying a message.I cannot explain to any of you how much I shiver at the slight thought of being in the same car with her husband for 9 whole hours. He does not like sitting in the back and will most likely ride shotgun. To avoid this, I offered to lend my boyfriend’s car to my sister, as he is out of state for the next few months and will not be using his car. She repeatedly said no, no matter how many times I insisted.So, I decided that the best choice for me is to just book a flight to the location and rent a car from the airport when I land. I have some points I can use to get a discount so it all works out.I tell my sister that I’ll be taking a flight instead of driving, and I told her that she can feel free to use either my car or my boyfriend’s car if she’d like to drive there. At this point, I haven’t booked my flight yet, because I wanted to inform her before I went ahead.She fully blew up on me and demands that I cancel my flight (because she thinks I already booked it) and says that we will be going forward with her plan instead. Continuous arguments led to the truth, where she lets it slip that their car is fine, they just didn’t feel like driving or wasting money on gas and tolls and were just looking forward to a relaxing drive across the country.I was tired of beating around the bush, so I just told her the truth, in a very polite way because at the end of the day, she is my sister and the person I’m talking about is her husband, so there’s no point in being harsh.She gets beyond upset and just blasts me with at least 50 texts about how I’m an A-hole. I feel bad about this but I’m truly conflicted.Edit: I forgot to mention, she is also texting the bride and informing her that she wont be attending the wedding because of me. The bride is now stressed out and keeps contacting my sister for more information but my sister is just icing both the bride and myself out.",

	"body" : "So my (25F)  husband (26M) is upset with me because last night his mom called him to ask us if we wanted to attend a family event later this week. I told him we could but he sensed some lack of enthusiasm from me or just got the general feeling that I already wasn't looking forward to it. He asked me why I always act like that when some kind of event involving his family comes up. I finally told him its because his mom will make me uncomfortable when we go to these events.She's always commenting about our toddler sons weight (who is nearly 2.5) and how he doesn't eat enough. We recently took a out of state trip for the holidays and stayed with some of his family. For a total of 3 days I feel like they nonstop talked about our toddlers eating habits and how he's \"so skinny\".  She made comments like \"he used to be such a good eater\" and by used too she means when he was 6-7 months old and barely starting to even taste food. She even specifically asked if he weighs 40 pounds yet, to which I replied I think he would be considered overweight if he weighed 40 pounds after a quick google search that said an average child will weigh 40 pounds closer to 4 years of age. My son was born ver small at only 5 pounds 7 ounces and is super active, nonstop playing all day. He probably weighs around 26 or 27 pounds which his pediatrician says is average and has never once showed concern regarding his weight/eating habits. Not only around his family does she do this but every time we take him to her house, which is not that often but maybe 3 or 4 times a month she never fails to comment that he's \"wasting away\" or ervytime she sees him he is much thinner than before.I also told him his mom does it to pick on me since every time she is sick with the cold or flu she makes huge pots of soups and invites us over to eat since she's made so much. Last time we were thinking of somewhere to go out to eat because I had cooked all week and didn't have the energy that specific day or even feel like cooking. His mom called while we were deicing and let him know that she made a big pot of soup if we wanted to go over to eat. He said oh thats great since we were deciding on going out to eat anyways and I was up for it (to go eat at his moms) she then asked how I was doing because I had just recently gotten over having covid. Mind you I am currently 7 months pregnant with our second. My husband told her I was doing much better and she said oh good because she was very sick with something which is why she made soup. Needless to say after the call I told my husband we wouldn't be going over because I could not get sick again and I didn't want our son getting sick either. This part of the rant is more to show that she really can't be that concerned over our toddler's health since she's always doing stuff like the above.Anyways, my husband thinks I hate his mother and I don't know how to tell her if she could lay off the comments about toddlers weight not sounding like an AH",

She got a new TV or a new phone, new laptop, Calico Critters and trampolines when she was younger and all kinds of scooters and stuff.She would get gifts to open on my birthday and would often get to blow out my candles and my parties had to be catered to her but hers were not catered to me and I never got a gift at her birthday partiesShe got to choose where we'd get takeout once a week and I had no inputShe got her room freshly decorated once a year and however she wanted but I only had mine done twice when I could remember and I had no inputShe got to have a TV and her laptop in her room but I could notShe never had to include me when seeing her friends but my parents would insist I had to include her with mineThey have a college fund for her but they never had one for meShe could ask for money whenever and always got it.

	"title" : "AITA for getting angry about being excluded from my fiancé’s family vacation after being invited?",
	"body" : "Fake names for privacy. I am based in the southern USA.I (20F) have been with my fiancé (20M) \"Alan\" for 4.5 years. Alan has an older sister \"Kristine\" (23F), and both parents (FFIL/FMIL). Alan's family likes to go on vacation every/every other year, usually a cruise through touristy islands in NA.In 2020, before we had even been dating for a year, I was invited on a cruise with them to Puerto Rico, and I (16 then) managed to get all the money together within 2 weeks, but the trip was cancelled due to Covid restrictions. In 2022, when my fiancé graduated high school, they went on a cruise as a family and I was not invited, and was asked to dogsit for them. This year is the first year I would be able to go with them in summer 2024.Kristine (currently single) usually has 3-6 month relationships, and her boyfriends have always been welcome on vacations regardless of how long they've been together. This makes me angry, as I have been with Alan for longer than any of them, and yet was still not invited. This brings me to today:Having talked about a cruise back in November of 2023, I just reminded them I would not like for it to be over my birthday (late June) and would rather it be in July. They agreed, and since it was a long ways out, we did not mention it again. Apparently (as I found out today), FFIL had booked the tickets in December, but did not include me in the booking (even though I was invited by them directly in November).Either I pay an extra $2,000 for a room across the ship and find someone else to join, or I don't go. That's kind of where we're at. I am angry that I was asked directly, and was really excited about the trip, but was not included. Alan is conflicted about what to do, and is trying to convince his parents to refund the tickets and rebook it with me included (after I bothered him for 2 hours to fix this).I would pay for my portion of the trip, which I do not mind (and I expected to do anyways), I just feel extremely disrespected by being asked to join then not being booked because \"I didn't badger them enough to remember to add me in\". I didn't even know they had booked the tickets, considering it is still 6 months out, and FFIL/FMIL are not wanting to change their bookings. AITA for being angry at being excluded for this?——————ETA: After speaking to FFIL/FMIL, Alan talked to Kristine and asked if she could ask her friends if there was someone to join so I would not be paying the full value of the room (2 beds). What I did not originally know was that an extra room could be added onto their booking, so we would all still be near each other instead of across the ship like it would be if I booked separately, and their reasoning was “We can’t have an odd number of people because that would be paying for an unused bed.”I am still conflicted on whether or not I want to actually go, because FFIL/FMIL did not directly tell us when they had booked, and I am hearing all of this secondhand from Alan (The group chat I made in November called “Cruise 2024” sits untouched as of now). In general they are nice people, and usually a go-with-the-flow type of family, so it was a surprise all of this was booked so far in advance, which is why I hadn’t asked originally for updates.——————ETA 2: For those asking, we have been together for 4.5 years, engaged for 4 months. We plan to stay engaged for many years, get our degrees and be in a stable financial situation before fully settling down at 23-24 years old.——————ETA 3: To everyone speculating that Alan is part of the reason I was not included in the booking, saying he is not a good person and to leave him: You are hearing 1 situation out of 4.5 years of a relationship. Not everything is a “break up with them immediately” moment, and while I appreciate your advise, your assumptions are just that: assumptions. You do not know everything about my relationship, nor the relationship he has with his parents.That is not at all what this post is about. I was asking if MY anger was justified at his PARENTS, nothing about him. Please stop saying to break up with him when you don’t know anything at all about us. He is the one playing middle man here, speaking to his parents about the situation on my behalf, as it’s not my place to confront them. The 2 hours was was spent trying to get him to figure out what to SAY, not to actually confront them. Poor wording on my part, but still stands that this is not a relationship advice post at all.——————FINAL ETA 4: To answer similar questions in the comments because replying individually to 700+ comments is absurd:Current booking is FFIL/FMIL in one room, Kristine/Alan in another room. If I and Kristine’s friend were to join, it would be FFIL/FMIL, Kristine/Friend, Alan/Me. It does not matter who is in what room, just that each person has a paid for spot. This is why they did not book me. As far as rooms with single beds/triple beds, It is more expensive than paying for a double.As far as I know, you cannot have double occupancy per bed (kind of like sitting in the same seat on a flight). So even though Alan and I would still sleep in the same bed, I would still need one booked for myself.The group chat was created by me because his parents are technologically challenged, and while it was my idea, it was so his parents could inform us of the bookings and other things to keep us both in the loop. No one has used the chat since it’s creation in November, hence why neither Alan or I knew the tickets were even booked in the first place. Alan only found out when asking in passing yesterday, his parents did not bring it up.Alan and I cannot afford our own trip together, as we are both college students, and I cannot pay for an entire trip alone. I do not have enough friends (nor can they pay for it) for me to go on my own vacation separately from his family. Alan cannot afford to buy a separate booking from his parents on the same cruise either, and his spot is already paid for, so that would just be a waste of money, regardless of the principle it holds. As for me paying for a single bed room, those are double the price for a double bed room, which I have to split with the friend anyways (this is paying for our spots, not which bed we’ll sleep in; see above on bedding situation). It is the only affordable option for me to join.About my engagement: There is a ring (don’t know why that matters), and we have been talking about marriage since about 2 years into our relationship. The decision for an extended engagement was a mutual decision, as it is logically the most beneficial outcome. This way, we have experience living together prior to marriage, we both will have degrees and a stable financial situation before fully settling down.It is not my place to ask his parents to change their plans on their vacation, which is why Alan is playing middleman. My anger came from their lack of communication: inviting me directly, not booking me, then not saying anything about the booking until Alan happened to ask about it in passing.Yet again, this is not a relationship advice post. I cannot give you a full 4.5 year backstory on 1 situation, as that is highly unnecessary and way too identifiable. We have been through a lot together (death, hospitalization, addiction recovery, etc), and we will continue to do so. An update will be given in the coming months as we make our decision/any other changes happen to the current situation.",

John responds with 'The pizzas I cooked at boardgames night'Now to preface this 1. He offered to make pizza and host boardgames, which he decided to do on his own accord and 2. Did not ask anyone for money for doing so beforehand or say it would cost $$.So with a bit of conversation back at forth (since I've never had anyone ask me for money for a home cooked meal)... he said he was asking for money since I asked him for money for fish and chips. Now the fish and chips were not home cooked and it has ALWAYS been the case that we pay for ourselves at a restaurant or fast food/take out. And I would expect to give him money if it was the other way round.I mentioned this to him and he said he sees it differently quote \"a meal for a meal\".I then asked if he has requested $18 off any of our other friends. Which he said no.So I said 'this is unfair and he's changing how we usually handle these sort of situations and specifically targeting me for some reason...And he said it was because the other friends will bring drinks and smokes etc and share it with him, which I do not.To which I responded, 'well I don't drink or smoke' and also I've NEVER charged you for a home cooked meal.'Then some angry messages were sent my way and we have not spoken.I can send him $18, it's not about the money... It's just how he has handled the situation, is singling me out, and especially charging me after the fact (which has never happened before and is not normal behavior).AITA for not giving my friend $18 for a home cooked pizza?30/12/23 -  UPDATEThanks everyone for the responses.I sent my mate the $18 and said let's meet up in person to chat. So he agreed he handled the situation incorrectly and that charging for a home cooked meal is not cool (and just not what we do in our friend group, unless otherwise stated).But everyone reading between the lines was correct, he was angry at me for not chipping in enough at gatherings etc. Which I now understand is my bad.So basically I bought him a vape on the way to the meet up (something else I had been using of his but never supplying) and said I'll start contributing to gatherings with snacks.We agreed to communicate better going forward and we hugged and made up. So all good So in conclusion I think this was a ESH situation, he handled his communication poorly and I didn't realize I was being a mooch, causing my friend to feel used.",

	"body" : "So i (15m) am going to pass from 10th to 11th grade this winter break. Every year at my highschool they do this big mexican celebration (im in mexico) to clebrate our tradition and shiz, and everyone is mandated to participate in it. They give each grade a little post to sell food and drinks, and they give us a bunch of tickets so we can sell them and fund the party.My (20f) sister went to the same school i am in and put herself as my tutor, wich means shes basically the one the school sends the emails and calls about tuition and stuff like that, so since shes alredy been to about 3 of this partys she knows the gist of it and was supposed to help me sell the tickets, aswell as my (50m) father who  is the one who pays for the tuition. When i told him said \"yeah ill help you sell em\". A month passes and its a week before the party, and i had still not sold any tickets, and i forgot about them cause of exams and they where just collecting dust in my drawer.Thats when my father tells me \"hey you wanna go to seaworld with me n your stepmom?\" Wich to i say \"sure\", but i was on the day of the party, wich i didnt really mind not going to cause its seaworld. After i return, the party is over and i never hear from the tickets again. A week after that, i get told by the principal i need to pay some late fees on tuition n extra stuff (wich i presume where the tickets), i tell my dad and he pays with some troubles from the sales department at the highschool, but it gets resolved.Mind this is in late september, jump to a week ago at the end of the winter break when my sister comes to me saying \"hey, i just got a call from school saying you need to pay for the tickets you had to sell, how many did you sell?\" And i told her \"none, i didnt go to the party, plus, you n dad didnt really help me sell shit\" to wich she gets mad at me for \"not being responsible\" and i tell her \"tf was i supposed to do???\" To wich she responded \"you couldve sold them to your friends\" wich i did try, none of them wanted to get in extra dept. she tells me that we have to pay for the tickets, and i ask her how much is it, SHE SAYS 30 BUCKS PER TICKET. I found the old strip of tickets amd counted 16, wich means at a total it would cost us about 400-500 dollars.now my sister and mom are mad at me for this, and i dont even know if my father knows yet, and i cant sell them now that the party was done 4 months ago, i honestly dont think im the ah in this situation, cause this is the first of this partys i was in and my sister was supposed to help me out, she did nothing, and my father was supposed to help me sell the dang tickets, he also did nothing, i did my part to the best of my knoledge and they did not help at all, now my family is mad at me....so reddit. AITA?Update: i tough i might need to clear up somethings about my situation, so heres a quick notes:i really dont want to just place the blame somewhere else, i believe in consequences for actions, i also see how i have may come across as irresponsible, wich i kinda are, i have no real expirience with this stuffI really couldnt just \"take responsibility\" of selling the tickets, people at school didnt want more tickets, i dont know anyone outside school, and i couldnt sell them around cause i aint allowed to wander around in the streets, also i couldnt sell them online, thats why i needed the help from my family.When i say \"oh i forgot\" i mean that i was in the middle of exam season and had to study for ablut 12 differen exams and projects wich took all my attention at the momentUpdate 2: aight i think to clear up MORE things4. some people seem to think i just got the tickets and didnt even mention them to my parents, and now blame them, and sorry if i told it like that, english aint my first language and its my first time writing a aita story. I did tell my family about my tickets, for about 2 weeks straight, we got the tickets at the start of the semester, i talk to my family about it, then at the end lf the semester i entered exams and thats when i left the tickets in a drawer. i asked them about 7 times in 2-3 weeks before the exams came5. The tickets arent a house to house sale, they literally just give you a bunch of tickets n say \"sell em\"Update 3 and final: well i read alot of your comments and responded to a few, and the situation just got resolvedYES im a ass for not remembering my responsibility YES the school is a ass for giving students over 400 dollars worth of stuff YES my fam couldve help me more At the end of the day im mostly at fault, and i accept itI just talked to my father about the matter and he told me to not worry too much about it, he will pay the fee, and even apologized for not helping me sell the tickets, i also apologized for getting him into this mess, as for my sister i think shes still mad at me, but i think itll blow offThanks for the kinda reality check and for the supportAlso if any tiktokers see this: DO NOT POST THIS STORY, I DONT MEAN THIS AS CLOUT CHASING AT ALL, I TRULY FEAR THIS GETTING BACK TO MY KNOWN ONES OR EVEN THE SCHOOLThanks for reading ",

	"body" : "About seven months ago, I (21F) was gifted two bottles of wine that were gifted from a beloved friend for my 21st birthday. I left both at my mom's house for safe-keeping as I went back to my college dorm. Well, I went home for the holidays only to find out that they were missing to which my stepfather confessed that he drank it. I was in disbelief especially since it was clear they were mine (from the very unique packaging and he was present at the gathering), and kept asking whether he was serious. He just laughed each time and said he couldn't find anything like it, etc. never once apologizing.I then felt the need to leave. My mom followed me to my car and questioned why I would leave such special gifts at the house and why I'm just now asking for it seven months later (not true, as I had asked about it 3 months ago while the house was getting cleaned). She also said that it was an \"honest mistake\" and that she'll find a replacement, and what more do I want for her to do... I proceed to tell her that I left some possessions behind since it's my home too. I also told her that it seemed like there there weren’t any room for me at her place due to her other family now. There are other instances where my mom would have a pattern of disfavoring me. Anyway, my mom then told me that it sounds like I'm making any excuse to go live with my (biological) dad instead of her and how she's trying her hardest to raise us. She brought up the fact that she pays for my car insurance and phone plan again (which is true).I decided to live with my grandma upon graduation for my gap year since I don't feel welcomed at my mom's anymore, nor can I live with my dad (even though he offered) since it would upset her. It's not like I expected an apology, but it would've been nice to receive any acknowledgement of how I felt over losing a cherished gift just like that. But am I the asshole for overreacting/blowing things out of proportion especially after everything she’s done for me? And am I also being ungrateful by harboring a bit of resentment towards my stepfather over something so materialistic?EDIT: I'm getting questions as to why I chose not to live with my dad. Reason being that the last time I stayed at his place over the holiday break, my mom had irregular heart palpitations that lead to a doctors visit; it was caused by the stress of it all. As to where I left the booze, I left it in my so-called bedroom, but it was moved to the pantry by I'm guessing either my stepdad or mom (didn't stick around to ask for more details at the time and I doubt my preteen sister moved it).mini UPDATE: There has been no follow-up on reimbursement or an apology of any sort. No phone call or text message. Just silence on both sides. I'll be holding out for a bit longer but with the way things are going, I will most likely be discussing with my dad about possibly moving into the bedroom that he already has set up for me at his house.",

This is her second wedding. She had an affair and cheated on my husbands father with the person she is now engaged to. So she is now marrying her affair partner. I didn’t even realize their anniversary date is September 20, until a week ago. So basically her “anniversary date” is the day her affair started. Since she was sneaking around with this guy, she never announced an anniversary date until just now. Also, when I said we typically go to Disney world for her birthday every year, I meant we go that same week in September every year, and have done so since 2018.

My SIL initially put some distance between herself & our family. After a little while we started talking occasionally, mainly just how each other & our kids were doing etc. That’s when I found out that my brother was tracking all of her phone calls via logging into their cell phone account which was in his name. He called me & something seemed off about my brother, he was being short & just kept asking so what did you do today, what else happened? Finally I said oh and SIL called me today. He then proceeded to tell me in a very mean tone “you’re lucky you mentioned it to me or you would be on the list”.

He started making the phone calls & one of those calls was to my soon to be ex-SIL. The next day my brother called me irate & wanted to know why my husband had called her. I told him that the call was to tell her about my brain tumor & upcoming surgery. My brother then said “it doesn’t take 26 minutes to tell someone you have a brain tumor”. My brother then told me that I am dead to him. He blocked my # & blocked me from all social media. Since then I have had my surgery & am doing well. He never reached out before or after the surgery.

I responded yes as this is something he and I have discussed and both want. She immediately responded, “that’s great!” Followed with “don’t expect your father and I to pay for anything for the wedding!” Bc she said “we’re too old.” (This will be important later). This was completely unprompted as I had never asked. To this I responded that he and I don’t really want a wedding and we’re not sure what we’ll do after engagement and when it comes time to plan. Her response was that “I better not elope again” and “she expects” “a nice wedding of some kind regardless of the size.” For context: I eloped with my first husband and she was embarrassed and devastated (her words). We ended the phone call by me saying she can’t have expectations if she’s not willing to contribute and that I wasn’t even engaged yet and we’ll talk about it later. My boyfriend and I don’t make a ton of money and probably cannot afford even a small ceremony and wedding dinner for even ten people if we’re being honest. We’re fine. But we don’t have $4K laying around and let’s be honest even with a tiny wedding you’re looking at that amount. Anyways, fast forward a few months and my TWIN (so same age) brother gets engaged. We’re all very excited for him. Last night my mother and I were discussing his plans (as I was trying to get the scoop and my brothers kinda tight lipped about things). She lets it slip on our phone call that they’re planning a large wedding and my parents are footing half the bill, splitting it with the brides parents. I reminded her of our conversation and she immediately called me a jealous brat and ended the phone call. Am I the asshole for being upset?For clarity: my issue is that she’s (my mother) is insisting on a nice wedding of some kind. Insisting with no financial backing. The salt in the wound was to find out she’s paying for half my brothers and won’t admit this is not about “age” as she’d previously said with no explanation just further demands that if I do get married there will be a wedding paid out of my pocket",

	"body" : "So my daughter is 9 and has been generally good with food. She usually eats everything.A few weeks ago my wife was traveling for work and I had a family emergency back in my home country so suddenly we needed someone to look after our daughter Chloe for about a week, and my wife's brother Owen (30M) volunteered and saved the day.Owen is a foodie and to be fair makes delicious food but he's also quite picky and maybe a bit judgemental of food that isn't done properly or isn't fancy enough. This isn't usually an issue though.Looks like during this time Chloe and Owen had the time of their lives because my daughter was quite happy in the end, and well, we learned about the surprises later on. Apparently Owen fed her some really fancy food and kind of changed her perspective about a lot of the food we typically eat.I learned this the hard way, when Chloe asked for a grilled cheese and then didn't eat what I made her (typical American style which she always liked), wanted it the way her uncle Owen made it. I called Owen for the recipe but goodness me, I had to buy like 10 new ingredients, several types of cheese, a kind of bread that I don't have or can't make, make fresh Bechamel sauce or whatever it's called, etc... like I don't have time to do any of these and they are expensive. I did give this a try and my daughter did say it was nice but not as good as he uncle Owen's.This keeps on happening now. Pretty much everything me or my wife make, or when we order Pizza, she says this is not good and wants it the way Owen does it. We then call Owen for the recipe and everything is complex, expensive, needs equipment we don't have and time consuming.Owen hosted Christmas dinner and Chloe asked to go there early to help her uncle and well, the day after that said that is how we should make food!In my kind of frustration I called Owen and told him he kind of made our lives a lot more difficult. We never had trouble with food before and now it's the number one issue. He suggested that maybe we can expand our horizons and it's good for Chloe too to experience a wider range of food choices instead of complaining to her person who gives good food to Chloe.My wife agrees that it's a lot more difficult now but says it was kind of an asshole thing to complain to Owen when he was doing us a favor and he hasn't done anything except give Chloe good and healthy food.

Since my post last week, a few things happened (including Christmas, of course).Some people in the comments suggested accepting the iPad, but hiding it away until Arthur was old enough to use it. I really didn't want to do that at first, but after talking to my husband, we decided we could try to make it work.I told my father we'd come to my aunt's place for Christmas and accept the iPad on the condition that he didn't let Arthur see it. Our plan was to tell him that grandpa had gotten him a gift for when he got bigger. He had said he wanted a Hot Wheels track for Christmas a while ago, and my husband and I had bought it for him, so we offered to have my dad gift it to him instead.I expected my father to agree. Instead, he accused me and my husband of not trusting him and Shelly, as well as denying Arthur something he'd spent so much money on. He also denied our race track idea, saying that he had the right to decide what he'd get for his own grandson.I hung up on him and called my aunt to tell her we weren't coming for Christmas. She asked me about it, and I ended up explaining the situation to her.Well, it turns out that mine and my kids' presences were more important to her and my cousins than my father's. My aunt threatened to ban him and Shelly from her place if they gave Arthur the iPad.After a small fight and a crying fit from Shelly (I'm not exaggerating), all over the phone, my father apologized and asked what else he could get my son for Christmas. I gave him ideas of toys, books and art kits Arthur would like.He ignored them and got a pair of socks. Whatever, Arthur still liked it.My father and Shelly gave the iPad to her sister's kids (they now have two). I know that because Shelly made a point of telling Arthur, in front of me, that her nephews got the \"best gift ever\", and that she was sorry he couldn't have the same thing.Arthur just kept playing with his new Lego set. He either didn't listen or didn't care. I still made sure to keep her away from him throughout the night.My dad saw that, and I think he finally realized my kid wouldn't care about the iPad. He called me yesterday and apologized, more sincerely this time.All that said, I think you guys are right about him. This whole incident has made it clear that he doesn't really respect me as a parent or care about my boundaries for my children.

(Homeroom teachers and all) but this is how college works in my country.Before this starts I would like to apologize for any spelling mistakes. English is not my first language.I (F21) have been going to college since September of last year. From September to November we had a really nice lady as our main professor (homeroom teacher). She was already at the end of pregnancy when we started the school year so unfortunately she had to go. In December, we got a different professor (M38). I’ll call him K. K was a nice guy. He wasn’t too old, so he got along with a lot of the students, he was funny and everyone who knew him loved him.A week before winter break, he had everyone do a PowerPoint presentation about themselves. Which, although some of us found childish, we all liked him so nobody complained. Multiple students did their presentations before me, and all was fine, until it was my turn.I am a contortionist and the summer before college I got to perform in a travelling circus. I had been to that circus many times before so it was very cool that I got to be part of the show. Contortion being my biggest hobby, I obviously mentioned it in my presentation.When I mentioned that I got to perform in a circus, and that it was my dream job, K burst out laughing. He said: “I’ve never heard someone be this excited to be a clown”. Everyone else in class started to laugh. It’s a bit ignorant to assume that everyone in a circus is a clown, but fine. My mood changed however when I showed them a picture of me in contortion. (Like many poses in contortion, I was pretty much bent in half). When I showed that picture, one of my classmates yelled: “Now that’s an arched back”, to which K, who should be more professional than that, responded: “I bet you’re quite popular in the bedroom”. My heart dropped when he said that. I could not believe it. I refused to finish my presentation. My classmates said I was overreacting.After class, when I was about to walk out, I turned to K and said: “Gross joke”. Then he said: “We’re all adults here. We can joke with each other. Sometimes you just have to put your ‘big girl pants’ on and suck it up”. I didn’t respond and walked out. At home I could not stop crying because I really felt uncomfortable with that joke. I can usually handle it, but for some reason I felt like an idiot standing there.I told my mom about what happened and she made me send an email to the school. They took it very seriously and said they would take immediate action. January 8 was my first day back at school after winter break. We were introduced to a new professor. She’s okay, but she is quite strict and not everyone likes her. She had a long lecture about inappropriate comments and how we as adults need to respect boundaries since we’re no longer little kids.Now a lot of my classmates are mad at me because they are blaming me for K being gone. I don’t know if K still works at our college. I’m not sure what happened to him. But everyone thinks I’m an asshole now.",

She had gotten it removed but she lost a lung in the process. Now onto the problem, after a messy divorce, my sister found a man that’s much younger than she is. He’s young so he wants to have a lot of children plus he comes from a culture where children are a major factor in marriage. He said he wants at least 3 kids. At first I thought after a while of dating my sister would tell her partner that she can’t give birth without major risked. She could literally die. She never did, now they are planning the wedding. When me and my other siblings confronted her she said that she’s willing to take the risk and that she wants more kids. I don’t agree with this because if she dies she leaves behind her already living son. So when my family was having dinner this Christmas I decided to bring up my sister’s surgery and the risk of getting pregnant. She left soon after cursing me out and yelling that I’m a lier. Her fiancé yelled at me, saying that surgery isn’t something I should lie about and how an immature teen doesn’t understand what the risk of pregnancy.

I’m getting a lot of questions about certain information I forgot to share. my family all know that he doesn’t know, my sister asked us to help her hide it and told us.We know there is a high chance she probably die from giving birth, a doctor explained it and told us the risk after her surgery and advised my sister to find alternative ways. My sister and her fiancé have been together for almost four years now. My sister does have other underlying things like diabetes as well as a problem with her heart(I don’t know the name of the problem but I know she has it) which is why she almost dies during her surgery. She had also almost dies giving birth to my nephew. I had never told her she can’t have kids, I am sorry the title is wrong I had thought Cant and shouldn’t mean the same thing in English. Me and my family have told her that she should tell him but she is pushing it off. I don’t want to ruin their relationship but she should tell him because of the risk.

I agreed that they may not be racist, but they will not go along their way to hook up with him when he barely knows the language/ is a foreigner, and that latinas are not that easy as he’s portraying them.

I didn't want to go to the wedding but my mom made it pretty clear that if I didn't go out relationship would never be the same again.I got really drunk beforehand so I could actually get through the wedding and because everything is way better when you're drunk and maybe a little stoned. I got to the ceremony like 25 minutes late and that really pissed my mom off but I was still there so my mom should  probably just be grateful that I was there at all ngl. Like I had a plan to ruin their wedding but I thought I'd just be wasting my time so I didn't.My mom and her husband have been so pissed at me since they said it was disrespectful going there drunk and that I ruined their wedding. I don't really know how I ruined their wedding the only thing I did which could be considered bad is making out with a guy but I don't think that's that bad so i don't really understand what the problem is tbh.But yeah I don't know I could be the asshole, they're both pretty upset at me and they haven't really spoken to me much other than to shout at me.",

	"body" : "Basically, the title, but here’s the context, I (M38) have a very messy family life, my dad cheated on my mom when I was about 15, this woman (who I’ll call Sara) also had a son, Mike (M38) who is a few months younger than me, she also cheated on her husband.When the affairs were exposed, and divorces were finalized, my dad and Sara got married, but our parents’ plan for a new blended and happy family quickly disappeared since Mike and I had no intention of being each other’s brother.We both lived primarily with our other biological parents and were rarely in the house together but very soon we talked it out and decided that we weren’t enemies and just wanted nothing to do with each other, so we have as neutral relationships as possible we don’t care for good or bad about the other.We both agreed that my dad and Sara suck, so when we were cold or impolite to our respective stepparent, we didn’t feel like we had to protect them or anything.A few years later, Paul(M22), our half-brother, was born. Due to age difference (and us basically hating that blended family), we were never close to Paul and had little to no impact on his life.Anyway, Paul is getting married to Laura (21) who is a very devout christian and has been pushing him to make an effort to “unite” our family.Laura has been using the wedding to try and get us to play happy family, at first it started with small annoyances like family chats and trying to get us involved in wedding planning.Originally Mike and me were just regular guest in the wedding but Paul asked us (as requested by Laura) to both be his best men, it felt awkward, but Paul never asked for anything, so we accepted.Last weekend we were supposed to go to a seminar (since Mike and I haven’t been to a church in years) to receive training on what to do at the ceremony, however it ended up being a set-up by Paul and Laura.When we arrived there was a Pastor, Laura, Paul, Mike and our parents. We were supposed to spend the weekend “healing” our family. Sara and Dad knew this beforehand and were on board, Mike, and I not so much, so we just left and opted to pull back from being part of the wedding, this upset Paul, he said that if we weren’t going as his best men, we wouldn’t be invited at all.This was acceptable to Mike and me since neither of us went to each other’s wedding. But now drama is everywhere. Extended family is contacting us to make us budge and all the circus that comes in this type of situation. My wife said that I am behaving like an asshole and should just suck it up, so I’m starting to doubt. Am I the asshole?",

	"body" : "I’ll try to be quick although it’s a long story.I (26F) live in a very small town with my dad (55M) who’s disabled. He can get around on his own, it’s just more convenient for us since I’m able to run most of the errands.Anyway dad has two cars, one has manual shift and the other is auto. Due to his mobility issues dad can’t drive the manual, so it’s usually me who’s driving it. Also my workplace is 2 hours away from where I live, it’s not a massive deal for me.I also have a coworker (40F) who relies on me for the rides even though it’s a 20 minute drive from her home to the workplace. So I pick her up and drop her off. She doesn’t have a car and public transportation is crappy in our area, and I also don’t charge her for rides since I pass her street on my way either way. She just checks the location app and goes out whenever she sees I’m approaching her place. Or sometimes I park in her driveway.Recently the manual car wasn’t starting so I had to take the auto car. It’s a really large SUV and I’m not very comfortable with driving it. I’ve been driving the manual car since high school and it’s a super tiny coupe so I’m used to smaller cars. It was literally my 1st time ever driving another car. Also the manual car is an import and it’s RHD, so my perception is slightly off when I drive a normal car.So she asked me to go in her driveway and since I was driving the larger car I messed up and accidentally hit the lawn with 2 of the wheels bc I’m used to sitting on another side and bc the auto car is wider than the manual one. Her driveway is super narrow and as I said I’m not familiar with driving huge cars so it was a mess up on my end.Anyway she saw the tire tracks on her lawn and was really pissed. She yelled at me saying that if I can’t go in the driveway without hitting the lawn I should get my license revoked. I explained that I couldn’t take my car bc it broke. She said that in this case I had to ask my dad to drive me to work. I got pissed bc it was an unreasonable demand, 1st of all my dad is disabled, 2nd he wouldn’t be super thrilled about spending 4 hours behind the wheel just to take me to the work and back.So next day I texted her I won’t be giving her rides anymore. I still drive the auto car bc in the manual car a part broke and it needs to be delivered from overseas so it takes time. I won’t deny that maybe it was an overreaction on my part. But I feel hurt by her comment and also I don’t want to go in her driveway again, hit the lawn and get yelled at again. I’m not losing anything if I refuse to give her rides. And I feel like she should’ve been more grateful. Anyway she was angry and called me a bitch. Our other coworker said I’m an asshole because the 40F really needs the rides. Now I think whether I was really an asshole. The 40F has a wild temper so she probably didn’t mean what she said. But it was still hurtful anyway.",

Her kids are 15m and 12m.Anyway for Christmas this year my husband(40m) got himself, both our children(14m and 13f), and myself each a steamdeck for Christmas. He and I have been enjoying ours and our kids have been glued to theirs. Naturally they took their new toys with them to grandma and Grandpas when we went to visit, like most kids do with new tablets and games.My sister lives with my parents because we'll frankly rent is too dam high for a single mom with two kids in this city. I can't blame her plus then mom and dad have someone close if there's an emergency.After we got done with our extended family Christmas my kids got out their steamdecks and started playing, and their cousins were playing on the new phones their grandparents got them.My sister had some sort of attitude once my kids got on their decks, saying how kids should be spending time with their grandparents on the holidays not their toys. Never mind that's what hers were doing.  A while later I guess my niblings started bothering my sister about how next birthday they wanted a steamdeck too. I guess this made her mad because she came into the kitchen where mom and I were making supper and started ranting at me about how we spoil our kids and how we should think how that will affect others and their kids and not raise ours to be entitled brats.I didn't quite understand what was happening nor did mom. Eventually she said she \"knew\" we only got our kids such expensive gifts to make her look bad and make her kid jealous because I \"always\" have to one up her after she does something.I kinda lost it and I told her to shut it, that my hubby and I just wanted to give out kids nice things, we couldn't care less if her or her kids are jealous or not. We are parents not competitors.It all kind of blew up from there. Mom says I may not have been in the wrong but it would be nice if I had my kids keep their things off of social media and away from my niblings so my sister doesn't have more \"melt downs\"Was I TA?",

She got 11/25 on an essay and everyone else in our small literature class(8 students) said it was her fault for not taking things seriously.

I told her about the past bullying and said that Leah is probably only being nice out of guilt and because I was nice to her when she needed it.Mom, though, got this idea that Leah liked me from the start and only realized it after I was nice to her. She insisted that girls bully boys they like. That was when I said she was crazy for this idea.

I actually like talking to her about her wedding!The issue that recently came up was that she was sharing with us about her honeymoon destination. It's a cute seaside city, and honestly, I thought it sounded great! I shared it with my husband, and we decided that we'd love to take a vacation like that too!Because of our itinerary, we decided to visit a different (but very similar) city in the same country (think San Diego vs. Santa Barbara if you're in America). When I came back from my trip, my coworkers were excited to see pictures and hear about the trip, and I shared some chocolates that I brought back as well.The entire time, my coworker was kind of icy, and I finally found out it was because she thought I stole her idea for a vacation. She said that since I've gone on a similar vacation, I've stolen the magic of coming back to talk to our coworkers about it. Even though it's a different place, she says it was similar enough and that it was kind of shitty for me to take the attention when she's been planning on her trip for a long time.I personally don't feel like I did anything wrong since we went to a different city and did different activities than what my coworker talked about (she likes sporty things like hiking whereas I visited museums and dined out more).

	"body" : "I (28F) was invited to my cousin’s wedding. It’s pretty a big deal in my family because Jake(28M) is the first in my family to get married. However I rejected the invite because his fiancé doesn’t like me.When we first met she kinda just glared at me. At first I thought it was just because she might be awkward meeting new people or it’s cause Amy(F30) is from aboard. But I think she just genuinely doesn’t like me. She always has made under minded comments about me. Whether it was about me being a single mom, dropping college and going back or even just what I eat, she makes these weird comments that I just brush off.Some examples of this during this past week:at a family party I was talking about my son having a parent event for his soccer club. I said I was a bit nervous participating and Amy told me well it’s your fault the dad isn’t in the picture to do so.I gain a lot of weight recently (30lbs) and Amy said I shouldn’t be ordering anything but soups and salads for the good of myself while at a resturantEarly this week Jake and Amy came over to invite my family and I to the wedding. After they left my sister tells me that she was asked to be a bridesmaid by Amy. I didn’t think anything of it and said congrats. But when my sister asked me if I was one, I said no. She look surprised. Apparently, Amy and Jake had all their siblings and cousins to be bridesmaids and groomsmen. I didn’t know, and I was honestly a little sad but I just said it’s whatever’s. My sister was mad on my behalf and went to complain to my parents and aunts.Long story short, this has started a fight between Jake and Amy vs my family. Jake’s mom was really angry that I wasn’t part of the bridal party. But Jake and Amy don’t want to me to be a bridesmaid cause I’m not a traditional woman. I thought it was getting too much so I just decided that I shouldn’t go. Am I sad? Yea, I’ll feel left out but it’s not my wedding and I don’t wanna fight with Jake or Amy about it. My family doesn’t want to go anymore but I said I’ll be fine they can go enjoy the wedding.Amy did reach out to me yesterday about it. She just said “Sorry I didn’t pick you as a bridesmaid because you don’t match my image I want a traditional wedding and you aren’t that” Then going on to how I would make the wedding pictures uneven.I just responded “I’m not going anymore. I don’t need your reasonings on whatever you think.” I thought this would make Amy happy but she wasn’t. She angry texted in all caps “FUCK YOU. I don’t even know why I consider inviting you. You should be regretting not coming.” Im not sure how to feel. But I’m not alone I was thinking of just going to the beach with my son that day just so I can distract myself. But my whole family all told me I should go to the wedding. I don’t really feel welcome and Jake hasn’t told me anything But AITA for letting this argument with the bride affect my present at her wedding?UPDATE (1/13/24)Hi everyone it’s been a few days. I have read all the comments and private messages sent to me. Thank you for your advice and personal stories. It did help me see clear of my situation.Also I think I need to clarify some things from my last post.My relationship with Jake is similar to having a childhood friend or having an older brother. We used to do everything together when we were younger. Even when I moved and had a kid Jake used to call or message me on how I was doing every once in a while. It was only when he started seeing Amy he became distant.My whole family has seen the messages Amy has sent me. I have a very small family so news gets around fast. I only have my dad’s 2 siblings and they’re like 4 cousins between all of us and my grandparents. We are very close and even have a family group chat. However they only want me to go just to keep some peace. My family has made it a point they don’t like Amy she says weird comments about everyone. But everyone loves Jake so they want to support him.I said that I would only update if something big happens and I guess this counts. But I was able to meet up with Jake. It was by accident, I bumped into him while at the grocery store.He came up to me while I picking out some bread and said hi. We awkwardly chatted a bit. The usual ‘how are yous’ etc. but then my stomach started to rumble. It was already 3:30 pm and I had not eaten all day. He started laughing at me and started I to hit him cause he started making fun of me. It was oddly nice, even tho he was making fun of me, it felt like I had my old friend.He invited me to our childhood restaurant for a late lunch and I said yes. We ate and just chatted like we did before when we were kids. It was such a nostalgic feeling talking to him without Amy.But of course he mentioned the elephant in room. “So you’re not gonna come to my wedding?” I couldn’t look at him so I just stared at my plate and said “ Amy doesn’t seem like she wants me there, and I want you to have a happy wedding. Even if that means I’m not there I want you to celebrate your wedding with Amy.”He couldn’t look at me either so he just stare outside the window. “ You’re not the first person to say something like this.” He then explain that Amy has been having similar experiences to many of Jake’s groomsmen, other friends, and his own sister. She wants a perfect wedding without flaws according to Jake. They had a big argument and Amy is now staying at a hotel near by to get away from Jake and his parents.He kept sighing the whole time. He covered his face with his hands and asked “Should I get married?” I was shocked Jake has always done everything for Amy these last 5 years he has never thought of himself before.I sighed and said “Everyone wants you to be happy. That’s why we supported you to be with Amy, cause we love you but if you’re not happy then we will still support you in whatever we can do. It’s your choice at the end of the day, but hey I’m not perfect with relationship either my baby daddy is god knows where”He just chuckled a little and said “I’m sorry, for how I’ve been treating you. I wanted to please and be supportive of Amy, but I ended up letting her say horrible things about you. I’m not a good best friend or cousin for letting you and everyone else experience that too.” I just hugged him and said “ if you want to have a wedding I’ll be happy for you, but if you decide not to I’ll probably be at the beach that day.”He laughed and said he’s gonna talk with Amy. He said he just wants to confirm somethings before he starts preparing for a wedding. He had a sad smilie on and we went our separate ways.In the last few days our (Jake and I) other friends started messaging me that they think it’s over for Amy and Jake. Jake went to talk with a lot of our friends and other family to talk about Amy’s behavior and apologize to them formally. I was a bit surprised how serious Jake is taking this just because he’s never done this before. He always kept quiet and just yes manned Amy for so long.I don’t know the situation with the wedding yet but I hope my cousin will feel better soon. Even Amy, I hope she realizes Jake’s feelings as well.",

I was uncomfortable but he assured me that he “loves me and only me”. We had a few fights over things his friends said but ultimately it was clear that we were being dumb.I didn’t have any problems related to Millie for several years. Everyone seemed to have moved on.Husband and I now have 3 kids. My middle son (6) is in the same grade as Millie’s son. They are in different classes and I only found out about this after my MIL passively mentioned it.The moms in my son’s class created a groupchat. A couple days ago Millie contacted me and asked if I could add her into this groupchat and said that she and her son are having trouble connecting with the other moms/kids and it would be a huge help. I was a bit confused as to why she was asking me for permission, and how she got my number but I quickly realized that the other moms probably told her and out of consideration for me wanted her to ask me? I’m not sure. Most of these women grew up with Millie so they know “everything.”I told her that I can’t really stop anyone if they wanted to add her but I’d rather she not join. Besides, it’s a class groupchat and her son isn’t in it.She got upset and asked if I’m only saying no because of her history with my husband. I said well yeah. She then said I’m being sensitive and petty. I told her that I’m uncomfortable. She said not everything is about me and I’m being selfish. I made a sarcastic comment about protecting my peace before firmly telling her she won’t change my mind and that neither she or her son are my responsibility. Millie got even angrier and said that I’m the only person still hung up over their relationship and that I need to grow up and stop being so insecure. She also accused me of being elitist?She’s still at it and will tell anyone that’ll listen about how I’m being selfish and how I’m so hung up over the past. My husband thinks we’re all being ridiculous. He was joking when he said that but idk. One of the moms in the groupchat privately asked me about the whole thing and she just said “hmm” so I really don’t know, but they said they weren’t going to add her unless I “gave my permission.” AITA?Edit:I understand that I’m the asshole. I do feel a little crazy but I can’t deny that I’m not uncomfortable no matter all the “you do realize he married you” comments. I’ll still let the other moms know that they can add her and not to let me stop them as I’m being a little silly.You can tell me that I did wrong without making assumptions and wishing things on me and my kids.

Sorry this update took so long, but I just signed the last of the divorce papers and wanted to share with this sub. I took the top comment's advice and tried to have a conversation with my ex-husband and his mother, but they both just yelled at me and would not listen to anything I said. My ex-husband even went back on his agreement to not invite her over -- apparently, this was my punishment for disobeying him and embarrassing his mother.For a few months, I stayed with my best friend on the weekends, and she convinced me to divorce him. But because I was a SAHM, I needed a steady source of income. Early 2023, we started a candle making business on Etsy. It was really rough the first few months, but we began to gain traction and I finally told my ex that I wanted a divorce after I felt financially stable. He said no, but I had already worked everything out with my lawyer. After I sent him the papers, he and his mother began harassing me and he said that he would agree to the divorce only if I gave up full custody of my daughter. Long story short, this ended up in us going to court, and I now have full custody.My best friend is the real hero of this entire story -- she let me stay over for free throughout the proceedings and helped me care for my daughter. With the alimony and the money I made from the candle making business, I officially moved in with my best friend and began paying her rent, too. I'm currently saving up to buy a place of my own. My daughter and I are really happy right now, and I can't believe that I didn't see how toxic my ex and his mother were for the 7 years we were married. I hope this is enough drama for the rest of my life, and thanks to all the people in my dm's who showed me how toxic my relationship was!",

	"body" : "My uncle does odd jobs around farms to make some money, and I'm a zoology student who needs some experience to start applying for vet/zoo internships in a year or two, so he agreed to take me along to help shear some alpacas.When we got in the barn there were around 60-70 alpacas in there. I noticed they all had a tight tubular \"mask\" on over their nose and mouth, like a thick sock. It looked pretty uncomfortable for them.My uncle explained that the owners had put \"spit masks\" / \"spit socks\" on all the alpacas before our arrival and it was a common thing, and something he requested all clients to do before an alpaca shearing.The goal is to deter them from spitting (since the spit will backfire) and to make sure you don't get spit on.Well, I didn't think that was a very good justification for something like that. It looked stifling and uncomfortable for them, and the only benefit is avoiding spit?During a break I checked on my phone and it said the only big problem with alpaca spit is that it can stink, it's not like it's harmful or anything. And they seemed well-behaved anyways. I was willing to risk a bit of spit to make the alpacas more comfortable.So while my uncle was shearing, I removed the spit-mask from a couple of alpacas without him noticing. When he noticed, he got really angry and said \"put those back on, what are you doing, do you want to be spit on?\"I said I wasn't too worried about it and I wanted what was best for the alpacas. He said \"you have no clue what you're talking about, put them back on now.\"I didn't see what the big deal was and said if anything it'd be me that got spat on from it, not him. He said \"I'm the one who has to drive you home, do you have any idea what that will be like if it spits on you?\"I didn't do it again but I feel like he was overreacting and it was sort of contentious the rest of the time. We didn't talk much on the ride home and I get the feeling he won't be inviting me to further farm days.It feels petty to me for him to be so worked up about me risking getting spit on (probably not even him) as if I couldn't clean up before driving home, I don't see what the big deal is.

	"body" : "I (39F) am originally from Türkiye but I have an American Husband (40M.) We have 1 child together, our son 15M.When my son was little, I would speak to him in Turkish in hopes of raising him bilingual. As a young kid, he learned quick and was fluent but as he grew older, he stopped “liking” Turkish. These aren’t my words, but my son’s. I thought this was just a dumb rebellion thing he would get over soon especially since he’s much closer with his non-Turkish speaking father than me. I was wrong. Going into his teen years he refused to utter anything in Turkish and I stopped pressing the issue.It wasn’t an issue I pressed because I felt that I didn’t need to. He can still communicate with his father and me. My son has never been to Türkiye and we live in a largely White, English speaking rural area in the Southern USA so it isn’t like he needed it for his daily life. My family back in Türkiye is pretty poor too so they never came to visit my family and teach my son to value the culture more. That is, until recently when my parents finally decided to visit my family in a surprise visit (my husband saved some money behind my back to help them with their travel expenses to surprise me.)It’s been amazing finally being able to see my parents after such a long time. My son has had some difficulties communicating with them, however. He can understand what my parents are saying to me 90% of the time but he is not able to speak Turkish to respond to them. My mom is the most frustrated with this. She will scold me for not pressing him as a kid to speak my language and scold my son for not being able to respond to it. It’s a daily thing at this point. My son was able to ignore it at first, now he’s just annoyed and so am I.I asked my mom to leave my son alone. Her frustration in not being able to communicate with her grandson is valid but she has no right to scold him for it. She can scold me all she wants over it, but leave my child alone. My mom, more upset at this point responded by saying that I can’t boss her around, she is my mother, and I have no right to boss her around. This led to a 10 minute long argument at the end of which, I let it die just to enjoy the fact in seeing my parents but I can still tell my mom is angry. AITA?",

I usually wouldn't fight more but since my parents are always babying my step brother because he has autism (which I have full respect for since my half brother has autism, they just use it as an excuse for EVERYTHING) I decided I wasn't going to back down since I had already clearly said I was going to be green and he can't ALWAYS get exactly what he want. So I stood my ground and said \"no, I'm green\". He then said he wasn't going to play and my response was just a simple \"okay.\" He then ran off to his room and cried. My step mother then scolded me and was like \"couldn't you just let him be green since he wanted it so bad?\" So am I the asshole or not?And I know that this probably sound ridiculous and like a \"kid problem\" but I always back down and let him have what he want since I know that it's usually not worth anything to fight him because our parents will take his side anyways. I just want to know if I overreacted and should have just let him be the green one.PS. If you guys are wondering since I mentioned his autism, no he isn't always the green one.

He also learned to say “Aloha” and found it fascinating that it sounds so similar to “Hola.” He is very proud of his new bilingual greeting skills. When our in public, shopping or at restaurants, he frequently greets people in Spanish instead of English to show off.Last week, we were out shopping. I was distracted searching the shelf for a particular item when another mom and boy about the same age, walked into the aisle. I didn’t realize it at the time but the other family was speaking Spanish. My son however definitely noticed and said, “Hola” to the other boy. The boy looked at my son with disgust and said, “That’s not funny.” Then quickly walked away.I understand how the other boy could have perceived this as mocking but I honestly don’t believe that was my sons intention. I don’t want to be rude or offensive or teach my son to be unintentionally. I have been feeling guilty about it ever since. I’m a bit nerospicy and have difficulty with social situations like this.

She got us tickets in the front of the second level for day one and I was able to get us good floor seats for day four. We are both University students. I babysit to earn money and once a week do some work for my uncle.Last week, the keyboard on my laptop stopped working just 6 weeks after my warranty expired. I took it to Apple and they said it needs to be replaced. It will cost about $1000 to fix it as it is out of warranty. For that, I might as well just pay a few hundred dollars more and buy a new one, as there are a couple of other issues with it, notably and annoying crack in the screen from when I tripped over holding it.I have decided to sell my floor ticket and just go the first day. I will get at least $2500 from selling it due to how close it is, more than enough to cover the laptop and the rest I can put into my savings account to have some savings handy in my account. This will be helpful for me for times where I need to babysit less because I am busy during exam period.My oldest sister is 10 years older and a lawyer. She was unable to get tickets. When she found out I am selling mine, she got angry I did not offer it to her for face value. Face value is not going to pay even half of a new laptop. She said I am being scummy by buying tickets to sell for more. That was not my intention. I'm upset to have to sell the ticket but our parents are not well off and I really need a working laptop for my studies. If the keyboard didn't stop working, I wouldn't be selling the ticket. I'm only doing it for necessity because I really need this laptop for university. She said I should get a cheaper brand than Apple instead of scalping but everything is interlinked with my iPhone & Apple calendar and I really don't like Windows OS and want to be stuck with it for years. I plan to buy extended warranty this time and keep it for 3 years if possible.I said if she buys me a new laptop with the extended warranty, she can have the ticket, but she refused it is unfair. So I plan to sell it. But she keeps putting up stories on instagram about how I am a trashy scammy scalper so IDK if I am being a jerk. I didn't buy the ticket with the intention of reselling it, I'm selling it because something crappy happened and I need the money for my studies.",

She always called me a “weirdo freak” and said I deserved the bullying I got at school because I was a such a dork. I stopped visiting Beth’s house because of Jill and didn’t see her again until Beth’s 18th birthday, where she told people that I was harassing her boyfriend (I’d literally said hello to him and that was it) because I was too ugly and weird to attract my own guy. Thankfully, she moved away not long after and I was just glad to be rid of her.Now: Beth and I arranged a dinner reservation with the other three in our group – Liz (33f), Kelly (34f) and Megan (34f). This was our first real chance to see each other in over two years, due to a number of reasons, and we were all looking forward for a chance to catch up.Beth offered to drove me and Kelly with her to the restaurant (since neither of us can drive and I have CFS and several types of chronic pain so travelling isn’t easy for me). We caught a bus to Beth’s flat together but it was Jill who answered the door which shocked us both. Beth hadn’t told us Jill was visiting, and we’d have appreciated a heads up since neither of us have good history with Jill.Still, we were polite. Kelly said hello and complimented Jill’s dress, and I said “Hi Jill, nice to see you, how have you been?”. Jill completely ignored Jelly and turned to me and said: “better than you, clearly, still a pale freak, aren’t you?”. I couldn’t help it and snapped at her that “at least I’m not a bitter hag still clinging to grudges I started with a 12 year old. Maybe it’s time you grew up a bit.”Jill immediately ran off screaming for Beth and said she’s “not taking us anywhere until that c**t apologises” which confused me and Kelly because why would she be taking us anywhere? That was when Beth came out and revealed her car was broken so Jill was meant to be driving us and I shouldn't have been cruel to her sister and “that’s just Jill’s humour”. Kelly called bullshit and said Jill is a bully and she only surprised I hadn’t snapped years ago and told me I’d better not apologise. I said I had no intention to. Beth said “well, you can make your own way to the restaurant then” and kicked us out.Kelly and I called Liz and Megan to update them and say we’d be running late since we now had to pay for a cab and they are split. Liz thought I should just apologise because Beth is siding with Jill and it would cut the tension, but Megan thought this was long overdue and Jill had it coming and Beth needs to accept her sister’s actions have consequences. In the end, I refused to apologise and we got a taxi, only to find out Beth was refusing to join us over what I said to Jill. This was a week ago, and Beth is now refusing to speak to any of us other than Liz, who told her she’s said I was at fault, until I apologise to her sister.

A week after I found out I was pregnant, I caught my now ex (24m, we'll call him Adam) cheating on me with his new girlfriend (25f, we'll call her Christine). Adam and I decided to split, but agreed that we would still co-parent.My pregnancy has been rough, since I'm still in college with a job and my parents are less than supportive, but Christine has made it so much worse.The two invite me for lunch every Wednesday to talk about the baby. Christine doesn't let me order what I want because it isn't good for the baby. So the red flags started off very slow and subtle, but they just got worse and worse.I told them what I had planned to name the baby girl. Christine told me is was one of the ugliest names she had ever heard. I explained that it was my great grandmother's name who had passed away the year prior and that she was the woman who inspired me most so I wanted to honor her. Christine keeps picking on the name and so I've thought about maybe changing it.There have been some other really strange things she has done (throwing herself a baby shower for MY baby without inviting me is also at the top), but that one probably hurt the most.Recently while at our weekly lunch, Adam and I were talking about the co-parenting deal. Christine said that she wouldn't take care of the baby since it wasn't hers. I snapped at her and asked why the hell was she constraining all the things I could and couldn't do. I probably wouldn't have been so pissed if Christine hadn't promised that she would love to watch her step-daughter, but she had.Christine and I went off on each other. During our argument, I said that it wouldn't really matter because Adam would probably cheat on her too and so she couldn't be the step-mom to our kid. Christine practically stormed off, with Adam following her. I felt pretty guilty because I find myself as a calm person and I hate getting angry at people.Now weeks later, Christine had told everyone in the town we live in. The majority of my friends have stopped talking to me and I don't really have any support. One of my good friends was Christine's younger brother and so he told all of our other friends.It's been a few weeks and I've been trying to contact both Christine and Adam, but they don't respond. I've concluded that I'm on my own now, but I keep wondering if this is all my fault. I can't help but feel horrible about what I said, the two seemed pretty happy and Christine was a lot better for Adam than I ever was. So there was no reason for me to say that about her. Can I even salvage my relationship or just cut them out of my life?The action I took was yelling at the step-mom of my child. I think I might be the asshole because she was really hurt and it was kind of petty of me to say that.",

On our return trip, the first plane we had to take had only 4 seats per row (2 on either side of the aisle), so the seating arrangement that we had would sit my girlfriend and her sister next to each other, and I would sit right behind them next to somebody else (or, if I was lucky, next to an empty seat!). My girlfriend's sister has a fear of flying, so my girlfriend had to sit next to her, and I was okay with sitting outside of their row. We booked these seats in advance.At the airport while we were at our gate waiting to board, literally about 5 minutes before boarding started, the gate agent called me up and told me that my assigned seat had been moved 9 rows up in order to accommodate a family that had to sit together. I was not asked beforehand at all if I wanted to move my seat, and when I got to the gate agent they already had a new boarding pass printed out for me.When I returned to my girlfriend and her sister to tell them that my seat had been moved, my girlfriend asked me why I didn't complain that they moved me and demand my original seat back, and I reply that I just didn't think to in the moment. She then tells me to go back up to the gate agent to complain, to which I say that I didn't want to, as the flight was going to be boarding very soon.I am not a confrontational person, my girlfriend knows that, as we have been dating for over a year. We had a tight connection after this flight (less than an hour), and the flight itself was rather short (also less than an hour), so I did not think it was that big of a deal to cause a scene or risk delaying the flight even by a moment, as I was nervous about missing the connection. Not to mention that I had only found out literally 5 minutes before boarding the plane.After this, my girlfriend got very mad at me, saying things like \"I don't know why you can't stand up for yourself\" and \"I'm pissed off that we have to sit in the back of the plane and we're not even sitting by each other\" (when I booked the flight, the back half of the plane was the only spot where all three of us could sit in close proximity, due to other seats being booked, etc; she and her sister okayed the arrangement before I booked the seats, and I did not foresee myself getting moved).After we boarded the plane, before takeoff, my girlfriend texted me \"the 'family' behind us is a couple. good job \", to which I replied \"they just told me it was a family\", to which she said \"mhm\".After the plane landed, my girlfriend didn't talk to me and seemed to ignore me for most of the rest of the day, even when I talked to her. I was seated next to her on our next flight which was much longer, and she barely talked to me or acknowledged me, which made me sad. I don't think it is fair that she is very mad at me for something that is outside of my control, but I just want a third party opinion on this if IATA.",

So when it was obvious that he had a dirty diaper, we pulled into a rest stop so that I could change his diaper. When I got the woman's bathroom there was only one stall that had a changing table, and it was the handicap stall. That stall was occupied, so I stood outside of the stall waiting for it to open up. Just as the stall became available, a woman in a wheelchair came into the bathroom and asked that I wait for her to use the bathroom before I use it since she is in a wheelchair. I had been waiting for about five minutes for the stall. My son had a dirty diaper that needed to be changed. He was crying and irritable at that point. I told the woman that, unfortunately, the only stall in this bathroom that has a changing table is the handicap stall and I have been waiting for five minutes to change my son. I told her that I would be quick, and I went into the stall to change his diaper. While I was in there, I overheard the woman telling anybody that she could interact with that I was being rude, and was discriminating against her for her disability, by taking the handicap bathroom from her. It took me about two minutes to change my child's diaper and then I left the stall so that she could use it. As I was leaving the stall, the woman said to me \" I hope you feel good about yourself, taking a handicap stall from somebody that actually needs it\". I reminded her that the handicap stall is also the only stall that accommodates babies with a changing table, and that I had every right to use the stall. She scoffed at me and went into the stall. I don't know why this interaction is bothering me so much. I don't think I was in the wrong. But here I am asking Reddit, AITAH for asking a handicapped woman to wait for me to change my child's diaper?Adding info for some, I didn't think this would blow up like it didYes, I know you can change a baby's diaper virtually anywhere. Our car was honestly not a great option as it was packed full. I could have changed him in the front seat, but I also had to use the bathroom so it made more sense to simply go to the restroom and use the resources there.My husband took our 3 year old to the restroom in the men's room. This is usually how we do it as 90% of the time there is no changing station for baby's in the men's restroom in the USShe did not express any urgency to me. Only that she should have the stall due to her disability. I know it's possible she was too embarrassed to tell me her urgency, this is something I will never know.No I don't use cloth diapers but I will look into this if it is something that will really help his rashes!",

Until then, virtual learning. I'm honestly just having a rough time with the lack of decompression time. The kids are simply more rambunctious than usual due to lack of stimulation and sitting at a computer screen for learning (same thing happened during COVID) but add a baby who is going through sleep regression, whom sleeps ALL day and is up quite literally all night and you get one tired mama who has zero down time.

So him touching me and trying to \"get a piece\" or trying to talk about our finances (which we already talk about when the kids are awake) is exhausting. Especially considering he gets down time. After the kids go to bed, he goes to his office to do whatever for 2-3 hours while I try to get the baby down (she's strictly breastfed). It's just that the second she is asleep, in his head it's like a \"oh, kids are all asleep, my turn to get attention\". Even if he sees that I've opened a book or put in headphones. And it's just getting increasingly frustrating because like I said, the baby is up all night and she's at an age where she wants me to be fully engaging with her (talking, holding, playing) or she gets fussy. So everyone here right now is just constantly begging for my attention, while I'm just begging for 30 minutes of being left alone. And like I said, my husband is fully aware of this. I've told him. He simply thinks it does not apply to him.So, last night I got the baby to bed around 9ish and my husband comes in and says \"wanna watch a movie\", so I said no and that I wanted to read but he could watch the movie beside me so we are still together or whatever. But he kept making comments. \"Babe, you don't even want to watch this? It's funny.\" Or \"did you see that?\" (And then proceeds to rewind the movie so I can see even though I said I didn't want to) and lastly the \"you don't even wanna give me that butt?\" At this point I'm fuming mad because I haven't made it through 2 pages uninterrupted and I snapped. I said \"will you just leave me alone? Why do I have to keep repeating myself to you?\" He turns off the movie and storms off to the office, while saying \"I just wanted to fucking hang out with you\" and now I feel bad but I need to be left alone for once.eta: he does his part around the house. he helps clean, helps with dinners and is usually the one who drives the kids to and from their sports. this isn't about what he does and doesn't do to pull his weight. it's only about me not getting any down time because he, much like the kids, want my undivided attention. we do still hang out together. we literally watch a movie together every single night. but on the nights that I don't want to do that, he sits and basically begs for my attention, even when I've voiced that I want to do my own thing.",

Recently, my daughter and the Ron were hanging out with a friend, and they walked into our house as they left their friend's place. This is where the problem occured.My son, who was at home with me, let out a big sigh after seeing Ron and asked why he was here. I was confused by what he meant. That's when my son vented about being tired of the Ron's constant presence and made hurtful comments about his sexuality(Ron is gay). It was shocking because my son had never expressed any issues with the neighbor before and had always been close to him.Ron was visibly hurt and offered to leave, but I insisted he stay but he said It was okay and left anyway. My daughter and I were rightfully upset and I admit we were yelling. I asked what his problem was. He yelled back saying he couldn't help not wanting to be around the Ron all the time.I tried being calm, asking my son why would he say something like that to Ron. At this point, my daughter had already left and went with Ron. My son refused to answer me and just kept saying he was sorry. I told him I'm not the one to be saying sorry too. I told him I raised him better than this and this made him cry.In the heat of the moment, I made the decision to ground my son. I took away his phone, PS5, and all his electronics, leaving him with only the TV in his room without the remote. He started crying even more and begged me not to go through with it, but I stood firm, telling him he needed to apologize to  Ron the next morning.Now, I'm conflicted. My daughter supports my decision but when I spoke to Ron, he suggested I let it go assuring me he would be okay. I think he might be right, I tried talking to my son again, but he is straight up refusing to talk to me and keep saying please leave him alone in a quiet tone. I don't think I'm in the wrong for grounding my son, but I'm wondering if I went too far, considering it's his first time saying something like this.Am I the Asshole for the way I grounded him?",

	"body" : "My MIL is a good woman, make no mistakes. I'm not trying to paint her in a bad light here. I do love her but I'm so resentful of her that it's clouding my brain. She has this overwhelming desire to feel needed and comes over here whenever she finds out any of us are ill. Even if we tell her no, she will still show up. And like... She doesn't help. That's the thing. She comes here with a can of chicken noodle soup and then stands in front of our TV or tries endlessly to get us to talk to her, knowing I have zero energy to entertain. Even when my husband and I had COVID. He told her and she showed up here and despite seeing that we were trying to rest, still attempted to get us to drink coffee with her and hang out in the kitchen. When we tell her to leave, it's always met with a \"I will be fine\" (thinking we are telling her to leave for her safety, which isn't the case 9 times out of 10). And it's happened so damn frequently (my husband has a weak immune system) that I don't want her here half the time, even on a good day.We now have a 4 month old daughter. But Little Miss is feeling a bit under the weather (just a cold- she's been seen by her pediatrician). My husband gets a phone call from his mom earlier and he ends up telling her that the baby is a bit sick. After he gets off the phone I tell him that she had better not come here (him and I have discussed this in the past so he's fully aware how irritated it makes me when she shows up here while we are ill). He said \"well she said she was going to swing by\". I told him to call her back and tell her not to come and that I don't want her here. I told him to blame me. So, he did call her but he walked out of the room so I didn't hear the conversation. Next thing I know she's knocking on the door. He answers and says \"I told you you didn't have to come\" and she says \"I know but I figured I'm needed\". As soon as I heard this I honestly just started dressing the baby and packing an overnight bag. She comes in to the room and says \"where ya going?\" So I said \"to a hotel\" and pushed past her with the baby. She DOES know that I don't want her here when we are sick because I've told her that I don't want ANYONE here when we are sick, so it shouldn't have come as any surprise. Both my husband and MIL started protesting but I didn't even catch what they said. I just took off. My husband has been texting me ever since, saying I overreacted and that his mom simply wants to help but I argue that I truly don't need her \"help\", which consists of her just taking up my space and energy. I also didn't need her fussing over my already sick baby and getting her even more sick because she should be resting. I won't come home, despite him asking me to and I also said he either tells her she's no longer welcome here when we are sick or I will have to make a decision on whether or not I want to deal with this going forward because it may not look like a big deal but it is to me. He says he \"can't believe how largely I'm blowing this out of proportion\". AITA?ETA: the bizarre bit of this is that my husband is not close to his mom. It seems like he is from the post but he's not. She was barely around during his childhood (he was raised by his sister). So she calls him like once a week and the conversation lasts maybe 5 minutes and it consists of \"how is everyone\" and that's it. When she comes here, HE gets awkward and clams up and they barely say 2 words to each other. He also word vomits due to awkwardness and over shares our finances with her too, just to have something to talk about. He acts super weird around her. So when she comes here, she's usually up my ass and it's me who's entertaining. I think she only comes by when we are sick because she feels like a shit mom for not being around for his childhood and now she tries making up for it.",

I’ve been wanting to reply to so many of you but I’ve been increasingly more unwell as the day goes on. I had to log off work early just to recover so seeing the validation and reassurance is unbelievably relieving. My boss is also letting me take a day or two off if I need. I work from home for obvious reasons but I might take her up on it as I’ve been so low energy.Just to note, John is already in therapy and while I can’t find the person who made the comment, I will not be reaching out to his therapist but instead finding one for us or asking if I can join him with his. I didn’t realize it could come off as me being sneaky and I don’t want to add more crazy to this circus.The only thing he’s said to me is letting me know that a package has arrived for me. I said to put it aside and he just left a thumbs up emoji. According to my neighbor/friend he bumped into John and John said he took the day off. The only reason I know this is because my neighbor (who wasn’t there when it happened) asked if I was okay. John said that he hopes so and that I wasn’t there before ending the conversation. They reached out to me and I let them know I was fine but didn’t go into details.I don’t really know how to update this if anything happens later on this week but I’ll look it up. I have a feeling I’ll need people to talk to and right now, I have only my friend who is insisting I go straight to moving out.Someone also mentioned possibly showing him this thread and I am actually considering it. We both keep our circle small for different reasons so having an outside opinion might help.Thank you again and hopefully I have something better to update you all with.—I (29f) am married to “John”(29m)(3yrs married dated for 7yrs). Without going into too much detail I have multiple disabilities that leave me needing a wheelchair on occasion. Its genetic so I decided early in life that I didnt want to have kids because of it. I dont want to pass it on and it would be a huge risk to my body. My mom passed away when I was born and she also had it. John has always understood/agreed as he never saw himself as a dad. He and his brothers went into foster care due to his parents substance abuse. They were found alone fending for themselves.Hes not sure about his father but his mother is back in his life after being clean for the past two years. Im happy for her as it is a huge problem in our state and not easy. My MIL has always been quirky but sometimes makes comments about my disabilities.Recently she has been asking when we were having kids as she is desperate to be a grandma. I explained my side multiple times. John has also explained his side how he has always said no to kids and that we spoke about it multiple times before marriage. Lately she has been very persistent which I ignored.On NYE we had a small party and since it was my own home I didnt need to use my chair. My MIL came and when she saw me was visibly upset. Shes mostly seen me in a chair (especially in the winter time as it can affect me more) and said that seeing me out of my chair surprised her. Again I ignored it its something Im used to.In my friend group we do a NYE wish and share it out loud. When it was my MILs turn her exact words were “I wish for (my name) to finally put John first and give him the family he deserves” and I froze. When I asked why she would say that she said that she felt that I was lying to John about my illness and faking it to avoid giving him a kid and called me a bad wife.I explained that I could pass away like my mom did and she said that it happens and if it did that she would take care of the baby. I admit that I was impulsive but hearing her be so casual about it made me rage especially since John wasnt intervening. Apparently she and John had been speaking about it as she believes he has to pass on his legacy and that Im holding him back.I f*king lost it. I said “theres no legacy to pass. You chose drugs over your kids and then left them. Even if there was a chance of me having kids I wouldnt leave them to a drug addict that thinks my kids are there for her to try again” stormed out of the room and I went to bed crying.Yesterday John said that he had been reconsidering the idea of kids because he wanted to be a better dad than his. I told him that if it was important that we could talk about fostering/adopting but he said MIL said they wouldnt be blood related so it didnt count. He and a few of my friends think I took it too far and while I somewhat agree I also feel like the idea of putting my life at risk because she wants a redo shouldnt be so casually glossed over.AITA?",

I never saw him as a father figure, never saw him as a stepdad (meaning not a parent). I get along with him fine and he's a nice guy but that's about it. My brother (30m) never lived with him.My brother got married in 2019 and my mom walked him down the aisle opposite his wife and her parents. Mom's husband was waiting for mom in their seats. He did not include her husband in the wedding as a parent because he wasn't one to my brother. This is something that upset mom's husband and I only learned this a few months ago when I got engaged.How I learned this is my mom and her husband mentioned that he was hoping I would ask him or both of them to walk me down the aisle. I chose to ask my (paternal) granny. I chose not to ask mom because she and I had a less close relationship than she and my brother did growing up. My granny is the person who gave me the support I needed. My mom's husband told me it had really hurt to be publicly declared not a parent or parent figure when he has always thought of us as his kids in some way.I asked him if a special dance with mom or walking down the aisle with mom would make him feel better and he said no. He said he didn't want to be just something to mom but to be publicly acknowledged as a father figure. I told him he's not a father figure to me and I'm sorry that he wants to be but it's not how I see him. I asked him if there was something else he would like to do and he said he wanted to walk me down the aisle or perform a father/daughter dance. I told him neither of those were an option. But if he wanted to do something else we could discuss it.He and mom both mentioned it over the last few months and now my wedding is closing in on us and my mom told me I should have given him an actual role as a parent of the bride. She said it's breaking his heart to know he only gets to be her husband and not a fatherly figure. She asked me if they paid for the wedding, if I would change my mind and I said no. She asked how much they would have to contribute to the wedding for him to get the role as father of the bride and I told her no amount. He then asked me why I didn't want him to fill the role when he's the only father figure I ever knew (my dad died when I was 2). When I spoke to him he told me I was just being cruel and to have both of us reject him as a father figure stung.AITA?",

I was excited because we have no days off together and this meant we would have a little more evening time, assuming he was off at 5 like her keeps saying. I got home at 5:30 only to find out he was still at work. So I called and asked what time he was off. He flipped out and said 5. I said then why are you still at work? He said because he has to close the office, pick up stuff, close the gate, etc. I said then you're still working, so when are you off so I know when you'll be home? I was looking for a answer that would set up realistic expectations going forward. Like \"I have to do x, y, and z but I can't do that until 5 so 5:30 is a more realistic time to say I'm off.\" Pretty much we argued back and forth for a minute with me insisting if he's off at 5 then it's not crazy to expect him home by 5:30 and him arguing that he is off at 5 and he's just locking up for 30 min to an hour. He then asked me if I'm off 6 why I don't get home until 7. I said because my commute is an hour, but I still leave at six.  He keeps insisting this is the same logic. He ended up getting home at 6 and has been ignoring me for an hour and a half because he's busy with his game and insists I need to apologize for asking him what time he is off again. Which I did, and tried to explain that I keep expecting him home based off what he told me and keep getting disappointed. Which just started another argument.So AITA for thinking he should be home 15 to 30 min after he's \"off.\" I could be because maybe I should have just asked what time he was getting home instead of what time he is off again. I'm just tired of being told one thing and then something else happening.Edit: Phew... A lot of you are weirdly triggered by this.  I can see how my post comes across as me being wildly unhinged but I wasn't even the slightest bit upset until he blew up at me when my intention was to just figure out what was going on and I did not do a good job of communicating that to him.Regardless, I apologized for asking him what time he was off hours ago and for not understanding that he had a completely different interpretation of the question than I did. I kept all attempts to explain where I was coming from to myself. And because I have not attempted to talk out the miscommunication  again he is happily talking to me instead of ignoring me.",

Using mobile so sorry if the formatting is weird.My (f17) parents have been divorced for 12 years, I've spent equal time at their houses since. 7 years ago, mum started dating Gary (m40s, fake name). Ever since they started dating I've never liked him. We  butt heads, he gets enjoyment out of making people angry, and Gary has taken his anger out on me. One time, he called me an a-hole and blamed me for his and my mums temporary breakup (I was 11). He blamed me because I first expressed discomfort about him to my mum. Ever since, I've felt fear of being myself or expressing anything but fake happiness around him.Since 2020, my mum and siblings moved into Gary's house and it's only made the tension worse. The times when I haven't taken his bait and not react to his inflammatory comments, he's called me a miserable asshole. But if I stand up to him or question him, he threatens me with kicking me out because I'm ungrateful. I hate living with him, I lock myself in my room to avoid him during weekends. I don't know how to act around him.My dad knows how I feel about Gary. Before we moved in with him, dad and I made a deal to try get along with him. For the most part I just smiled and nodded, only speaking when spoken to. I find it so hard to even \"try\" to get along with him when I know he likes to try make me upset. Anytime I've slipped up and spoken up, dad's told me to keep trying to keep the peace. I've thought about being at my dads more to avoid Gary.Here's the incident that's tipped me over the edge lately. For context, there's a rule at our house about food stealing, if it has someone else's name, you aren't allowed to eat it. A rule Gary made. I had a packet of chocolate in the fridge which he saw me write my name on it. One day, I go to have some chocolate and I saw there was less chocolate in the packet than when I left with. Gary grins at me and said \"that was some good chocolate RamenNoodles\" I was stunned for a second. This is where I might be an a-hole. I snapped \"You broke your own rule, Gary. My name was on the packet. What gives?\" Gary snapped back \"Well, I never made that rule.\" My mum (who was in the vicinity) said \"Yes, you were the one who made the rule\". Gary pulled out some snacks from the pantry. He basically said \"Well I buy all this food for you, should I label it too? If you can't share yourself then you're so overdramatic, honestly.\" Then he left.I was flabbergasted. My sister later said he labelled all the snacks in the pantry and fridge with my siblings names, but not mine. I don't care about him eating my chocolate, I care about how he can't apologise and plays immature games. I'm sick of constantly feeling like I'm playing a character too scared to speak out. I want to spend more time at my dads house away from Gary because of stuff like this. WIBTA if I admitted this?Edit to add: My dad has been friends with Gary for 15+ years",

My relationship with Lisa's rocky - not for typical stepkid stuff, but she stirs up issues, is outright mean at times, confrontational, etc. I've spent my adult life trying to preserve the peace and kept most of this under wraps from Joe as I didn't want to add gas to the fire.After a few years and more issues with Lisa, we addressed it with Joe and he agreed that it was problematic. Her behavior is well-known and discussed amongst her four children, their friend circle and extended family, so it's no secret and we've witnessed it fracture their relationships over time.Examples: Lisa got caught by a friend turning a framed photo of my mother and I displayed in memorandum at our wedding facedown (more than once, so not an accident), \"losing\" the keys to my mom's car that we needed to sell upon her passing, repeatedly introducing herself to people at our wedding shower as my mother (deceased less than a year prior), insults to me, husband, inlaws, you name it.While my mom's side of the family's has always gathered on Christmas day, I've hosted them at my home the past few years - we're not super close, but it's the one day out of 365 we spend together and it's a nice way to remember my mom while preserving the relationships with family on her side.In the past few years, Joe's attended my mom's family Christmas as he was their family as well for the 20+ years they were married. While there was a bit of bad blood in the divorce, the family has let go of animosity toward Joe. They are not a fan of Lisa - mom despised Lisa and they're aware of the issues Lisa's caused.Christmas: Joe messaged my husband and asked if Lisa could come to my mom's family's celebration at our home.My husband (43M) politely said that it wouldn't be well received if she attended. Joe said \"that's disappointing.\" We moved forward with the typical Christmas plan; nothing else was said about her coming.Welp, Lisa shows up on Christmas day, right in the middle of the gathering. She let herself in, walked up to my husband and said \"I'm here to make my presence known.\" My husband looked at her (wordless), then she asked \"Am I welcome here?\" He simply said \"no.\" She turned around and left.Joe is throwing a FIT. Called my husband and berated him over \"denying her entry,\" criticized his character, shamed him...you name it, it's been said via phone, text, and now emails.

I won't get into any detail, but he struggles with being around strangers and by that a mean if he has to talk to the delivery man he will have a panic attack, the only people he's okay being around is family members he knew ever since he was a kid including me and his fiance (26M) but even with that if there's more than 3 of us he'll have a panic attack. This is something my entire family is concerned about and yes, he's getting therapy and help for this, he knows this is a problem and he's dealing with it like a champ. Onto the actual story. I got married a few months ago, my family comes from the cacusaus mountains and even though we now live in the us and my husband's family is off different origin my family arranged a huge wedding. It basically went as is during the actual wedding ceremony they'd only be close friends and family members but during the feast/party after the vows All the guests would arrive. We knew my brother wouldn't be able to handle the party part so he'd only he attending the more secluded Wedding ceremony. My brother was ecstatic for my wedding and thought he'd be able to attend the ceremony since he had been doing great in therapy. But a few hours before the wedding my brothers fiance called me saying my brother was extremely nervous and probably if he even set foot in that wedding ceremony he'd have a panic attack, he basically asked me something along the lines off \"is it okay if he's high during the wedding?\" (My brother has a medical card for marijuana for stuff like this). Though I was upset I knew it wasn't my brothers fault so I said aslong as he didn't smell like weed it would be fine. During the wedding ceremony he thankfully didn't smell like weed but was very calm and was even able to attend the party. he didn't necessarily seem high either, He didn't really talk to anyone to no one noticed. But this was also his first time meeting my husband and he was ashamed that he literally had to be high to meet his brother in law, so I didn't tell my husband about it, I knew my brother would be ashamed and embarrassing and it wasn't my place to say anything, but my mom did know. A few days ago while we were talking she (my mother) cracked a joke about it Infront of my husband. My husband was confused and my mom straight up told him about my brother being high at my wedding.After my mom left my husband was pissed with me, he didn't mind that my brother was high at all, if that's what he needed to do he didn't mind, he's angry at me because I didn't tell him and that I even though he'd judge my brother in the first place.

I was pretty excited to go until I was told that it would be too expensive for both of us to go, so she’s going by herself. That’s all fine except that it isn’t.You see, when we got married we didn’t get a chance to do a honeymoon, so we decided that we would do a big trip for our 10 year without the kids…right kids, we have two. Our 10 year is approaching in a few months. Well, after being invited to this wedding (taking place way later in the year) my wife said that we aren’t going to do our trip cause she has to save money for the trip to the wedding. I’m even more upset about it, and I voiced my opinion. Hold on to your hats folks I’m not done.The wedding is supposed to be on a Sunday so I naturally assume she’d be gone for maybe 4 days. Nope! I guess if you’re going to the UK you might as well take a vacation and site see for 12 days! No wonder it would be too expensive. Btw, at no point was any of this planning discussed with me. So finally I gave my full opinion especially with the new information. I (34m) stated that I was upset about this, bothered that I was never talked to about this wedding trip was now going to be a vacation with a wedding sprinkled in, and furthermore to move around my work schedule for the kids.

The response was no it would be too expensive and who would take care of the kids? So I didn’t go.And some final info: we share an account so it’s not like we have our own money set aside.

I won't get into the details of this argument, because I accept the bulk of the culpability for it and it's not the point of this AITA question. It is probably worth noting for context that there has been simmering tension between me and my wife lately, to the point she brought up if it would make sense for us to take time apart.When I arrived home, I concluded it would be best for me to leave the apartment for the rest of SIL's stay, which had another 48 hours remaining as her flight could not be changed. We're in a 1BR NYC apartment (with SIL staying in our living room) so it's impossible not to be in each other's face all the time. I believed SIL would feel uncomfortable due to the tension and my continued presence would effectively force her out of our place, which I considered would be unfair to her. Besides, SIL is currently a grad student living off a student loan with a ridiculously high interest rate and she would be paying exorbitant hotel rates in NYC during New Year's Eve weekend, whereas I have enough credit card points to make the out-of-pocket expenses a minimal consideration.Therefore, I texted my wife as follows:\"I'm leaving the house at 9pm and plan to return on Jan 1. Let's talk in person then. Your sister is welcome to stay until then.\"At 8:45pm, I had finished packing my overnight bag when, to my surprise, my wife and SIL arrived at the apartment. SIL accused me of being extremely rude, taking particular umbrage with the last sentence of my text.\"Well, I said that out of consideration for you. I admit I am at fault for this fight with your sister, so I was merely offering to minimize the inconvenience to you, our guest, by my leaving instead,\" I responded.SIL declared, \"I'm an adult and you do not tell me whether to stay or leave!\" With that, SIL grabbed her things and ventured off into the December night, a single woman with no plans in a city she is unfamiliar with, which is exactly what I feared and had tried to prevent.My wife is now mad at me for giving SIL no option but to leave by saying she is welcome to stay. I'm baffled because it was intended to be anything but that.AITA for this sentence? I could have handled the situation better overall but the sisters are convinced that my saying SIL is welcome to stay is the chief offense of all.A second, related AITA question: After SIL exited, I wondered out aloud to my wife, \"Well, should I at least offer to book your sister a hotel room?\" But since SIL had left to make the point that she is an independent woman, I did not pursue this option further and now my wife is also angry about this.AITA for not reaching out to SIL and offering to book her a hotel room?ETA: See comment for context of original argument.",

This last term she came down with mono and then Covid and missed a lot of school.  We were coming to the end of the term and her English teacher wouldn’t work with us on waiving some of the assignments she missed because of her illnesses. One of the assignments she was missing was a short story about a dystopian society. Because of her dyslexia, she has a hard time putting her thoughts in her head onto paper. We have helped her many times by having her verbally talk out the assignment and then help her write the sentences. The ideas and plot were hers, but the actual text was a combination of mine and hers. So obviously it had good grammar and punctuation compared to her normal writing style. The end of the term was right before Christmas break and she turned in the short story the day the term ended. I emailed her English teacher explaining how she struggles putting words on paper and I helped her with the story but the idea and plot was hers. She was pretty happy with the story and it made me happy to help her realize that she can write a good story. That afternoon, we got an email from her teacher saying that he ran the story through an AI detection software and it was flagged as written by AI and my daughter had cheated and was getting a zero. He also claimed he discussed it with other teachers and the school administration and they all agreed it was cheating. I was so pissed off. I immediately emailed him back reminding him of the email I sent earlier and it wasn’t written by AI. But the teacher had left for Christmas break and didn’t respond. I spent the days of Christmas break stewing about this. I started testing the AI detection software they use and it was easily tricked. I would write paragraphs of text or copy letters to the editor into the AI detector and it would flag them as written by AI. I then asked ChatGPT to explain how AI detectors work and ran it through the AI detector and it came back as written by human. Clearly this AI detector that claims 99% accuracy is full of crap. I even contacted a lawyer to see what I could do if the school wouldn’t back down. The day before school restarted, I noticed the teacher changed the grade from a 0 to a more accurate grade. He didn’t contact me to apologize for calling her a cheater. So when school restarted, I told my daughter to not attend his class.AITA for not letting her attend the English class with this teacher?

	"body" : "I (f late 20s) am the oldest and only girl of 5 siblings.I babysat my brothers growing up, but I wasn't allowed to discipline them in any way. As a result, my brothers fought, hurt each other, broke things, ate food my mom was saving for dinner, etc. I was blamed for all of this and punished. My dad frequently told me to \"treat them like your own sons.\" One of my brothers was special needs, meaning medical emergencies could happen at any time. I wasn't always sure of what to do and my parents weren't always easy to get ahold of. I was also volun-told to babysit for my mom's friends for free. They would always stay out about 3 hours late and I'd be home after midnight. Because of all of these things, I made a choice as an adult to never babysit ever again. I have severe anxiety that I've been in therapy for, coming from my teenage years due to balancing school, work, extracurriculars, and babysitting and feeling like I had no help or comfort in any of my family members. On Christmas: the topic of kids and babysitting came up when someone asked  if birth order affected personality. There was some back and forth, but I said I think it does. When I was questioned about my reasoning, I just said that I had to be responsible in different ways than they had to. I was told I was being dramatic, then was pushed for more. I asked my youngest brother if he ever had to be responsible for younger siblings, and he, of course said no. I said that babysitting them put a lot of responsibility on me that I didn't consider appropriate for my age and maturity level, and that they'd never had to go through that. I also explained that I had to go without a lot of our parents' attention so they could have it (example: they missed my fencing tournaments and orchestra concerts to go watch my brothers' wrestling practices). After all of that, everyone was quiet, until my dad said, \"So you don't believe in family responsibility?\" I explained that I do, but that that there was a point where the amount of responsibility wasn't appropriate for one kid to handle. I also said that I don't think kids should be forced to babysit their siblings because it creates an unhealthy dynamic between them. My dad responded with, \"I didn't have to feed you or keep you in the house.\" I asked him what he thought would happen if he didn't do those things for me as a kid? He said, \"I'd have a skinny, cold kid.\" For more context, aside from my wedding and $300 for rent one time, I never asked for anything from my parents after I left at 18. I thought about asking what he thought was his responsibility as a father, but I realized he wasn't taking me seriously, so I dropped the topic. I was told I was being ridiculous, and that I should let things from the past go. I'm wondering if I'm TA because my parents did need a lot of help with their kids growing up, especially with my special needs brother. I do also believe in responsibility to one's family, but clearly my line is different from theirs. AITA?",

Many of her friends had only known me through her. I finally got to meet some of them in person at a potluck and, of course, used my legal name when introducing myself but otherwise didn't say anything.Eventually, my little cousin asked why they kept calling me a girl when I wasn't one. They asked what she meant, and my sister spoke up and told them I wasn't a girl and that the name they used wasn't my legal name anymore. After some more questions, she told them about me being born intersex and that I'd never been a girl.Some of them came over to ask me, and I confirmed it.

She chose to call me a liar and not believe the doctors because it would mean I wasn't the daughter she wanted and prayed for. They asked me why she called me a liar, and I explained that I had questioned my gender growing up because I never felt like a girl, but my mom always told me she would only ever believe in biology and not refer to me as anything other than what I was biologically born as.When doctors told her, without a doubt, that I was not born male or female and what was on my birth certificate was inaccurate, she said I was somehow making this all up and getting the doctors to \"believe my lies,\" despite the fact that they never knew I questioned my gender and that they determined it off a physical exam.

	"title" : "AITA for refusing to wear a dress to my mother’s wedding?",
	"body" : "Recently my family was sitting in the living room discussing plans for my mother and her new partner’s wedding. The wedding will not be any time soon as they are not yet engaged and are in poor financial condition. Still, they are both dreamers and like to talk about and make plans for things far into the future. Everything was going fine and the conversation was very pleasant. We discussed the typical things like what kind of flowers they would like, what season the wedding would be held in, and so on. Then we got to the topic of attire. My mother made it very clear that she would like her bridesmaids to wear short dresses with floral designs. She immediately looked towards me as she knew I would be against wearing a dress for multiple personal reasons. At first I thought she was going to say that of course I wouldn’t have to wear one and that we would find a matching alternative but she just kept staring. So I spoke up and said “I don’t want to wear a dress.” She went on to say how it was her dream wedding and that I would essentially ruin the vision. I listed off multiple alternatives such as a pantsuit, tuxedo, anything but a dress. I want to make it clear that I am willing to wear any color, pattern, design, etc, just not something that opens at the bottom like a dress or skirt. My mom’s happiness and her wedding are very important to me but I cannot shift my boundaries on this. My sister says that I’m stubborn and selfish. She says I should have no problem just wearing a dress for a few hours but I do. My family knows why I have this boundary and I thought they would be more understanding. AITA?",

	"body" : "My husband (40m) has been a snowboarder most of his life. He really wanted me (40f) to join him, so I agreed to try this season.I booked myself private lesson to ski and it went great. The following week my husband suggested a place with an easy trail. I agreed and he purchased my lift ticket and rental gear.We went and it was hard but fun. He was very supportive and stayed by my side while I skied  (and fell) down the hill.Today (4 days later) as he's leaving for work he asked when I would Venmo him for my ticket and gear. I was surprised because he had offered to buy my ticket. I paid for my first lesson and rental/lift ticket and I would have paid for this too, so I'm surprised he just didn't say something before.I told him I'm sorry, but I don't understand. He texted me and asked, should I get tickets for us? I thought since he offered, he was buying. He said he was buying it for me but, \"after opening my credit card bill this month, it would be helpful.\"We split our finances, but often treat one another and have never kept tabs before. I was a little pissed but whatever.Then a few hours later he sent a text with a copy of the receipt so I would see my portion of the bill. I guess it was a nudge, so I took the hint and Venmo'd $150 right away.Then he sent a text - \"umm it was actually  $150.99\".Dude, what the fuck?!? I said, you offered to pay, now you want me to pay for what I considered a gift. So I did, but you're going to be petty over 99 cents???It's been a few hours and he hasn't responded. So, am I the AH for assuming gifts are free?",

My daughter’s daycare is 20 mins each way, and as soon as I told my husband I still feel awful and am taking a sick day, he asked if I could drive her to daycare since I won’t be working.I get he’s still on today, but one of us drives her to school each day and we’re still working those days as well, so for him to immediately respond to me when I told him I still have a really high fever to drive her to school seems really callous to me, and I said that to him. He said it’s still a sick day, just drive her. Thoughts?*Edit: thanks everyone for the overwhelmingly NTA judgement. I ended up chugging NyQuil in front of him and passing out for a few hours, and he took that as a message to take her to school. To clear up a repeated question, I got sick from my daughter, who got sick from daycare and is now fully recovered, which is why she’s back at school. NY daycare is too expensive to keep her home for the entire duration of a daycare flu wreaking havoc through my household lol",

	"body" : "This incident happened Saturday and it was sort of a boiling point for me. But first some background. I (27F) married my husband Jay (27M) 2 years ago and we have been together for 8 years. Jay's older sister Mia (30F) and I have had a difficult relationship from the beginning. It seemed like we might get along well at first and be close because she seemed nice and we had some things in common. But she also made one or two jokes about my appearance that left me a little unsure. Jay told Mia she wasn't being kind and he would not tolerate her disrespecting me.She went out of her way to include me after that and introduced me to her friends and planning to hang out with me more. But she would often tense around me and would joke up and down that it was like hanging out with a teenager. This is because I look younger. Mia feels like she looks old and is very insecure about her appearance and her perceived age.For some time now Mia has told me I need to share my skincare routine and share the youthful secret. I have always told her the same thing. I have always been willing to share the few products I use. But I don't use much at all and I am honest about that. I have never been 100% faithful to a product either. If money is tight I go for whatever's cheap. But I do have my go to's. She has never believed me and it is frustrating.Onto Saturday night. Mia was celebrating her 30th birthday with the girls which meant her friends and some of the female family members she's close to and me. It was going fine until I got carded at the bar. Mia brought up how ridiculous it is for me to look like I'm 18 at 27 and how fucking lucky I am. Then she accused me of gatekeeping my secrets and not wanting others to have the same luck. Some of the family lightheartedly pointed out how frustrating it must be for me to have people doubt my age to the point of arguments sometimes, and yes this has happened a few times. Mia said I should share what I used. I was getting tired of her outburst at this point so I told them and even brought up pictures. Mia called me a compulsive liar and said I was selfish and spoiled and how I should learn to be a better family member and friend. She also brought up that I am trying to make her feel bad by \"always getting carded when I go out anywhere with her\". She accused me of being anti-woman/girl and being the worst kind of woman. I lost it at this point and told her just because she was insecure about aging and looking her age and not being 18 anymore didn't mean I had to sit there and take it. I told her she is a fucking 30 year old woman and to be proud she gets to celebrate aging instead of acting like a petulant child. I left straight after because I was so done. She was furious and has harassed Jay since telling him I was an asshole to her and I owe her an apology.He disagrees with Mia and told her as much. But I do feel bad. AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for grabbing someone’s service dog without permission?",
	"body" : "Okay, let me give you some context. I was staying at one of those beach resorts that have like 20 different floors with my family and our condo was on one of the highest floors. Something important to note was that the elevators were sketchy as hell (the doors shut really hard and fast with no warning and the sensor to see if something was still in the way of the door was really bad and didn’t respond to smaller things like your hand). Me and my siblings were heading down to the beach and a woman who was probably late 60s to early 70s got on a floor down from us. After a few seconds a really small dog followed her on. This dog had no leash, vest, harness, or even a collar. It was tiny so I wasn’t sure if the sensor would pick up on it, not to mention the dog was moving pretty slow. I panicked because she didn’t acknowledge it at all, so I assumed it slipped out of her condo without her realizing it. I thought the doors were gonna close on the dog, so I gently pushed it over the threshold by it’s butt. I just wanted to make sure her dog didn’t get hurt. It wasn’t the best way to deal with it in hindsight, but it was a split of the second decision. The woman freaked out when she saw and yelled at me for the minute long elevator ride, saying that it was her on duty service animal and I had no right to touch it. I’m physically disabled so I know the importance of never touching or distracting someone’s service animal. Had I known, I wouldn’t have ever touched her dog and probably would have put myself between the doors instead. My siblings told me that it wasn’t my fault and that she was just a Karen and that in that state a service animal on duty is required to wear a vest, but at the end of the day, I still touched someone’s service animal without permission and it bothers me to this day. AITA?EDIT: Yes, I’m aware I could have been bit, but I’d rather get bitten than watch a dog get crushed.There was a button to hold the elevator, but it was on the other side.I was mistaken about it needing to wear a vest to be considered “on duty”. I was going off what my sister in law said at the time. It was years ago so idk if the laws were different back then or if she just misread something when she looked it up.I didn’t have time to ask to touch the dog, because the last thing that I know set off the sensor was the woman and her dog was lagging several seconds behind so the doors could close at any second, otherwise I would obviously have asked.Yes, I have doubts that it was actually a service dog considering the fact that it obviously was lagging behind it’s owner. I lean towards it being an emotional support animal and not a service animal, but I don’t feel it’s my place to definitively say that.I mention that the dog was tiny because I didn’t think it would be big enough to set off the sensor, not because I don’t think small dogs can be service animals.I’ll add more notes if the discussion calls for it. Thank you guys for the feedback!",

	"title" : "AITA For Refusing To Pay For My Sister's Cruise",
	"body" : "My (19f) grandparents are celebrating 50 years of marriage this year and have invited the whole family to go with them on a cruise for a family reunion. That means all six of their children and their extended family (roughly 125 people) are going on a week-long vacation in March.I adore my grandparents but have a complicated relationship with my parents. In short, they're incredibly emotionally immature and care entirely too much about how they appear to others and not enough about how we as a family are functioning. Because of this, one of my older sister's, Brittany (20f), has fallen into addiction. Though I've tried my best to help her, without the support of my parents there's very little I can actually do.They told me it was my responsibility to take care of her, so when she lost everything after her DUI my senior year in high school, I completely rearranged my life to cater to her. I stayed home my first year of college and took her to and from all of her appointments, took her to work and school, etc. I sacrificed my life so that it looked like our family was functioning even though we weren't.Unfortunately with addiction, there's always the chance of relapse and my sister relapsed hard. She OD and I found her and had to rush her to the hospital. Still, my parents refused reasonable help. So, I stopped doing everything and decided to go to the school of my dreams and live my own life. After a week of having to actually parent, I got the \"apology\" call and the request to support her again. I denied them, and have 100% been independent since.Which brings us back to the cruise.Last week my parents called to inform me that I'm expected to go on this cruise and pay for everything myself- which is fine. I'm adult. However, I was not expecting to pay for Brittany. My parents said without reliable transportation, she's been unable to maintain a steady income and it's my fault for moving away, so it's reasonable for me to pay for her and have her pay me back. I told them no and asked why they couldn't. Turns out, in addition to paying for my younger sister Callie (16f), they've also decided to pay for my nieces (2f, 3f, 5f) and two step sisters (28f, 24f). I double downed- I'm paying for my own school and don't want to dip into my savings when I know I won't get paid back. But now I'm getting non-stop hate messages from the rest of the family. I don't think I'm being unreasonable, but with my grandparents are calling me begging me to go on the cruise and to just go ahead and pay for my sister, I'm waivering. AITA if I still refuse?TL/DR: My sister can't afford the family cruise due to a DUI, my parents told me I have to pay for her to go or risk embarrassing them in front of the rest of the family. I don't want to spend my savings, but they say if I don't do this I won't be allowed to go either. They're calling me an AH for putting my foot down.",

It was a matching piece with my mother, and we designed it together, so it was the first time when I confronted her about being hung up on me way too much. She didn't even consider it I think, because nothing changed, she would still show up to places where I was.After I graduated, we stopped talking to each other. I removed her on every social media page I could. But like a week ago, she found me on Instagram, and texted me that she was getting married, and she wanted me as her maid of honor, because I was her highschool best friend.At first, I explained kindly that I was in fact, not her highschool best friend, and I declined the offer. She kept pushing to a level where I just ghosted her. Later, she would post on Instagram story that I crushed her dreams, and my boyfriend thinks I was too harsh on her. I told him she was delusional to think that after almost 6 years of not talking to each other I would just be her maid of honor.",

	"body" : "I will start by saying as parents we should be able to gage our children's abilities and what programs are the best fit for them. We play on a competitive recreational indoor soccer league (during our non parks and rec off season). The Parks and Rec in our area offer two different forms of indoor soccer \"social\" being the least competitive and more about having a good time, being laid back & learning at a slower pace and  \"competitive\"... self explanatory. Our kids are 9-10 yrs old and really want to win! These girls fight hard and truly give it their all.One player on the team literally just runs around flailing her arms in the air. She does not know the rules of the game. She will drop to the ground on field and start throwing a fit if the other team scores a goal. Screaming \"we're going to lose!\". It's such a distraction to all of the players on the team. And even the opposing team gets so confused. They have her in the defender box most of the time and when it's time to defend and match up she shakes her hands in the other kids face or just runs the opposite direction. It's just hard to watch as a parent. Also a factor in this is we pay a few hundred in fees every season and some of us help sponsor as well. So we are invested in being competitive. This isn't professional soccer lol but we still take it pretty serious.I spoke with her mother recently who just laughed and giggled about the girls behavior. Calling it \"cute\" and how she's just having a good time out there. I did not pry into her medical history because that's none of my business. But the mom voluntarily shared that her daughter had ADHD and was thinking about medications. Personally I think there is something else going on with the kid, but again that part is none of my biz! I then suggested to the mom maybe the social league would be a better fit for her daughter, that what she was doing on the field and during practice was so distracting and counterproductive. That it was detrimental to the team and our chances of even making the playoffs. She snapped at me hardcore and said this is \"just little kids sports\" and it shouldn't matter at all to \"keep my fucking thoughts to myself\". Also that she won't go to the social league and how dare I even approach her with my opinion. Am I the asshole here??**Other parents and even the coaches have shown frustration.

	"body" : "My parents got married when I (16f) was 5 and my stepsister was 8. My mom brought me into the marriage and my dad (technically stepdad) brought my stepsister Rosie (19f) into the marriage. My parents had my younger siblings Angel (10f) and Jonah (8m) together. Both Rosie and I lost our other parents to death. My original dad died when I was only a baby and Rosie's mom died when she was 6.When my parents first got married and for a few years afterward I just said family and called Rosie my sister, dad my dad, etc. I never used step or anything. But Rosie did. She always called me her stepsister and made sure people knew that around her. She never called my mom anything other than her first name and she never gave her a family title. She was \"dad's wife\" to Rosie from day one and that has never changed.My parents were big on us all being one close knit family and while our late bio parents weren't hidden, an emphasis was put on how we were a family unit and while we might have some unique relationships (me with my bio paternal family and Rosie with her maternal family) we should always make sure we stay a solid unit and not be mean or think less of some people based on blood. Rosie did feel that way. I was never her sister and my mom was never her anything. She's closer to our siblings but they are still half for her.As a kid I was hurt by this and didn't understand Rosie at all. But then my best friend lost her dad when we were 9 and I remember when her mom was remarrying and she was so upset about it. Then we talked about it and it opened my eyes more to the difference when you remember the lost parent vs not, like me. I was maybe 12 when that talk happened and after that I saw Rosie and our family in a new light. I told her not long after that I was sorry if my pushiness when I was younger made her pain more painful.My parents have struggled more as the years went on with Rosie not getting on board with the family unit the way they wanted. It became such a hyper focus that they did virtual therapy with Rosie when we were all at home. They tried harder than ever to correct her use of half and step. Then a few days before Rosie turned 18 she moved out of state to live with her maternal grandparents. We don't see her as much now because of how bad things are between my parents and her. My siblings miss her and because my parents only get more annoyed at Rosie with time, I decided to have a heart to heart where I told them I understood where Rosie was coming from and that I thought they should focus less on the titles and put more into accepting the family we have so maybe, just maybe, Rosie wants to see us all more. And maybe we can all be happier just accepting how things really are.They really didn't like that I was telling them what to do. I also think my dad was kinda hurt that I had accepted Rosie's feelings on me and my place in her life. They said it was wrong for me to act like this is okay or that our family is healthy. AITA?",

	"body" : "Me (31F) and my husband (33M) have two kids (5M and 1F).My father (64M) is a serial cheater. For the last 20 years, most of his relationships have ended due to that. He goes through girlfriends like babies goes through diapers. While I'm not comfortable with that, my opinion doesn't matter. The women he dates are free to make their own choices.However, I do have two problems with this. The first is that the older my father gets, the less his relationships last. Since my son was born, he's introduced us to 8 different girlfriends, their time together lasting anywhere from 3 months to a year.The second problem is that my dad expects my kids to get attached to whatever woman he's dating. He invites them to go out with us, volunteers them as babysitters and talks them up to my son, usually to get him to want to spend time with them.For the first few years of his life, my son would spend weeks meeting my father's girlfriends and memorizing their features, only for them to vanish from his life a couple months later. Though it saddens me, he's gotten used to it.We're spending the holidays with our extended family, and my dad brought along his current girlfriend, \"Patty\" (36F). They've been together for two months, and my kids met her a week ago.Over this week, Patty has expressed her desire to get close to my kids. Both she and my dad have been trying to get my son to meet her properly. However, my father's routine isn't working this time: my son declines her invitations to play, doesn't interact with her much and hasn't seemingly made any effort to talk to her. He's not impolite, he just doesn't show any interest in her. My daughter is a bit shy, and doesn't seem to want to be around Patty either.After my son didn't acknowledge her at all during Christmas Eve, my father decided to confront me about it. He said he was disappointed in me, as Patty loves my kids and I'm not making any efforts to get them to love her back.It took me a while, but I lost my patience. I told him, \"they've known her for a week, she's almost their mom's age, and they'll probably never see her again after a couple months; why should they need to love your girlfriend?\"My father was pissed. He's accusing me of raising my kids to be selfish, impolite brats. We had a short fight about it, and he barely spoke to me during Christmas. He also texted me that \"Patty was upset\", so I can only assume he told her.My mom, as well as my aunt and cousins, think I did the right thing, and that he needed to hear it. My younger sister thinks I was too harsh, and that I should at least try to get my kids to meet Patty properly.I have nothing against Patty, but I don't want to force my kids to have a relationship with her.AITA?EDIT: I'm not sure if Patty knows about my dad's history of cheating. And I say they've been together for 2 months because that's when his last GF broke up with him; I'm pretty sure he was seeing Patty before that.Also, none of his GFs have ever actually babysat my kids.",

	"body" : "I desperately need outside perspective.I have been married to my husband Will for 3 years now, dated for 2.Before me, Will was married to his high school sweetheart Anna for 3 years. Tragically Anna died during the birth of their child, a little boy they named Damian.I met Will 3 years later. He was my older cousin's college friend. Will wasn't looking for a relationship but we somehow hit it off. I met Damian 2 months into making our relationship official.I love the little one with all my heart. And he is just the sweetest little man in the world. Always smiling and happy and polite. I would say I fell in love with Damian first and Will later.His parents and siblings were happy for Will and I and always thanked me for being there for Damian.Anna's family however, did not like me. They thought Will was moving too fast and that I wasn't a good influence on Damian. For context, I'm muslim and Anna's family are very strict Catholics.Their attitude towards me kept getting worse as Damian began getting more comfortable with me as a constant presence in his life. And because he was so young and Anna's family lived kind of far away, they weren't much of an influence in Damian's life. Will did take Damian to visit them once every month but as a young kid, he obviously preferred his dad and later me.I want to have kids later (in my 30s) so for much of his childhood, Damian will be my only kid of sorts. And as a result, we got really close and he started calling me mama.This enraged Anna's family as they felt like Will and I were trying to erase Anna from Damian's life. That wasn't true but you couldn't really explain the concept of a stepmother to a 5, 6 or 7 year old. Damian would get upset whenever someone said I wasn't his \"real\" mom and so I requested others to stop mentioning Anna until Damian was a little bit older.When I made this request, not only were Anna's faEmily members enraged but Will's siblings also agreed and said I was trying to take Anna's place and that it would be a very asshole thing to do.But I don't think I'm being cruel or mean by trying to be a good mother figure to Damian and think of his feelings. Like, Anna is gone but Damian is the one here right now. Shouldn't his feelings/thoughts matter more? Am I being manipulative in anyway? AITA?ETA: Thanks for all the feedback. If reddit taught me anything, it's that I won't ever be anywhere near Anna's place in Damian's life. I'll admit, hearing it from strangers made Will and Anna's families pov feel less vindictive, so at least now I know it's not personal.I've decided to talk with Damian today and ask him to stop referring to me by any maternal title. He has his entire family on both sides to help him feel close to his real mother and explain why she's not here and he's stuck with me. I have decided to ask Will to maybe take Damian to see a therapist and see why Anna's mentioning makes him so uncomfortable. Maybe his dad and professionals can make better sense of his feelings and deal with them better than I can.I had no issues being just \"Amy\" for nearly 5 years. I'll be fine with it for the rest of time.I'll call and apologize to the other family members too if Will wants that. I want to wash my hands off this mess as soon as possible.",

We used to text every day and meet once a week, but the frequency has decreased, making her feel neglected.She also told me that she feels that our friendship is becoming one-sided because it is now usually her taking the initiative to text me, but the fact is, I am going through a lot now, juggling between work, relationship and study. She put me on the spot, asking if the relationship has put her on a lower priority list. I admitted so because of the title 'girlfriend,' and she was hurt.I still love (platonically) and care about my best friend, and I wish she didn't ask this question as my answer might burn bridges. I understand her attachment due to our amazing times together and the challenges we faced in college, and we were always there for each other (she sees me as a brother and I see her as a sister).It seems she feels betrayed by my new relationship, and me admitting that my girlfriend is a higher priority has worsened the situation as she has stopped texting me. I wouldn't have shared that if she hadn't asked. I feel that she may be overthinking about this friendship situation, just because I prioritize my gf over her doesn't mean I don't care about her, I will always care about my dear friend.

My dad was his stepdad but my brother and dad were not close and when our mom died several years ago my brother chose to finish high school at our grandparents house and not live with dad and me. My dad remarried a year after mom died and my stepmom has a daughter who is 3 years younger than me and then I have two half siblings from them.My brother is still a very big part of my life. I see him all the time. I go to his house whenever I can. I make sure I see him every Christmas no matter what else is going on. He's the family I will always prioritize and he has been great to me. If I could live with him easily, I would.My dad and stepmom don't like how much time I spend with my brother but they also dislike that my brother buys stuff for me and doesn't ever get anything for the other kids here or even treats them like family. He has nothing to do with anyone else in the house.Things kind of bubbled over during Christmas when my stepsister was upset that I went to my brother's Christmas Eve and then her grandparents (stepmom's parents) came over and I wasn't there and missed out on \"family time\". I was kind of glad to miss it honestly. I'd rather be with my brother and my dad is always such a pain when his ILs are there because he wants me to call them grandma and grandpa.My dad and stepmom sat me down a couple of days after Christmas and told me I need to stop putting my brother before everyone else because it comes across as him being first in my life instead of everyone being equal. I told them he is first though and always was. I told them nothing has changed for me. They said he shouldn't be my priority when it comes to siblings at least because I have four siblings altogether and not just one. I didn't argue with them after that and they were pissed. I know my stepmom told dad afterward to let me live with him to spare the other kids but he said he couldn't do that or they'd never see me again. She asked if that would be such a bad thing because clearly I don't care about any of them.Their disagreement led to me being told again a few days later that I was behaving badly and shouldn't have said what I did.

	"body" : "My brother, older by 11 years, did a lot for me when I was younger and still living with our parents.  With him so much older than me, it often felt like he was a second dad to me.  Not only did he give advice and guidance, but he also paid for things out of his own pocket; took me on road trips, paid for movies/restaurants, let me borrow his car, etc.  Even when I was a young adult after high school, he let me stay in his apartment, rent free for a month, before I got my first job.  Not only that, he bought me a suit for my first job interview.  All this was really great and I'm very fortunate to have a brother that looked out for me.  He has been looking out for me for as long as I can remember.However, also for as long as I can remember, he has told me “You'll pay me back one day.\"  The first time I remember him saying this I was 5 years old and he was 16 years old.  Every time he would do something nice for me, he told me “You'll pay me back one day.\"  Being told this since a very young age, I automatically believed it was true and agreed that I would pay him back.  Even into my early 20's, I felt that I really owed him and that I needed to pay him back at some point.  I did do nice things for him when I had the opportunity, but not nearly to the scale that he did for me.  Being so much younger, I just couldn’t do as much for him as he did for me.Now I'm 32 years old and a dad.  When I do nice things for my kid, I can't imagine saying \"You'll pay me back one day.\"  In fact, I think that anyone that would try to instill a feeling of financial debt in a young child is a total AH.  A young child doesn't have the mental capacity to understand what this means or the ability to consent to debt.A few months ago, my brother, now 43 years old, said to me \"Remember all the things I did for you? You'll pay me back one day.\" I responded, \"Tell me how much and I'll pay you.\" He didn't respond to my comment, but a few minutes later said \"You know you'll pay me back one day.\" Again, I replied, \"Tell me how much and I'll pay you.\" He responded, \"Naw, I know you'll take care of me in the future.\"Last week, my brother told me that, because he helped me so much while I was growing up, he should be given 20% of the revenue, in perpetuity, from my small business.  I was shocked.  I refused to pay him he was extremely upset.I've sense decided that I don't owe him any money and that he may have been psychologically manipulating me since I was a young child.Am I the AH for refusing to give money to my brother?Is my brother the AH for expecting money from me?",

My wife is very kind to my daughter and they are quite close. My daughter has very little memory of her mom and has told me how nice it is to feel like she has a mom now. My wife is also happy to play that role in my daughter’s life. I’m not as close to Sophie, because she’s older and she spends  two weeks a month at her dad’s place. But she’s polite to me and I think she’s a wonderful girl.Sophie’s dad is pretty well off, my wife and I are less so. He was the main earner before my wife left him. My wife and I both work full time, but we have to be careful with our finances right now. We got my daughter a few books and Sophie a dress for Christmas. Both of them liked their presents. Sophie’s dad got Sophie a brand new car. We have only one car in the family right now, I drop my wife off on the way to work in the mornings, so it works out. But it does mean that I couldn’t take my daughter or Sophie anywhere during the holidays, as my wife still has to work. I have the week off because I’m a teacher. (She did have a few days off though.)Now that Sophie has the car, she is planning to go to her friends’ New Years party. My daughter asked if Sophie could drop her at her friends’ house too, and Sophie said it’s too far out of the way (extra half an hour approx) and it’s her car, so my daughter can wait until she’s old enough to drive. I thought this was uncalled for, so I said Sophie was being rude and she should drop my daughter. She said it’s not her fault I can’t afford another car for us.My wife said I should just let it go, because my daughter has a dad all the time and Sophie only has one half the time, and a car is fair compensation (not the right word, but I can’t think of a better one) for that. My daughter and Sophie are both upset now - AITA?Edit: I suppose you are right, it’s her car, she can do what she wants. I just thought it wouldn’t hurt her to think of others this time. My daughter asked very politely and Sophie often has much nicer things than my daughter and I’ve never asked her to share or anything. And I pay for all her gas while she lives with us.Edit again: 30 mins extra means 15 mins out of the way, 30 mins total. An hour is a lot of extra driving, I agree. I can’t reply to comments because of the poo mode, so editing here. To the person who said ask nicely - my daughter asked very nicely and Sophie literally said I don’t have to do anything for you. That’s why I said she was being rude. I’m not forcing her, I just said I think she should. To the person who asked if I broke up their family - Sophie’s dad cheated on my wife, twice.

Example, never leave any thing in his car.

My brother (18) lives with us. My husband and I both pay for everything equally. And my brother moved in due to unfortunate circumstances from not having reliable parents. He’s generally never home due to always being at work and when he is we usually don’t see him pass the catching up.My husband have asked my brother in the past to stop parking in his spot in the driveway and to park on the street 5 feet from our mailbox. And he will continually correct him if either of these rules are broken. Recently my husband and I got home from his sisters roller derby game, found my brother and his spot. My brother had stated that he was just pulling in real quick to drop us off some food on the counter and he was about to leave. But my husband wouldn’t have any of it. And stated that he (my brother) is to never park in his (my husband) spot no matter the circumstance. And what does he (husband) need to do to help him (brother) understand it.Of course in front of my brother I do not say anything and I stand by my husband. But behind closed doors I expressed how angry this had made me and how childish I thought he was being. I told him I understood if my brother was playing at the park there all night, but this is a situation where he was coming here to drop us off some food and was leaving and he didn’t need to be so rude. Let alone have such a ridiculous rule to never ever park in his spot even if it’s just for two minutes. My husband took this as mean not being on his side. And threw it in my face that he pays to live here and my brother lives here for free so he should be able to enforce this.So am I the asshole for not being able to understand where my husband is coming from.",

Also I have no idea how the system regarding preschool works in the US, so sorry if it is hard to understand.I gave birth to my son this August. In my country you get about 1,5 years worth of days you can take out to be on parental leave, most people save some of these days so they can stay home occasionally with their child as they get older. I am planning on taking all of these days and stay home until my son is at least 4. Of course a lot of planning has gone into this, I know we can’t eat the most extravagant food, buy the newest clothes or take expensive trips.

So every Saturday I take him to an open preschool, don’t know if it exists in the US but basically, everyone is welcome there with their child for a few hours, they play, we eat and do stuff together. There is a mother there who had her daughter last April. She expressed to me and some other parents how sad and upset she was about having to go back to work so soon and that she was stressed about leaving her daughter at preschool. She said that she wishes that she could be able to stay home as long as I planned, I said that it was possible. She told me that for them it wasn’t. I called bullshit on that, she obviously gets her hair colored, has makeup, trendy clothes and stuff like that. I told her that if she just budgeted and not spend that much on herself, of course she could stay home. She once again said that even if she did, they could not afford to stay home any longer. I know she has a husband, so it has nothing to do with that. I scoffed and said that “life is what you makes it out to be”. She seemed extremely upset over this.

We both decided to exchange lists and we each got a couple things from the list to keep up with the \"surprise\" of it all.My girlfriend's list was very descriptive.

I was happy to get her these things, but I didn't, and still don't, get the obsession with the brands.For Christmas, I did most of the shopping at Target for everyone, not just her. They didn't have a lot of the specific brands she wanted, but I got her what I found and what I thought she would like. I got her a bottle of foundation in her color, it was from the brand wet and wild. I got her a big bag of Dr. Teals bath bombs, which I know are a good brand since I use the salts often. I also got her a pair of running shoes. I can't remember the brand name, but they looked fine to me and we're in her size.

I picked up on her talking about the brands and I just told her I don't think we should buy brands just for the name, rather the quality and price of their products. Since these products are cheaper, and she got more bang for her buck, like with the bath bombs, I didn't see an issue. The price I paid for a whole bag would have only gotten me one from the company she wanted me to buy from. She got a bit cold after that and said next year we just shouldn't do lists since I don't want to gift her what she wanted.

They're pretty active kids who enjoy physical activities much more than anything else. Anne is more laid back, and we have a special bond.For example, my wife and I have a thing where we play chess or do crafts with our girls. Anne usually joins and asks us to sit with her. She also likes my profession (I'm an ENT doctor) and asks me all kinds of questions. (She loves the idea of being able to see inside one's nose and ear).For Christmas, we got all of Max's kids a special gift. They came over for dinner one day during the holidays. Now I'd already gotten Anne her very own chess set around a month ago, and hadn't been able to give it to her because I kept forgetting it and it was in my office for a good while.However, I thought I'd just give her the gift while she was with us. Amy also agreed and said it would be a good idea and she could play chess with her friends etc. Max seemed to hate the idea. When the kids were gone he told me I was being sexist for clearly favoring his daughter, and said I needed to treat his kids equally.I said I just wanted to give a special gift, Amy took my side and said Max was being very petty about something as innocent as this. He is still upset with me. I wanted to apologise but Amy said I don't need to because I didn't do anything wrong. Was it an AH move to give her the chess set then?Edit: I got Leo all kinds of baseball stuff like bat, jersey, ball, etc. I got Ryan a bike. I knew they specifically like those activities. The original gift for Anne was a barbie dollhouse since she loved the movie, and I gave her this chess set later as something I bought a month ago",

My entire life I dealt with; “this is your dads year for your birthday/Christmas/etc” to the point where HOURS were even divided up so I wasn’t with one parent longer than the other. I swore I would never put my son through the same thing. My parents still hate each other and I know if one parent is involved then the other won’t be but that ultimately is their choice to make.Ok, here we go. My son is turning two this year and I’m planning on a small party since I know he’s not gonna remember it and I don’t want to stress myself out over a party for two year olds. I told both my parents that they will both be invited and I will hold no I’ll will should they choose not to come. It is what it is. Well, one thing I forgot is that my MIL and her sister also have the same kind of relationship. My MIL and I have NO relationship. We can be civil towards each other when necessary but that’s about it. Her sister and I, however, have an AMAZING relationship. We talk almost everyday I’ve visited her a few times and she’s come to us. So I sent the same text to both of them. Spark noting the text: “no one will be excluding from being invited to my sons birthday and I hope that we can all be adults for a couple hours for my sons sake” MiL’s sister said she could just ignore her sister but now MIL has said they will not come if she is there; which circles back to the fact that I will not have “custody” birthdays so I just said while that is unfortunate, I understand and they can come visit another time. My husband (29m) thinks that I should tell aunt to come visit another time so his parents can attend but I think it was their choice to not be apart of this celebration and that they could have just been adults  for a max of 3 hours one day a year but are choosing to exclude themselves.

The unspoken agreement between the two of us was that I cover the bills whenever we go out together as I’m doing much better financially.For background information, Laura married right after college and became a SAHM. She only started working again last year after her divorce (no monthly alimony but ex husband takes care of all their children’s expenses; she has almost 6 figure USD from their joint bank account that is now hers) and now more or less has the salary of someone newly graduated from college.So we ordered five dishes to share at the restaurant. The dishes came one by one and Laura and I chatted as we ate. The last one was supposed to be a steak of a certain cut of beef and specific side dishes. What was served looked nothing like what was on the menu. I called for a server to take it back and get us the right order but my sister stopped me.Laura said the restaurant was super busy and we shouldn’t add burden to the already busy and hard working staff. She said we could just eat this dish we got by accident. She said some places the owners make the staff pay for this type of errors out of their own pocket and we should be kind.When the bill came, I told my sister she needed to pay for the dish we didn’t order. Laura threw a fit, telling me I knew she didn’t plan to spend this kind of money today as I have always paid. I said I told her to return the dish and she refused so paying for it was now her responsibility.Laura finally scraped together enough cash for the dish while I paid for the rest, my sister calling me AH for being so petty. Later my mom also called me and said I was being unkind because I could easily afford to pay while Laura would find it harder to make up the loss. AITA?",

	"body" : "Me (17m) am leaving for college in the summertime, I got into a huge private university in a big city due to scholarships for academics and tennis. Anyways my family doesn’t have much money my dad passed and my mom is single providing for me(kinda) and 14f sister. When I was 15 I got a high paying job and saved my money, which I used to buy myself everything I ever wanted. This included a gym membership, a 20k car I bought and is in MY NAME, a 2k dollar gaming computer, PS5, and some other things.Recently talks in my family arose about how nice life will be for my Mom 39f and sister when I leave for college since they will get a new car(my car) and the gaming devices my sister wants. I informed them that I will be taking all those things with me to college and they are not theirs to divide amongst themselves.My mom was furious because she was expecting a new car, for reference she drives a 2008 focus with 250k miles on it and I bought a 2019 jeep that has 45k miles on it. I informed my mom that if she stopped spending so much money on alcohol which she claims she needs from work stress and spoiling my sister with materialistic expensive crap, she could buy a new one and that it wasn’t my job to provide her with over 30k worth of things I bought.She responds if we are playing that game you need to give me back all the things I bought you, because besides basic necessities like housing, clothes, and food, she owes me nothing. I told her sure and gave her back my iPhone, then drove to Verizon and purchased a brand new one. When I came home with it she called me “unbearable” I told me once I leave for college, I’m not welcome back, to which my sister agreed. AITAEdit: for some questions being asked she believes she is entitled to those things because she is a single mother and worked hard to provide me with what I needed. I also received many phone calls from family trying to guilt me into giving her the car because she needs it more than I do. I offered her a discounted price of 15k when I bought it for 20 and pay for the insurance, if she gave me the money I would give her the title. She scowled and I said she owes me nothing and will not be speaking to me until I give her my keys and title. I told her that will not be happening and now have taken back my original discount and want full price.Another edit for some that have doubts: For context I was always the outcast of the family, my family believes in the church, and I was an accident(my mom doesn’t even know the father) the “dad” I referred to was my sisters dad. He adopted me when I was 3. He was great and kept my mom in check, then he passed. AND FOR CONTEXT ON THE JOB- My uncle kinda took me under his wing, he felt bad for the way my family treated me sometimes. He is the manager of a restaurant on the water that caters towards yacht owners, sports teams, business men ect. He gave me a job there and allowed me to work similar hours to him(a lot) in reference to my “high paying job” that means about 20-25k a year depending on business, which in my oppinion is high paying for a highschool studentUPDATE: So against the advice of some I sat my mom down this morning and told her I wanted to amend our relationship. I offered to finance her a new car as she can’t afford it and I would pay for the car payments but not insurance(I thought this was fair)She was estatic and I told her to send me a list of cars while I was running some errands. Well… she wanted Camaros, electric vehicles, mustangs ect. I told her I do not have that kinda of money. I have used car money NOT new/nice car money. She got upset and asked why I would promise her something I couldn’t no follow through on.This hurt me because I was offering her a car that was nicer than her current one and instead of being grateful she was upset I couldn’t provide her with a sports car with my HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL money. This finally opened my eyes to how truly bad she has become and I will be moving in with my uncle.",

Our parents got divorced and we used to live with our mom who was an addict. She was abusive and neglectful. Through all that, my sister was my biggest rock. She protected me, took care of me, cooked and basically raised me till I was 13. Afterwards we started living with dad and things got so better.She passed away 2 months ago, ovarian cancer. We were prepared for it but it was still obviously very hard. After her funeral, I told my girlfriend (she was staying w me for a week, her house had some work being done) that I'm gonna be spending time with my family (they lived close) that week. She was kinda salty about that but it was sorted soon.  I'm doing better now. Sis loved roses, her name was Rosie too so as a memory and to pay respect to her, I've decided to get a tatoo of rose. Nothing big, just about 2 inches on my upper arm. My dad decided the same.I was telling my gf about it and she got very angry and started screaming about how disrespectful it is to tattoo another girl on me. I told her it's my sister we're  talking about and my dad's getting one  too. She says that's different. She started screaming, so I walked away. She has now gotten her friend involved who says the only way I'm getting that tattoo is if I also tattoo my gf's name on me and she agrees.I think that's stupid af. We've been together for a year and she expects me to TATTOO her on me?? She then proceeds to say how I must love her sister more than her and I told her that's not a fair comparison and it's a different love. She ain't ready to listen. Idk why is she so bothered by her. When my sister was alive, she lived close by too and I used to visit her like twice a month. I understand some siblings might not be that close but we've always been. It's not like we were touchy around my gf because we were both not affectionate at all. My gf thinks it's incredibly selfish and disrespectful to her that her boyfriend has some other girl tattoed on him. I really don't see how? My sister and my gf used to get along. But now she says sis is dead so I need to let her go..!?!So AITA?",

	"body" : "my sister (26) is getting married to her high school sweetheart (also 26) in 2025. They are planning on a destination style wedding with around 50 guests to Florida. Sister is looking for a large beach house that can hold 14 of her closest family members for the week of their wedding. Among the houses she has found that are within walking distance to the beach and hold all of us will cost each person around $1,000. When going through the houses she was deciding on, she states that my boyfriend and I (both 25 years old) will have to share a room with either my grandmother or my two younger brothers (ages 16 and 6) because of the number of beds in the house. At first I was taken back by the price as both me and my boyfriend will have the pay the $1,000 plus sharing a room with someone else but after having a conversation with my sister and her fiancé, but I felt like I had no other choice but to suck it up having to pay the costs as she expressed she would only be getting married once and our mother had already expressed it was a little pricey which annoyed her. (background info my boyfriend and I just bought a house a few months back) Now after speaking about costs with my boyfriend (as he was not there during the initial conversation) | am starting to worry about the cost of staying at the beach house. As I am the sister of the bride and maid of honor I will have additional cost such as nails, dress, spray tan, flights to florida, food for the week, bachelorette party, etc. I texted my sister saying that after thinking about all of these cost I am worried about the beach house and gave a suggestion that my boyfriend and I could rent an airbnb that we found 8minutes away from where they would be staying which would cost us $1,300 for the week to split ($650 each). This upset her greatly with my mom telling me she was crying that I didn't want to stay with them and my sister telling me that shes upset we went ahead and decided we would rather stay in a separate house than be together. She says everyone is making sacrifices and sharing rooms and she's been trying her best to keep everyone's best interest in mind when it comes to cost and space. She says that they will not be asking for the payment right away with a 50% deposit at the time of booking and then the rest 2 months prior to the vacation which can help with upfront costs. In all, I don't think she's understanding that her want of having us all under the same roof is not possible without being too costly and I don't see the issue with us getting our own place 8min from them to help cut costs. I feel like I'm stuck in the middle of deciding to get a separate house with my boyfriend or \"sucking it up\" and spending the extra money for the beach house.

They met in the city I currently live in, and moved out of state 3 years ago. Her father lives in the same city as me so when they do visit time is usually split. When they first met she was over all the time, everyday in fact. She would spend holidays with us, spend the night all the time. My son lived with me until he was 23. The only negative experience that ever happened was between my youngest daughter (at the time 16) along with my son and his fiancée. There was a big fallout for over a year. They all reconciled, and they began coming around again. Once they decided to move out of state I never see them. They’re not even married yet and every holiday is spent with her family. When they come to town my son and her will visit, but she leaves to spend the night at her dads while my son spends the night at my house alone. I get them wanting to spend time with family separately, but in the last 3 years she hasn’t spent more than 2 hours visiting us, and she won’t spend the night even when I’ve insisted she’s welcome. This kinda leaves my son sad upon visiting, and then surely leaves my house to go to her dads.Both my adult children still live with me. My son (26) has severe ADHD, and my daughter (21) and grandson (2) also live with me. Yes, I have a full house, but they’ve always had their own bedroom upon visiting. It does cross my mind that maybe she judges how me and my family live, and how we do things, but she’s still with my son. Me or none of my kids are married, or have a college degree, but they’ll be the first married in our family, and she basically has the better career. I’m bringing up these things because they are the main differences I can deeply think of. Her and I don’t have much in common other than my son, they don’t have kids, but plan to. She’s polite and I don’t have an issue with her, but she is showing signs of wanting nothing to do with us. I have asked my son if she’s mad at us, or what’s going on, and it’s always an excuse. “She’s not feeling well” “she’s studying” “she’s busy” every time. I told him I sensed BS and how its a shame whatever she has against us, is affecting his relationship with everyone else. I told him to strongly consider if he wants to marry her and bring kids into this situation. He’s been upset with me since. AITA?**EDIT     I just wanted to put out that I completely understand when they visit they split up. It’s just very hard to see them as a couple for 7 years spend time together with all sides of her family along with seeing pictures online of them happy together, but not witness that bond in person like her family gets from them. Then there’s me who only sees her 2-4 hours out of the year, while my son visits alone and I can tell he wants her there. I would hate to see this situation if they had kids. Not that I don’t want them to get married. As far as my daughter- My son did show me some comments that were made online or through text at the time this happened. They were a couple years in dating (didn’t live with each other yet) and it was so early to know what to do. Had I known 7 years later they’d be engaged I would of probably handled it differently. I did punish my daughter, but didn’t go as far as having a conversation with everybody. 5 years has passed and I just don’t see bringing it up now? I just feel I had to summarize that better.",

	"body" : "I (29f) have been growing my hair out since before the pandemic  and managed to grow it out to halfway down my butt. I've never dyed my hair and I rarely style or blow-dry it so it's very healthy. My natural color is a very uncommon red, I've been told my whole life that it's almost impossible to recreate. It's not an uncommon thing for people to tell me they want my hair.2 weeks ago I finally decided I wanted to cut it short and donate it to Angel Hair For Kids, a company that makes wigs for children fighting cancer and other illnesses. I told my dad I was doing this and when I was doing it and he thought it was a great idea. I ended up cutting off 16 inches and have honestly never felt more like myself with my new haircut. I feel like I finally recognize myself again and for the first time in years feel good about myself.Cut to that same night. I had sent my dad a picture of my chopped off hair at the salon followed by the haircut pics. About an hour later I received a text from my stepmother (71f) who we'll call Jane. She asked if I would consider giving her the hair so she could have it sent out to make a wig for herself.Jane and I have had a very rocky relationship in the past. For 2 years in high school I didn't speak to her or my dad because of an issue that she had caused and never apologized for. We've since moved on and have a better relationship now. She has dealt with major health issues as long as I've known her and within the past 2 years has lost nearly all of her hair. She recently bought 2-3 wigs that look amazing on her. Every time we discussed the wigs she would joke that I should give her my hair since I had so much of it. Well it turns out that I misunderstood and she wasn't actually joking.When Jane asked me for my hair I had already sent it away for donation, which I told her. She didn't say anything about it after that, just asked me for more picture of my haircut which I sent. In all honesty the idea of giving her my hair feels quite weird to me. I imagine showing up to Christmas to see her wearing my hair and it brings up weird emotions about my previous relationship with her when I was younger and she was more controlling.When I saw my dad the following Monday he almost immediately brought up the fact that I had \"donated it elsewhere\" instead of giving it to Jane. I asked if she was upset about it and my dad told me that she was, and that he was also disappointed that I didn't think of her first. It's caused some tension between us and has made me uncomfortable, but it's also really put a damper on the whole experience of doing something good and finally feeling good about myself. I feel like I've done something wrong and selfish now.TLDR; I donated my hair to a children's cancer foundation instead of giving it to my stepmother who is dealing with hair loss and now she and my dad are disappointed in me.AITA here?",

Since she’s been staying here she’s been doing a lot of things me and my wife asked her not to do because we like things a certain way for example, don’t move anything in the house because me and my wife like everything the way it is or don’t eat leftovers in the fridge unless they’re yours (she did it anyway) and not to go into our bedroom.(she did it anyway) I am a 420 user and I like to smoke in the house because it’s my house and My wife has never had a problem with it, but I stopped smoking in the house because MIL is there now and I smoke in the garden, but whenever I come in my MIL ALWAYS complains and asks me why I have to smoke at all and complains that it stinks and I stink because of it and I never say anything back.The other day we were all in the living room and we heard a knock at the door, it was one of my MIL friends, my MIL then went to the door and invited her in, (she didn’t tell us she invited anyone to our house) we were all in the living room for about 5 minutes when she called me and my rude for not offering her uninvited guest a drink. She then goes to the kitchen and opens a bottle of £150 wine from Portugal (without asking) that me and my wife were saving for our anniversary and started drinking it with her friend.About half an hour later my MIL then asked me and my wife if we could go to our room so she can speak in private with her friend so my wife took me upstairs and apologised to me about her mum because she knows I hate unexpected guests. I then proceeded to smoke in the bedroom because I was stressed and annoyed, around 5 mins after she then starts shouting at me from the bottom of the stairs that I’m disrespectful for smoking in MY house and that I’m getting her and her friend “high”. I looked at my wife and she stood. There just looking at her feet So I went to the top of the stairs and told her she needs to be gone tomorrow when I get back from work because I refuse to be frustrated and uncomfortable in my own house.While I was at work I get a text from my wife saying I was disrespectful to her mum and that she and her mum will be at her aunts house until I’m ready to apologise to both of them, and when she comes back she will be bringing my MIL with her. I’ve told her I’m not apologising and when and if she wants to come back she will be alone or she can’t come back at allSo aitaUPDATE: FIL has texted telling me thank you for having my MIL for the past 2 weeks, I told him what happened and he said my wife should have been on my side because he knows how my MIL can be and told my wife to come home and apologise l, he said I was more than likely not going to get an apology from either of them but to change the locks and not to accept my wife back until she apologises and he won’t accept my MIL BACK until she apologised because it’s only a matter of time until aunt gets sick of em because she already has a house full of people  lol",

	"title" : "AITA For not wanting my fiancé’s mom to cut his hair before our wedding?",
	"body" : "My fiancés mother is a Jack of all trades; LPN, hairdresser, and dog groomer. Currently she is an LPN for work, and she’s in her mid 50s. She only cuts hair from her house now.I love her very much, but personally, I believe she has outdated hairstyling techniques. She seems to give very exact, bowl type cuts for men, and they tend to poof out on the sides as well. Whenever my fiancé gets a haircut from his mom, I don’t really like it, but he insists to “not hurt her feelings”. I have swallowed my words for 4 years every haircut he gets, but my wedding is where I want to draw the line.I have had her cut my hair a couple of times, and the last time she cut my hair, I had her take length off. I am biracial and have curly hair, so I advised her to kind of leave more than she normally would for straight hair. I woke up the next morning and my hair was poofy as a poodle. I looked like Dora pretty much. It was shorter than chin length, and I wanted it to touch my shoulders. That was the first time I have ever received an undesirable haircut (my mother is also a hairdresser, mid 40s, and it is her main source of income) so it was very devastating for me. Took me a year to grow out all of the issues with the length, and my bangs also were cut very short, way shorter than desired. Ever since then, I am honestly traumatized and I don’t let her cut my hair anymore. I never told her how I felt to spare her feelings, but I’m sure she knows I don’t want my hair cut by her anymore since it’s been over a year since she did it last.To add to this, his mother is very much a worry wart, and she seems very perfectionist, so often times she cuts more and more and more off your head because she wants it to look even. This type of thing worries me and is probably why I had such short hair after my last cut with her.Every woman dreams of this day, and I want our wedding photos to be beautiful. I just want to see his hair in a more up-to-date hairstyle than I believe his mom can give him, at least for our wedding photos. It matters very much to me.AITA for requesting that my fiancé goes to a younger, more up to date hairdresser before our wedding date? He claims that it will hurt her feelings, which may be true, but isn’t our wedding about us?EDIT/ UPDATE: Well, he says he is willing to give a new stylist a try for the wedding!By the way, by no means is his right to his body being taken away from him, and he wasn’t “forced”. My fiancé was just expressing being worried to upset his mom, and I wanted to know if that makes me an AH for asking him.Thanks for your input everyone!",

	"body" : "I (30f) am an aunt to 2 nieces (10) and 2 nephews (11 and 8) as well as one step niece (16f). Their parents are doing OK financially though not comfortable. I am much better off money wise.I’m one of those people who don’t know what to give people during Christmas and don’t have enough energy to figure out or guess. For years I gave friends and family gift cards to places I know they frequent like favorite coffee shops or bookstores. For nieces and nephews, I gave cash. I always thought their parents let them buy things they wanted but my bio nieces and nephews recently complained to me how their parents took my cash gifts and put the amount in each kid’s saving account. They said they wanted to be able to buy stuff like their oldest sister. My step niece also received cash gift from me but her mom let her spend the money.So for this year I gave each a box of chocolate at the Christmas gathering and told them I would also take them to the mall as part of my Christmas presents. I took all five out yesterday and gave them $50 each with the oldest getting $70 and told them to buy what they like. I asked the oldest to take the youngest to look around while I asked the middle three where in the mall they would like to go and took them. At the end of the day everyone got candies and toys and books and clothes. I fed everyone at the food court and dropped them off at my parents because their parents were meeting some friends.Later that night my sister called to yell at me. She said it was completely inappropriate of me to let her kids spend money freely like that. She said she put the money in the bank for them to teach them to be frugal while I just encouraged them to spend outside of their means. She said once her kids reach their teens like her stepdaughter she would allow them to use the money, too, but right now they’re too young and I am spoiling them.I think spending money on what you like is part of the Christmas experience. It’s just sad to have to be frugal even during the holidays. AITA?",

My FIL has recently been diagnosed with cancer, and my SIL drives him to all his appointments which are twice a week and I offered to babysit Ava during this time.At my house, I keep the heating on most of the time as it is very cold and my youngest refuses to wear anything with long sleeves or jumpers. When my SIL dropped Ava off for the first time, she wore like 4 layers and I told her to keep on as many as she wanted, but our house will get warmer when the heating comes on and she might not want to wear all those layers later.Yesterday my SIL texted me to stop putting the heating on when Ava comes over as Ava asks for the heating to be on at home now as it’s too cold and she won’t wear the layers. I flat out said no, as it’s my house and thought it was a weird thing for my SIL to ask. My husband thinks I’m being a bit too harsh and said we could compromise by the heating on a lower temperature and getting our youngest to wear a jumper. I told him to be my guest as our youngest refuses to wear a jumper and will not sit still at all if I try at put a jumper on him. My husband then told me my SIL is struggling with bills at the minute and that Ava asking for the heating to be put on was probably embarassing for her and that me saying no was a bit harsh.",

	"body" : "So I (24f) have an older brother (40m) Mick. Mick has been married twice. His first wife, Katie, is the mom to my nephew Conor (20m) and my niece Aoife (18f). She sadly died 12 years ago. I was actually really close to Katie. She treated me like her little sister and used to take me places with Con and Aoife. So my niblings and I have always been close.Mick really didn't want the kids to grow up in a one parent household so he remarried within the year to Jennifer. They met 4ish months after Katie died at my parents house (Jennifer was our neighbor) and were married 9 months after Katie died.Mick focused a lot back then on the kids needing two parents. He told my niblings that Jennifer could save them from falling into a pit and that she was lovely, worked with kids, so they should do their best to open up their hearts to her and let her in. I'd say after six months of marriage Mick realized the kids were not as okay with that as he wanted them to be and he told them Jennifer was now their mom and they should show more love to her, because she was their future. When Conor exploded and told him Jennifer was not going to be his future, Mick decided the only way forward was to enforce family day once a week (Sunday).Mick and Jennifer had three kids together over the next five years. Con and Aoife never bonded with them which drove Mick crazy so he would push more for the forced bonding. He would also get very angry when Con and Aoife told him they didn't care about Jennifer and when they said he betrayed their mom and them by moving so fast.Last year Con stayed with them over Christmas when he was home from college. Mick figured this was the sign that Con and Aoife had adjusted now that they were \"basically adults\". But this year when Aoife was also at college they chose not to visit Mick, Jennifer and the kids at all. And both told him they had no plans for a visit and no time for him to visit. When he said they would still go and try to see them for a bit both told him they didn't want to see him.Mick decided to vent this all to me the day after Christmas when we were at our parents house. Every time I tried to talk about something else he would dump way more on me. This was a big surprise to me because he always dismisses me as a kid and has told me before I'm not adult enough to talk to about \"grownup stuff\". I outright asked him to stop and he told me this was all my fault so I should shut up and let him talk. I asked what the hell he meant and our mom asked the same. He said I should have encouraged my niblings to give Jennifer a chance and to stop seeing his remarriage as a betrayal. He said I had way more power and then he called me a stupid little child. I asked him why he insisted on dumping on me and expected so much from me when I'm just a child. I told him none of this was on me and it was entirely on him. He yelled at me which mom and dad kicked him out for. But he's saying I was a brat to him.AITA?",

I thought that was the end of it, but every single time I have been out with Laura  she has brought up my allergy. Telling me if I am sure I can eat that. Vetoing places to eat since they serve peanuts. I have talked to her before, it has caused tension in the group and me explaining over and over again that my reaction is very mild and I can eat places just fine.Ever single time she acts like she knows my allergy better and that if I keep eating it on accident it will get worse. I’ve explained a million times that isn’t always the case and I literally did the opposite in peanut exposures. Nothing has gotten through to her. Everyone’s allergies are different.I was hanging out with the group and we wanted burgers and suggested 5 guys. The store has peanuts in it. Laura blew up telling my other firmed they are horrible for trying to get me to have an allergic reaction.I had enough and told her to stop micromanaging my allergy, that she needs to stop pushing her trauma on me.

	"title" : "AITA for asking my sister to leave over Christmas because her kids were really loud?",
	"body" : "I (34m) have an older sister \"Kate\" (36f) who has 3 kids \"Ella\" (11f), \"Mike\" (7m) and \"Dylan\" (18 month). Me and my wife \"Lina\" (35f) live in the house she has inherited. The house is rather large and has a lot of space but due to its age is not very soundproof. To give an example Lina can hear me in the downstairs kitchen while working in the office on the second floor in a different part of the house.Before I get to the issue it is important to note that Lina is also suffering from very bad migraines usually triggered by loud sounds that affect her vision and make it blurry so she has to lie down in peace and quiet for an hour or so to let it pass before she carries on working. Unfortunately she also pulled a short straw this year and had to work through Christmas (usually it means be on call due to specific line of her job). As she deals with high profile clients she can't be disturbed when on call and prefers the house being quiet (noise cancelling headphones don't help). Lina is also working from home and the closest office is 6 hours away.To the issue: at the start of last week my sister's house had a malfunction, making it temporarily inhabitable. Due to Christmas and all the holidays it is not going to be fixed until the start of the new year so she and her partner asked if it will be okay to live with us as we have more space compared to our parents. I have consulted Lina and told Kate they can stay provided she keeps the kids quiet and explained the nature of Lina's migraines and her line of work. The rules were simple such as kids either wearing headphones when watching TV or have it on lower volumes and Kate making sure Dylan is not upset and crying all the time. Kate and her partner thanked us and promised to keep the kids in check.2 days go by, I'm out and about to help my parents until I get a distressed call from Lina saying the kids are very loud, she spoke to Kate but she can't bring them under control. I can hear the kids clearly on the background, so I call Kate and remind her of our agreement and she promises to fix it. However the next day the kids are even worse then before, shouting while playing fortnight and Dylan is constantly upset and crying, which is affecting my wife and her work. She even got a few complaints in as her clients couldn't hear her (we do plan renovating the house and making her office soundproof, just saving money for it).Due to this I have asked Kate and her partner to leave and probably move in with my parents as they were unable to follow simple rules. My tried to argue and beg for me to change my decision, but ultimately the house is Lina's and these were her rules to follow. As it happened the day before Christmas my sister called me an asshole and said I have ruined Christmas for my niece and nephews before packing and moving to our parents. My parents also called me earlier and said I was unreasonable and they are kids so me and Lina should be more understanding.",

	"body" : "My (M23) girlfriend (F23) and I have been dating for two years now. I was a swimmer in college, but since graduating, I've gained a little bit of weight. Nothing crazy, but I'm 5'11, and 170 lbs, up from ~145 in college. I used to have abs, but I haven't really cared as much about working out anymore, since I just feel comfortable in our relationship, and I know she doesn't care what my body looks like.We recently went out on a double date with some friends that I haven't seen in a while, Jack and Erica (fake names). We're all having a good time at dinner, joking around. Jack and I have known each other for a long time, and always tease each other, so he makes fun of me and says that it looks like I've gotten a bit chubby since we last saw each other. I laugh it off since that's how we've always been, and since it's not really true, I just have a slight gut now. His girlfriend Erica joins in and says that Jack has been working on his beer belly too, which Jack definitely has put on a few pounds recently like me. Jack says that we've both put on some happy relationship weight gain and grown guts. I say that I got the Boyfriend 20, joking that I've gained 20 pounds while dating my girlfriend. The conversation changed from there, but we were all laughing about it.Once we get home, my girlfriend says that I embarrassed her in front of my friends by saying that I said she made me fat. I get upset because she just inadvertently called me fat when I never said that at all, just that I had gained weight. I told her that I was just joking and that she shouldn't have taken it so seriously, especially because Erica was making the same type of jokes about Jack. I was also frustrated because she was making me feel bad about my weight gain, which I had never really cared about before. I told her that I know I'm responsible for myself getting a little chubby, but I didn't really care because I felt less pressure to look perfect while dating her. I guess this was the wrong thing to say because she got more upset.Am I the asshole?Edit: I weighed myself after making this post, and I'm actually 178 lbs right now, so a little heavier than I originally thought. I also have made jokes in the past about getting chunkier, but I've never used the word \"fat\" to describe myself, since I don't think it's true.A few of you were asking in the comments about my girlfriend's weight, and she's very healthy and has always been. Her weight has never seemed to be a concern to her, nor has it been something we've discussed.",

I’m not very experienced when it comes to dating.So we have 3 kids, 10, 4, and 2. Our oldest is not my biological daughter, she is actually biologically my husbands cousin.  Long story short we adopted her and raised her as her mother and father.Husband and I procrastinated on this but we never gave her the talk. So we decided to just rip the band aid off. She was asking about why people get amicably divorced (not in those words) and I just said “well to be honest with you, I don’t know. I’ve only ever been with your dad, and obviously we never broke up.”And then kids got in the conversation and she asked the “why are you guys so much younger than all the other moms and dads?”And I just said “we’ll talk about that later” and we did. Husband and I talked to her in her room and just explained to her why the other parents are older and where she came from. She had an idea, but never got the full story. She didn’t cry at first. She just had questions, and then said “wait, Mommy, so that means we aren’t related at all?” And I didn’t know what to say and she broke down.Hardest moment of my life.And I just told her the truth. I said just because she came from somewhere different it doesn’t mean we love her any less than her siblings, and she’ll always be my first born.She was still very upset to find we aren’t related by blood. She said at least Dad and her are related somehow. She said she feels like she doesn’t belong here and she doesn’t fit in with her siblings.So today I told her there was something I’d like to give her. I showed her my grandmothers necklace. My grandmother gave it to her first born daughter (my mom) and I was going to wait until she was 13, but I think it’s time I give it to my first born daughter.My mother wasn’t upset I gave it to her, she was upset I gave it to her early. Her mother gave it to her when she was 13 and she gave it to me when I was 13. I guess I broke tradition.Only thing is, she never told me to wait, and I feel like it was my necklace once she gave it to me so I can pass it down when I feel the time is right.",

	"body" : "I (30M) have been teaching at a school for 2 years now. I am in my 7th year of teaching. I’m  good at it, students like me and do well in my class.The other teacher of my subject, Mr D (53M), has been at the school for  20 years. He is very particular about how he wants things done. Majority of students hate him because he is extremely rude and has anger issues. Many students have told me they think he is bi-polar because he goes from being overly friendly to aggressive at the drop of a hat. I always shut down these conversations. A student was talking about him and said “he has a specific expectation of what he wants you to do, but doesn’t tell you how to do it, and then gets angry when you haven’t done it the way he wants.” This sums him up perfectly and is relevant to what’s next.Ever since I met him, Mr D has been extremely rude to me – ranging from  passive aggressive comments to outright rudeness, to saying negative things about me to students. I have always brushed this off. My Head of Dept has even told him TWICE that this is unacceptable (I did not ask them to do this, they only told me about it after).Several months ago Mr D flipped out over something  minor, and came to my class while I was teaching and demanded I talk outside. He attacked how I teach, how he thinks I’m not teaching the students properly (by his standards), and how “this isn’t good enough”. This is incorrect, and I tried to get a word in but he wouldn’t let me.This went on for a couple minutes as I stood there stunned. I turned around and looked in the room, and about half the class was listening to our conversation. I told him the conversation was over and went back inside. I literally could not speak I was so angry. I had to leave and go to the bathroom to collect myself. About 10 minutes later he sent me an email apologising. I emailed him back the next day  and he apologised several more times.Since then, I have ignored him beyond the only most essential communication, which I try to keep to email. He has noticed this, as he keeps coming up to me and trying to be nice and speak to me. I don’t give him anything beyond a one-word response and walking away.The other day we had an assembly, and some students sang infront of the whole school. After he came up to me and said how nice it was, and I said “uh huh” and turned and walked away. Next period, he came to my class to speak to me again, and I said “it’s pretty obvious I’m busy right now, send me an email and if I have time I’ll reply”, turned my back on him and continued speaking to a student. One of my students saw this and said that they saw me walk away from him during the assembly (I have no idea how they saw this lol). They were laughing as they said it but said that I was being rude to him, which they found very funny because they don’t like him. I spoke to another teacher and they said that I was being rude and should be nicer to him.So, AITA?",

	"body" : "AITA for leaving family Christmas vacation early?My (29) sister (33) lives in a foreign undeveloped country that is a 12 hour flight away. She invited my mom to come stay with her over Christmas, and suggested 6 weeks from early December to mid January when flights were cheapest (before and after Christmas rush).She also invited me to come and stay, however I work full time and was unsure when exactly I could come, but I knew had to leave the first week of January. Before booking flights, she said she wanted to organise some new years plans with her friends and asked if I would be happy to entertain our mom whilst she did that (because she did not want us at her new years plans). I agreed and to not get bored, I booked a 3 night guided trip from the 30th to 2nd Jan for me and my mom (the 30th is day after my sister told me she would be leaving with her friends).I ended up booking my flights very late (well after my mom had arrived and after I booked our guided trip) due to work and booked to come for 13 days. I asked my sister when she would be returning from her plans as I would fly home that day so my mom would not be alone. She told me her trip was 6-7 nights, which I found strange as I thought ‘new years plans’ would be 2-3 days max.Fast forward to me arriving, I ask my sister if she has confirmed her return flight from her new years plans, and she tells me it’s now a 7-8 night trip. After 3 days of being here, I decide to bring my return flight forward to the day after the guided trip finishes because the city is not very pleasant and there is not much to do (we did all tourist sights in 3 days), my sisters house and the bedroom I’m sleeping in is not very pleasant, and if I am going to sit around not doing anything, I would rather be at home.I told my mom my decision and tried to convince her to do the same, however she does not want to so said she will stay alone until my sister gets back from her trip (3 days alone here).My sister has been telling me how I am selfish for leaving my mom alone to go home early, which is true, but I feel like my sister shouldn’t have even gone on a 7/8 night trip whilst she had visitors that she invited here in the first place.So AITA?",

She started teaching me how to cook whenever I would go to my grandparents to visit. Grandma always believed it was important for kids to start learning pretty young and to know the basics early. But she also told me it was important for boys to learn because so many people think it's a woman's thing and then you have grown men who can't make a singe thing for themselves. Grandma has this cookbook that her grandma started. Her grandma thought all her kids from it and then her mom did the same for her and her siblings until grandma got it and did the same with my dad and his siblings. She has taught some of her grandkids pieces from it but she and I have cooked through the whole book in the last decade and it's been great.After my dad died mom got married to her boyfriend, and my parents were separated before he died, and they have two daughter's together aka my half sisters. My half sisters are 9 and 8 years old and my mom has shown them Facebook posts my grandma made about the two of us cooking from her cookbook. She doesn't post often and she and my mom aren't friends so I'm not sure why mom even saw. But she was showing the girls for a while and they got jealous and wanted to take part but they don't know my grandma and aren't included in my time there, thankfully.

My mom and Dad split up during the pandemic which took a hard hit on me as I was close to my dad.Three months later she started dating my step-dad who we'll call Steve, I liked Steve at first as we had a lot in common and he has done a lot for me but over the past few months I've started to dislike him. He talks about respect a lot and he expects me and my brother to respect him because of what he does.We had moved house recently and I was excited as it was the first time I had my own room as I had always shared with my brother, I had asked both my mom and Steve to knock on my door if they were coming into my room which I don't believe is a hard ask. My mom has always done this but Steve never does, he always swings my door open and I always ask him to knock, a few days ago I asked again to which he replied \"when you get your own house you can have privacy\", this bugged so I responded with \"you're a grown man, knocking a door shouldn't be hard for you\" this set him off and he started raising his voice saying \"I'm the reason you have a house over you head, I don't see your dad paying any bills\", I then told him to not speak about my dad like that as he had nothing to do with this, I told him that for a guy who expects respect off everyone he's the most disrespectful person I've ever known and that he should earn my respect, too which I replied he hasn't earned yet and he never will. He told me to leave which I did.I'm currently staying with my dad and have gotten phone calls and messages from the other side of my family telling me to go back to their house and apologise to Steve, but i don't feel like I have to. AITA?Edit: Just to clear up some things as I believe it may be causing some confusion. 1, I didn't take an aggressive tone nor did i raise my voice at my step-dad during our altercation, he did raise his voice but not to the point of full on shouting. 2, Both my step dad and Mom work so they split the bills, I pay £100 a month for rent as this was the amount the three of us (mom step dad and me) agreed upon when I started working part time.",

	"body" : "In September my ex-wife Regina started a new job that prevents her from dropping off our nine year old daughter Cassie at school in the morning during her parenting weeks. I agreed to allow Cassie to be dropped off at my house on her way to work. I also get her on the bus when it comes by at 8:30am.The problem is that Regina has been dropping her off at 6am in the mornings which interrupts my sleep. They knock on the front door upon arrival and I come to open it. I then go back to sleep on the couch in the living room while Cassie also sleeps on the other couch. We both sleep until my usual wake up time at 8am. However, the sleep disruption is enough to make me tired during my workday.I've requested that Cassie come in using the key that I gave her. That would at the very least not force me to get out of bed and walk to unlock the door, which fully wakes me up and makes it difficult to fall back asleep. I will still know when Cassie comes in the door because I sleep right next to it and can hear her enter. My ex-wife refuses to make that concession and insists that they knock on the door, waking me up, and expect me to open the front door to let her in.Regina says that it takes Cassie too long to use the key and it's so cold outside. She also complained that I take too long to get to the door, leaving them out in the cold for longer than they want to be. She said that I should be \"watching her\" anyway (meaning she expects me to stay fully awake after 6am) and that this is easier on me than going to Regina's apartment to pick up Cassie and go back to my house.I think Regina's viewpoint is ridiculous. I am providing free child care during her parenting weeks. If I didn't open my home for Cassie to stay in the morning, she would have to go to a paid day care center. I think Cassie is old enough that she should know how to use a key and regulate herself enough to be independent while I'm asleep. With the both of us sleeping in the living room, it's really no different from any night time during my parenting weeks so I don't think it's necessary that I be fully awake at 6am.AITA?[Edited to fix paragraph spacing]",

	"body" : "okay for context i’m (20F), I was named after my great grandmother on my moms side who passed when my mom was young. I’m the youngest of my siblings, i was close to my step siblings growing up but after realizing how my step mom and two out of three step siblings use my father and literally LEECH off of him. My oldest step sister(25F) has two kids, her oldest(4M) was named after my brother(23M) and her youngest(7 months F) with my name as her middle name. She didn’t speak to me or my brother about naming her kids after us/including our names in their names and i just think it’s so weird because 1. both of our names are not common AT ALL   2. I haven’t spoken to that side of the family in almost a year    3. my brother and I were always left out of sibling days by our step sisters. the only way i found out about the baby having my name as her middle name was when my dad sent me a picture of the baby with her name at the bottom, i did block my dads number after he sent that as that was the first text i’ve received from him in over 6 months(and i was very upset). I have given them all the silent treatment since then as i want no part of that weird family and i just feel like it’s a way of replacing me and my brother as we’ve grown detached from that side of the family since my dad pretty much prioritized them rather than my brother and I when we were minors. Part of me feels like i might be overreacting but i just think it’s weird that my name was taken without a discussion. So… AITA for giving them all the silent treatment after that?EDIT: I do want to give a little more info, so we grew apart after i had tried to be involved with them and they made no effort to be involved with me, I was taking the bus from my community college in the suburbs to the city to go see them, I would try to organize family days on top of my studies, yet when i asked why my dad didn’t bother to call me first he would say “the phone works both ways”, none of them would reach out to me and that’s when I had sort of detached myself. it wasn’t until after this that I realized how they were to me and my brother growing up, and how they treat my dad. My dad is pretty much the sole provider in their household, which my step sisters and my dads wife live, even though he doesn’t make that much. my step sister leaves her oldest to my dads wife and my dad to take care of and the dynamic is weird, when my dad lost his job his wife didn’t step up or anything to contribute so my dad had to keep taking out loans to support everyone. the announcement of her name was shortly after i had made it into university after being a high school drop out so it was a big thing for me (which none of them congratulated me or even acknowledged me on after my brother told everyone in their household about it), i feel like it was weird asf considering i had accomplished something really big for myself. ALSOOOOO i never said i owned the name, it’s just odd that she happened to name both of her kids after my dad’s only biological children.EDIT 2: again… i never said i owned the names.",

She reached out and asked if I'd care about her being pregnant at my wedding, to which I was hesitant to respond. It caught me completely off guard as she isn't married and had barely been with her boyfriend for 6 months at this time. She then goes on to explain to me that her boyfriend is planning to get her pregnant and starts to describe this grand scheme where they'll fall pregnant, get engaged, marry, and then have a baby all in under a year. My initial concern was the timelines and rush on it all as we've spoken several times about her plans and this completely contradicts all of them.Beyond that, we started to discuss the actual timeline of the pregnancy, which if it goes to plan would have her well into her 3rd trimester during my wedding. So close that I don't think she may even be able to attend the wedding at that time (between 38-40 weeks). The initial shock of the conversation lead me to ultimately answer \"Let's just see what happens,\" because I would hate to damage our friendship over things that haven't happened yet. It's now been a few weeks and she's brought it up again mentioning how her future pregnancy will change some things with my bridal activities and how she’s planning to have her own wedding 4 months after mine.I love my friend dearly and I truly would never ask anyone to put a pause on their life for the sake of my wedding, but I'm starting to feel like I should ask her to step down.

	"body" : "Been with my BF for 3 years. Was introduced to his 3 children 6 months or so ago. Great kids but all of them lack boundaries and it's obviously a parental issue more so than their issue. They are 13(male), 12(female) and 8(male). The 2 younger ones have ADHD as well and are off the walls 24/7.We started doing weekend sleepovers 2 months ago and it's honestly been hell. For no other reason outside of the fact that I literally have zero space to decompress because the kids follow you everywhere you go. They have no clue how to entertain themselves. Given that they are literal children, I don't blame them. But my one hard limit is the kids being in my room. I don't like anyone in my bedroom. That's my private space. But there have been multiple times when I have been in the bedroom and one or all of the kids will come in and just take over my bed completely. Laying down with their tablets. Or if I'm watching TV in there, more often than not they will come in and take over my TV or just talk 24/7 so I can't focus on anything other than them and their questions. Despite the fact that usually when I do watch TV in my room, it's because they have taken over the TV in the living room and there's no place to sit. I've told my BF I don't want anyone in my room and that it makes me uncomfortable but it's almost as if he thinks it doesn't apply to his children because just days after telling him this, him and I were watching a movie around 7pm (when the kids have their downtime and had a movie on for themselves in the living room) and all of his kids came in to my room and immediately climbed in to my bed so I was stuck in a 2ft square in my own space because I couldn't move otherwise. That and they bring their tablets with them. So I'm trying to watch a movie and all 3 of them have their tablets on my bed with the volume up and I have never been so overstimulated in my life. And it happens all the time. If we are in my room, they are too. If we are in the kitchen, they follow us. If we go outside, they are right behind us (but we can't get them to go outdoors by themselves).Yesterday I had a terrible day (family stuff). My BF had his kids over and I was just needing space away from their chaos. I said I was going to my bedroom to get time alone. BF comes in maybe 20 minutes later to check on me and not even 2 minutes following that, his kids are in my room and on my bed. The youngest doing flips and moving the bed from the wall. I told them to get out 6 times before they actually listened. My BF said they just want to be around us and I said I don't care. My bedroom is off limits from this point forward. He said he doesn't think he can do that because he enjoys having his kids near him and doesn't want to shut them out and asked me to reconsider or \"make a schedule\" of when they could be in my room with us. I refuse. He says I'm being unreasonable and that by being with a single parent, I need to learn compromise.ETA: I'm 30. He's 32. The only issue I have is with the kids being in my bedroom. I don't hide away in there or anything like that (kinda sounded like that in the post due to poor wording). I usually only slip away to my bedroom between 6-7pm but they almost immediately follow me because their dad does. Admittedly, if they would just sit down and not do flips or jump on my bed or shift the bed away from the wall or even wipe their feet before getting in to my bed, I would probably be willing to compromise. However, they've been told several times that my bed is not a jungle gym and to stop jumping/doing front flips. The youngest does not listen at all because of the overwhelming amount of energy he has. He is constantly doing flips over everything- not just my bed. Not a single one of them wipe their feet so there's constantly dirt and when I remind them, it's met with a \"sorry, I forgot\" and then still don't wipe their feet. They're great kids. I get along with them really well. But it doesn't change the fact that my space is disrespected and they have no business being in my bedroom. We do not live together. This is happening at my home. He has been bringing the kids to my house every other weekend because we have been tiptoeing around the idea of moving in together.",

He's not being an ass about it but this definitely didn't start happening until after I found out about the pregnancy. But what pisses me off is that this isn't a matter of him trying to get everyone to share. It's just my oldest. His reasoning is that my 13yo has much nicer stuff than the younger two. My two younger children have a habit of breaking everything, whereas my oldest doesn't. So my 13yo got a $350 gaming headset and a gaming PC for Christmas. But the other two kids got a pair of ear buds ($15) and an Xbox. All other gifts were of equal value.Anyways, my son wanted to stay at his dad's house after Christmas but my two youngest wanted to come home. I work nights. My husband works from home. I came home at 8am the next morning and found my daughter on my son's brand new gaming PC that he hadn't even used yet. I immediately told her to get off of it.

Problem is that he wears pullups to bed (ADHD) and left my oldest son's bed smelling like urine and I had no idea until my oldest came home 2 days later. My husband said it wasn't a big deal and that he was just cold and wanted to be more comfortable. \"The bedding can be washed. It's fine.\"The tip of the iceberg for me was definitely today. My daughter has already lost her headphones and wanted to use my son's brand new gaming headset. My husband immediately said \"yeah that should be fine.\"  So I stepped in and said \"no\". My husband said, again, \"it's not even a big deal\" when it absolutely is a big deal. And then 2 hours later he told the kids to go outside and told my daughter she could wear my son's snow pants because hers were too small. My daughter is like 4in taller than my son. She can't find her new snow pants that actually fit her. So he wanted my son to wear his sisters snow pants, that are about 2inches too small for even him, so that his sister could wear his and be more comfortable. I snapped. I told him that he only tries getting my son to give up his stuff and doesn't push the same narrative with the other kids and either he stops or he needs to leave. I told him my son will not be forced to share ANYTHING with his siblings and that if the other two would stop losing and breaking their own shit that they wouldn't need to use his. He says I'm being overdramatic and blowing this out of proportion.edit: formattingETA: my husband was the baby in the family (out of his 4 siblings) and was spoiled himself so this is a learned behavior I think. I've tried talking to him about it and he admits to wanting my son to share everything because his stuff is nicer and it's not fair to the younger 2. He said I'm spoiling my son and not teaching him the benefit of sharing. He is much closer to my younger kids because they were younger when he came in to the picture. My son is a daddies boy and while he does like his step dad, he made it clear he wasn't interested in a father/son bond because he was already so close to his dad. This topic was only brought up after my husband made a comment that he wanted to be an equal next to my ex and my son was not okay with it. I have spoke to my son about it and he said what irritates him the most is that it's my husband making decisions, not me. In his words, he would be more receptive to me making decisions like that over my husband because my husband is overstepping and needs to take a backseat.",

	"body" : "I mean, it's a pretty cut and dry situation in my opinion but due to some reactions I've gotten I guess I'm looking to see if I might have overreacted. Throwaway account of course.So I was raised very religious in the South of the United States. One of the big parts of my upbringing was an emphasis on hell and how I would burn there for all eternity unless I had \"accepted Jesus into my heart\". My parents and other adults at the church would go on and on about hellfire and torture for as long as you'd listen and as a result I grew up terrified of dying without being fully confirmed in my faith.I would literally ask god to save me and try to confirm my beliefs in Jesus multiple times a day to stave off the damnation I thought was potentially coming my way. I would have nightmares where I died and went to hell forever. It was always on my mind and it messed me up from around 4 years old and onward.Finally I went to college, found other views and opinions and left the religion.Cut to today, I (37m) and my wife (35f) are both atheists. Our daughter is now 4 and my parents came over to visit us. I was in the kitchen with my wife when I hear my daughter burst into tears in the other room. My wife and I rush in to find my mother talking with her and basically telling her all about \"how to avoid hell\".I was incredibly angry and kicked my parents out. My daughter is still having nightmares just like I did. My parents say I'm being unfair and that they are trying to save her soul from their made up torture prison and that 'their granddaughter's soul is more important than my objections' I'm not having it. I've cut off all contact with them and my wife is in agreement.Some friends when told the story, say I'm being too harsh on my parents as they are only trying to help, I say I specifically told them to not do things like this and the consequences are natural.

I didn't cared about it at first, I was more intrigued than annoyed because this is the same G that is pretty close with other two queer work mates, H and J (at least from what I see in the office).I read the comments, and there were a bunch more peopl agreeing, disagreeing, etc.. and G was leaving comments(word for word), \"Cope. F@gs are not special\", \"Stop forcing it down everybodys throat\", \"Mental illness like this shouldn't be supported or normalised\", \"They're not going to heaven lol\", and more.I took screenshots and sent it to our two queer work mates and asked their thoughts about it. \"J\" replied saying he was disappointed because \"G\" seemed like a cool guy. And \"H\" didn't reply to me but reacted a thumbs up to my chat. Both unfollowed \"G\".I went to work the next morning and G was basically giving me the death stare. I didn't really notice him at first cuz Im just there to do my job and leave. But I noticed no one seemed to be talking to him like the usual.During break, I learned H and J told everyone else about his comment and how he made them feel unsafe. My name was also mentioned; they thanked me for the heads up about G.G didn't talk much and seemed grumpy throughout the whole day. He was the first one to leave as soon as our shift was over.I recieved a message from him how I was an asshole for sharing his comments with others. (His comments were buried deep in the post's comment section and a casual glance won't find it.). A few other guys told me what I did wasn't cool and he's free to share his opinion and that I didn't have to be obsessed with his comments and share them with H and J.I heard HR is currently dealing with it but I dont know what theyre exactly doing.",

This summer he was starting to go blind from diabetes so I drove out and spent a few months rounding up his cattle and cutting his hay to get sold. When the work was done he said he wanted to sell my wife and I the ranch. He named his price, which was certainly under market, but would provide well for him and his wife until they passed. We agreed and had attorneys draw up the purchase agreement, had land surveys done, legal, etc. Everything was signed and set to close. The day prior to closing FIL was served with divorce papers, halting the sale. MIL stated that she wanted to make sure she got her fair share out of the deal and getting a divorce was the only way she would be legally entitled to half.A few days after getting served FIL has a heart attack, and died in the ICU about a month after.   My wife and I dug the hole with a backhoe , bought him a casket, and put him to rest yesterday. Mother in law didn’t even bother to show up for the burial, neither did his other daughter.Today, I stopped in to say goodbye to MIL before my wife and I started the two day drive home. She asked what needed to be done to cancel the land purchase agreement, to which I told her that we still intend to proceed, that all of the money would now go to her alone. She said that we weren’t paying enough for the land and she wanted us to cancel the agreement.We said no, we had a deal with FIL that we would buy the land, and provide for them, and also promised to keep the ranch whole as long as we could. This didn’t end well; she accused us of stealing her inheritance, going behind her back, screwing her over, etc. It got to the point where I just had to say I’m sorry, I love you, but I have to get back home.So, I plan on enforcing the purchase as agreed with my father in law, despite my mother in laws wishes. I feel guilty as fuck.  AITA?Edit:  We are not concerned about the legal side of things; we had 3 lawyers work on the PA to make sure it was legit (ours, his, and a neutral 3rd party draftsmen).

She used to live in another state with her grandparents because of her college so we didn’t spend so much time together other than so eventual family gatherings and the times she came to sleepover.Now she always had dream of running cosmetics company/brand type of thing and she wanted to start her line of makeup stuff like lip glosses , lip scrubs and all of that now through social media. When my husband told me this I was like great she should go for it. The problem is she has absolutely no resources to start this and I mean money. She never had a proper job so she doesn’t have her own income.I make more money than her father okay and he can’t give her the proper fundings since she needs alot and at the same time it will be a financial toll on him so he asked me to fund her. I did my research on what she might need like the material she would need and shipping company payment and discovered she might need at least need 10K pounds (2K in us dollars and I prefer not to disclose my country). She even contacted me for help and I told them I can pay this amount if I either get right to a percentage of her brand  if I become long term investor to her brand. Or if she just wants my help for short term she can sign a contract that states she’ll have to pay me back one my short term help is not needed.They both disagreed and my husband started attacking me for treating carla (step daughter) like a business partner I told him that’s literally business we are getting to and told him that later suggestion is actually generous of me I’ll let her have all the rights to her brand just pay me back. Carla told me she will pay me back but doesn’t want to sign any contract and I told her that her tantrum when she discovered she is not getting free fundings is the reason I’d need to have a contract. We had this lengthy conversation and they ended up not agreeing on my terms so she didn’t go further with her brand.My husband is still mad at me then my MIL called me to say I am cold-hearted for not helping carla and that I involve business in everything. I just don’t understand why are they making Carla’s lack of financial independence my problem when they can have her work and gain money then try to move forward with her dreams instead of asking me to fund her dreams for free. Now they are shifting this as if I don't consider Carla family because I help my bio daughter business through my company and while that's true my bio daughter and I have an agreement of  giving me 10% of the profit so I don't fund her for free either.",

	"body" : "This is not the first time we've made requests of my adult (intelligent) step daughter who's working as a server living with us the last 9 months after dropping out of college. She's usually the last one home at night & closing the door between the driveway & garage has become a challenge - several (5/6) times in the last 12 weeks it is inches ajar the next day.**There is no mechanical impediment to it closing**Recently I explained in cold weather mice/vermin/skunk are likely to come in & nest.  We asked her to close & lock the door hoping this would help follow through.Working long hours, we often don't see her for more than a few minutes in a day.  We've taken to texting photos of the messes left behind (she's a Grade-A slob) asking for her help/consideration.  She constantly apologizes without modifying her behavior to the point where my wife (her mom) told her some weeks back, \"I don't believe you, I don't believe you are sorry because you are not modifying your behavior\".  I began using this terminology myself.This resulted in occasions where I sent photos of, \"problems\" only for them to be ignored.  When confronted, we got the reply, \"well I didn't know what to say, because if I said I was sorry you wouldn't believe it, so I just said nothing.\"  We let her know that no reply was worse than any other option at all.She's been on our phone bill paying $15/mth for unlimited everything with a top tier carrier - the best phone deal anyone could have, but required nudging many months for payment - again - she is currently making $1,000+/wk.  It has been made clear to her that not responding to our texts and/or not staying current with her bill will result in dropping her from the plan.My wife has been out of town this week & we've had a really good week - I've been taking favorite, \"dinner requests\" from her for the nights she has been home. Low drama.Wednesday morning is literally freezing where we live & the garage door is open again - I text her a photo captioned ANNOYING! go work out & she's gone when I get home.  I do not get any text response all day - nothing.As the third parent in the mix my vote has (probably rightly) only ever carried little weight, but after suggesting she wasn't ready to go to college (& being overruled) & the following day suggesting it again when she was suddenly $4,400 short since the prior day... overruled again.  You see the pattern here?  No consequences... ever.I have stated that a different approach is the only way to get a different result.So, I lock the door she can't get in.  Instead of arriving home at 10 she gets home at midnight, I'm fast asleep - she can't get in & sleeps at friends.  Note we live somewhere very safe, I knew she had multiple friend options and that's what actually happened.I told her she needs to get her own phone bill, she's off ours.

I adore them, I have a good relationship with the younger two, the eldest (Damon) is still rather awkward around me. I'd say that I am their main carer, as Mar is paid enough at work to allow me to stay at home and focus on my art, and their mother, Christine, is always busy with shifts at her two jobs. It's gotten to the point that the youngest, Alma (F2), calls me 'daddy.'I have very solid beliefs, such as the belief that meat is unethical. I don't want anyone to bring meat into my house, when I got into a relationship with Mar, he became vegetarian. As a result, when the kids are here, the meals I cook for them contain no meat. Damon had no problem with it up until now, he complains at every given opportunity about the lack of meat. I've explained to him that eating meat is non-negotiable, he can eat it at his mother's. His father backed me up. I've tried to compromise by buying him 'beyond meat', but he still insists on actual meat.Another thing is that my husband is very affectionate to me and the kids, although Damon being 15 is embarrassed by that. The younger two always climb onto our laps for hugs, and Alma always wants to be carried around on my hip.I don't speak to Christine much, we're not on very good terms as she has been homophobic to me in the past and critical of my former job, so I was surprised when she wanted to speak to me when I dropped her kids off at her home. She demanded that I don't 'push' vegetarianism on her kids, to allow them to eat meat in our home, to which I told her that I don't dictate what food she cooks in her house, so she shouldn't do so to me. She also stated she was uncomfortable with Alma calling me 'daddy' and the affection I show to her kids.Asides from being vegetarian, I tried to respect her wishes and discourage Alma from calling me 'daddy' and I stopped letting her and river climb onto my lap or hug me. That didn't work out very well and I was left to deal with 2 confused and upset little kids to comfort, therefore I decided to go against their mother's wishes and let them carry on doing what they're used to. I feel conflicted because their mother's wishes have been disrespected, but at the same time, I'm just doing what's best for the kids, not what's best for her.edit ; idk why everyone assumes Damon is outright banned from meat, he does eat meat when he goes out with his father or his friends. shit, I even pay for it when he goes out to eat. the smell of meat nauseates me for a variety of reasons2nd edit : whoever the fuck is sending me messages making fun of my dead child, you are bottom feeders.",

Bridesmaids asked me to do whatever I needed to do and try to make something workI spoke with the band, and I asked if they were able to learn “True” by Ryan Cabrera, a relatively simple song with an hours notice, and a song I know my voice can handle. They were willing to and after a quick readjustment rehearsal with those actually walking down the aisle, minus Taylor, wedding happened. I perform the song, and although somewhat confused, Taylor seemed very happy. I then take place in my position as a groomsman.At the photos portion, Taylor came up to me and jumped me with a hug, thanking me for stepping in. She asked why I changed the song but after a brief explanation of how my voice wouldn’t have worked, she understood, and said she was happy I chose that song.Travis, on the other hand, was not very talkative to me. After the reception and following days, he ghosted me. After finally having enough I went over to his place to talk this out. This is where all went loose.He was very upset with me for changing the song, knowing it was Taylor’s favorite song and I couldn’t have sucked it up for literally 5 minutes. I defended by stating the following: 1. I was following Taylor’s ONE request for no track music. 2. My voice would have made any of the video footage taken ruined because the song didn’t fit my voice. 3. I chose another song that I KNOW he and Taylor loved and that I could actually sing. He basically removed all that by stating that I should have done what was requested in the first place. As soon as I mentioned how Taylor didn’t mind, he kicked me out.Several people are divided. Our friend group, aka the groomsmen, are taking Travis’ side and stating how I’m the jerk. The bridemaids, Taylor’s friends, are defending me for choosing a song that I could sing and was still wedding appropriate. Taylor has remained silent about this, as she is Travis’ wife, but know I did what I could.I genuinely don’t know what to make of everything. AITA??",

	"body" : "Throwaway because he knows my real username. Long-time lurker, first-time poster but situations like this keep happening with my husband, and I’m trying to keep a reality check as to whether I’m reading these situations accurately as I’m starting to feel crazy.We have two children - a 10M baby and daughter, 5F.Last night before bed we agreed that I would cover night wakes for the baby which I do every night,  and that Husband would get up with the kids in the morning and let me sleep in. I have my period and am tired at the start, crampy and really needed the extra sleep.We have been staying with his family for Christmas and have been here eight days, and I have gotten up with the baby in the night and then with the kids every morning while he has slept in until 9-10am every morning. His family do not come help me with the kids during this time either so it’s very much just me and the kids (they do help later in the day a great deal) which is absolutely fine with me.I haven’t complained once - simply asked if I could sleep in one morning when my period was at its worst.This morning rolls around and Husband was trying anything to get out of letting me sleep in and hasn’t stopped snapping at everyone. Snapped at our daughter when she came in at 7am so not too early to wake by any means, snapped at her when our son then started rustling to get up even though again 7am is a great wake time for them.Husband then started making passive aggressive comments towards me that he only slept three hours.It very much felt like he was trying to get me to say oh you stay in bed and I’ll get up with the kids, but I’ve done that everyday and likely will do it for the rest of this trip as well and that’s often after getting up in the night with the baby.During my sleeping in time, in the space of the not even three hours that I’ve slept in, he has barged in three times to ask me various questions and then snaps at me for answering saying I’m “interrupting” and to “stop questioning” him.I’m about to get up now and I’m sure he will be “shocked” I’m not taking advantage of my day to sleep in but when someone has come in multiple times and I know he will have been snapping at our daughter this whole time, it becomes difficult to get back to sleep.AITA??",

	"body" : "I absolutely adored my MIL up until I got pregnant, when she started acting weird. My husband is her youngest child (30) and the only one out of her children who didn't have any children so originally I thought she was just projecting her excitement over him finally having a baby in weird ways but that's definitely not it. She does not act like this at all with any of her other kids and she 100% never acted like this toward my husband UNTIL she found out I was pregnant (we announced it after we found out the gender).Anyways, she has always been a super modest, very conservative woman. She showed zero skin because it wasn't \"lady like\". She never ever made any hint of inappropriate comments. She never would have dreamed about discussing her bedroom life. It simply was not who she was, or so I thought. But after I got pregnant she started showing up to my house randomly 2-3 times a week and asking my husband to leave with her to go run errands and other miscellaneous stuff that she could 100% do herself, with the excuse of \"I figured you'd like to go with me and get out of the house\". That's not weird but then it amped up to her started to show up with her bust completely revealed and asking my husband if he liked her shirt or if he liked her pants that look like they were painted on. Doing little spins for him. Then started the comments about her BF being a drunk and not being able to \"get it up\" and complaining that she wasn't having her needs met and how she needed a real man. Started coming over with gifts of money and expensive watches, etc for my husband. Literally showed up to our baby shower with stuff for my husband, not the baby. Started bringing him food (just him, not me) saying \"I figured you missed Mama's cooking\" (he hates her cooking and it always hit the trash can when she left). I had our daughter 3 months ago and shes held her twice, despite coming here once a week to steal my husband away. But the tipping point was her coming here yesterday unannounced at 7am and told my husband \"we need to take your pubes and glue them to your head. We know you got plenty.\" (He's balding). He just kind of looked at her and said \"what the fuck? That's weird.\" He was wearing grey sweats with no underwear and shit was clearly visible. He immediately went and changed. His whole demeanor changed after that comment and he looked super uncomfortable but she laughed it off. She did however keep touching him (rubbing his arms and back). After she left I told him I really don't want her here anymore. She makes me uncomfortable and quite frankly, she's starting to gross me the fuck out. I asked how he felt about it and how she's been acting and he said \"I don't get it, this is not the mom I know. She's acting like I'm her fucking husband but I can't just tell her she can't come here. She was a single mom. I'm her baby, blah blah blah\". He said I'm wrong in asking that she not be allowed here anymore, despite agreeing that she's being over the top weird. I don't want her near my kid. AITA?ETA: as many have mentioned, I did consider this could be medically related to something. I honestly was leaning toward Dementia or Alzheimer's because I frequently see certain signs of this in my line of work (medical technician at a dementia unit). Dementia and Alzheimer's don't run in the family so originally I was fought on testing but she did agree to have a brain scan done a week ago because she was having migraines. My husband went with her to the appointment and the brain scan came back normal. From what my husband said, he did in fact ask the doctor if her scan showed any signs of possible deterioration that could be linked to Alzheimer's or Dementia and they said they had not seen any signs of that. She still acts completely normal at family functions when everyone else is around. Super reserved, not making inappropriate comments. When she's at my house and around my husband it's a completely different story. She acts like a nun in a cucumber patch.",

	"body" : "I (26F) recently moved into a 2 bedroom apartment with my boyfriend (25M) “Austin”. We lived together before but now we have a guest room. I WFH so my home is also my office.Austin is an only child, raised by his single mom (54F) “Emery”. He adores his mom to the end of the earth and she can do no wrong in his eyes. She left him living alone for months when he was 16/17 because she moved in with a bf, and I think my bf wants to make up for lost time.Emery recently visited us for 16 days, arriving 3 days after we moved in. During her trip, I realized that 16 days was way past my comfort zone.I particularly struggled with this because Emery shows zero interest in getting to know me. This was my 3rd time meeting her. With it being just the 3 of us for the first time, I realized that she barely acknowledged me. All questions and comments were directed at Austin. Body language, eye contact, etc. She was very closed off toward me. We brought her to a friend’s house for xmas and she acted like a different person. She was very talkative, bubbly, and charming with all of the friends present, and she had met them all that day.Being her son’s first gf in 10 years, I thought she would want to get to know me, but all questions about me were asked behind my back. One of my (gay) male friends FaceTimed me and I overheard her ask Austin who I was on the phone with. I mentioned getting my antidepressants refilled and later she asked Austin “why does she take antidepressants? What trauma does she have?”.  One of the first nights, she complained that she wasn’t sitting next to Austin, when I was sitting next to her. I felt self-conscious about my seat placement in my own home after that. I had a fight with Austin due to Emery having her friends fly in to stay with us and misinform us about the length of their stay. She overheard, so I apologized, and she did not speak a single word to me, in my own home, for four days.Austin and I discussed the burning question: should there be a maximum duration for guests in our house? This would apply to all guests. I think 5 days is generous, and in our state, a guest legally becomes a tenant after staying for 7 nights in a row. I do not want to give someone else tenants rights to my home. I said that if Emery wants to stay longer, she can get a hotel for the remaining days, but she cannot afford that and Austin does not want to pay for it.Austin said the one exception to this proposed rule would be Emery. I explained to him that’s not an exception, it is obliterating the rule because she’s the reason why I proposed it in the first place. He said this is a non-negotiable for him, and there is no maximum for how long his mom can stay with us. He said those 16 days were the happiest he’s been in 10 years. AITA for wanting to set a limit on that? It’s OUR home and I feel like we should compromise, but he will not budge.

Recently, I made plans with one of my friends I've known for pretty much my whole life since her birthday is coming up. I told my parents about this maybe a month before the actual event came up and they promised me I could go, no matter what.A few days ago, I was getting ready to leave and my parents ask me what I'm doing. I tell them and suddenly it switches up to them saying I can't go because I need to take care of my pregnant mother while my dad (45m) meets up with his friends at a bar. I don't know why, but I think this made me snap? On top of always cooking dinner because my dad can't cook and my mom isn't able to because she feels sick, going to the store by myself because my mom can't be alone, getting my phone taken because I need to focus on my mom, and not being allowed to have basically any time to myself, this must have been my last straw. It felt like I couldn't control my words. I told my mom, \"I'm not the one who got you pregnant, I don't even want a sister, so why do I need to take care of you when you have a perfectly able husband?\" I couldn't do much else because they just stared at me as I ran back to my room to call my friend and tell her what happened and that I couldn't go.After that, I've barely come out of my room and my dad has started slipping index cards under my bedroom door telling me I need to apologize because my mom thinks I hate her and that I'm ungrateful for this oppritunity to grow as a person and I should be happy to have a little sibling on the way. I can understand she's emotional and stressed, she's growing a whole other human inside her body, but I don't understand why they need to make my mom and this baby my responsibility?

I will not name my roommate out of the very little respect I still have for him, but in all honesty I wanted to kick him out even before this all happened; and, this was my final straw.For some background, I had an ad up on Craigslist in 2020 looking for a roommate because at the time I was much lower on money. He ended up applying and we met and had our arrangements sorted so that we were housed together. I didn't really like his personality but I kept it relatively to myself because of my financial situation. He was messy, almost never cleaned up after himself, he was really rude and inappropriate (making odd flirtatious comments about me even after I rebuffed his advances, but he called it all a \"joke\") to put it simply.All was normal until about 3 years after he moved in (Early-mid 2023) he suddenly stopped paying his part of the rent and had a different excuse every time, mostly things like \"I'm looking for a job!\" and such. I let it slide because I was a bit more financially stable (even though he was setting me back quite a bit). But then months had passed, and he had the same excuses and I grew tired of him. Like I said, I did plan on kicking him out regardless, but the next situation was the last straw.At the time, I was seeing some guy for a while and had a date. I really, really liked him. I was stoked, and I mentioned it once to my roommate. This was a big mistake. Behind my back while I was in the shower, my roommate somehow got the passcode to my phone correctly and WENT THROUGH IT. I don't know if he saw the texts or was planning it anyway, but he completely sabotaged my relationship with the guy I was seeing and thought it was SO hilarious.He apparently told the guy I was MTF transgender (I am not, but I am an ally) and the guy got uncomfortable and blocked me ever since. Not only did I find it absolutely disgusting that he used the LGBT as the butt of his joke, I was absolutely furious that he crossed my boundary this much because of his own jealousy. I blew up on him and kicked him out, and ever since then he has been gone, and I cut all contact.That was 5 months ago. A couple days ago, he has shown up at my doorstep with an apology. I personally do not accept this apology because what he did was utterly inexcusable, in my opinion, but he is trying to tell me he has no family, nowhere else to go, and if I don't let him stay, he will be homeless.I do not plan on letting him back in with me, but I think I may be an asshole for letting him stay homeless.",

Everyone was elated and in my eyes both my adoptive parents and bio dad and step mom were equally my child's grandparents.Fast forward to when I was 9 months pregnant and could pop any day.

In response, my mom wrote a post about how family is family no matter how were related and if we love each other that's all that matters. One of the extended family members said that my adoptive mom treats my sister and I seperate from her own biological children (the only reason why we're treated different is each of us have our own special needs. For example, I have anxiety, depression and ptsd. One sibling is autistic, another has bpd. We all have different needs). I told this person \"tell us honestly how you see any of us raised unfairly compared to any other SIBLING. You sound stupid sitting there repeating yourself so if you feel that you get to have a say in the first place then defend it, otherwise shut up\"This offended her (insert eye roll here) and she messaged me literally an hour after I had given birth telling me I need to respect my elders and what I said was rude.

	"body" : "My husband and I bought a house when rates were very low, in a less than desirable location, and well under our means. My siblings were less than impressed with the location and had said they would never live in such a city, but good for us. Fast forward a year, the siblings that had originally judged the location moved in under the pretense that they needed a place to stay until they could get back on their feet. They also brought their families, so space was very cramped. Initially they could not pay into the mortgage, but after a few months we got into a groove and they started to contribute to “the rent.” My husband and I paid for the bills and about 50%-70% of the mortgage, and I saved their rent money to help in their eventual move. Fast forward another two years and my SO and I moved for work. We ended up purchasing a second home and left the first for my family to use until they got on their feet. This unfortunately meant they had to pay the full mortgage amount plus their bills as well. We refinanced to lower the payment and make it more manageable, but they have never paid the full amount and I ended up paying the remainder. Over the next two and a half years my credit cards have maxed out and my credit has taken a significant hit from making up the difference. I’ll also note that after buying the second home I quit my job to care for my LO. This was intentional. I’ve always been calculated with big life decisions, which is why I opted to have children later in life once I had secured an alternative form of income other than working. My intention was to use our first house as a rental property, though for obvious reasons this didn’t work out as planned. Well now we need to move again and we’ve decided to sell our first home as it has the most equity. Unfortunately, my siblings and their families are faced with the incredibly difficult task of finding a home at the price point they were renting my home for, and now I think they’re all upset with me (and maybe rightfully so). I’ve offered assistance but have yet to hear from them. Their silence has always been an issue as well because too many times have simple fixes around the house ballooned into more complex and expensive issues due to their lack of communication. I feel very bad for putting them in this position, but we simply can’t afford to house them any longer. They have no disabilities that stop them from getting jobs, they simply don’t have the skills, motivation or education to get high paying jobs. They also have a preference for living in more expensive locations than what they can reasonably afford, and they’ve made terrible financial decisions in the last few years (think buying a new car, then trading it in a couple of years later for another newer car, maintaining an expensive habit, etc). I’m also reluctant to allow them to stay in my second home, as that mortgage is higher than the one they already weren’t affording.

They both worked full-time and would say they are too tired but so did me and my mom.I had to sleep on an air mattress in the living room while they were here, as our house only has three bedrooms.It sounds selfish but I'm glad they are out of the house. My mom gives them money every month to help them with their utilities, and pays for their phone bills and internet bill.In November, my mom asked Alex if she could take the kids to this meet Santa event before Christmas and he agreed. A couple days prior to the event, they had an argument over the phone as Alex had assumed my mom would be paying, when actually she expected Alex to pay. FYI it was like 10 dollars per child. Alex said to just forget it as the kids are not going, and he told our mom that she needs to \"set her priorities straight\".Alex was actually way angrier about this than I thought as he and his wife just didn't turn up to our home on Christmas when they said they would and when my mom called them, they said they \"forgot\". They turned up the next day and took the presents for the kids and left after 5 minutes, saying they had other plans. This really upset my mom and after they left she was crying.Im just been fed up with Alex's behavior and upsetting our mom, and yesterday I confronted him in person as he was complaining about how he and his wife feel \"unsupported by the family\" with their kids. I said he needs to grow up and either be more grateful or stop depending on our mom, and he needs to apologise to her. He said it's none of my business and it's not like he's forcing her to give them money, she can stop if she wants. I said that's not the point and he's acting like a spoiled brat. He started cussing me out and called me a f*cking idiot, and said to stay in my own lane.Alex has since refused to talk to me and his wife said I'm not allowed to be around their kids because of my \"toxic behavior\". My mom is mostly on my side but she said it wasn't my place to say anything. AITA?",

My friends judge me for it and so does my family because they think it’s weird since I’m African American and I can’t understand the lyrics.It’s been happening since the beginning of the year and it has become very annoying.A few weeks ago, I was the only one at home and I was doing my chores. I wanted to listen to music, so I decided to and I didn’t put my AirPods on since I was the only one at home. I was listening to my K-pop playlist. So as I’m cleaning the kitchen, the door bell rang and it was my mom.I opened it, but the music was still on. My mom rolled her eyes and told me to turn it off, but I didn’t and decided why not just put my AirPods on. But she yelled “No, turn off the music!”So I said “you won’t hear it if I have my AirPods in” she got upset and took my phone saying “I don’t know why you listen to them Chinese people anyway, you don’t know what their saying and you won’t ever get noticed by them” She said she was tired of me spending my money on albums and making plans to go to concerts. One day she even ripped one of my posters off the wall because she felt one of the members had too much make up on. You know how crazy that is???So I told her that whatever I listened to SHOULDNT concern her. Because it’s just music—- pop music in another language and it’s not like I was trying to become an idol…or even fake to be Korean. I listen to all genres and I’m still African American.She called me “Asian-washed” and told me I was nothing like a black kid. I told her that she would be the reason I’d move out and never visit because she can’t let a child be. I told her she’s lucky I’m not roaming around the streets with vapes and having sexual interactions with other people.She called kpop useless and I was grounded for three days.It made me upset and it was hard communicating with her. But I ofc had no other choice but to. When I got my phone back, I saw that my K-pop playlist was gone. I asked her why she did it and she said she was sick and tired of having a black child wanting to be another ethnicity.I told her she was stressing me out and I couldn’t wait to move out because I was tired of having someone as judgmental as her of a mother. am I in the wrong here?",

I was sitting across from their father during the dinner and one of his kids asked me what I did for work. I said it probably wasn’t very good to talk about right then.For context, I’m in college studying to become a forensic pathologist and I intern at my local coroners office. So, I work with dead people. It’s a tough job and I know for many it’s an uncomfortable topic but I focus on the good im doing, which makes it a lot easier. My boyfriend told me I probably shouldn’t talk about it at the dinner, and I said I wouldn’t so long as it wasn’t brought up. Cause I don’t want to lie.Their father insisted, so I pulled him aside to tell him that I worked at a coroners office, and I didn’t think his kids would want to hear about it. He said her kids were mature enough to handle it, and seemed offended that I thought otherwise. I took his word for it, so I tried to give a child friendly description of it. Saying that was sorta like a detective who figures out how people died.This might be where in the asshole. After dinner, the oldest kid talked to me one on one and started asking me questions about it. I tried to keep it as PG as I could, but at one point he asked me if I got to cut open bodies like on TV. I said that it was a bit outside my pay grade, but I helped. He thought it was awesome, and ran off.I guess he told his siblings about it because today I got a very strongly worded message from their mother about how I “told her young children about how I played with dead bodies” and now their youngest is terrified. Apparently she’s mad at my boyfriend too for dating someone with such a dark job.I was just answering a kids questions. He was mature enough to ask about it, and he clearly already knew it happened, so I don’t really see the harm in telling him the truth. And I don’t see how it’s my fault his siblings found out.

I have three children, two boys and we just had a baby girl at the end of December.  My sister has a daughter and son, and my brother has two girls. Now when it comes to gift giving in our family, we only do it for the children twice a year, birthdays and Christmas. And nothing too expensive either.However, the last few years, my brother and his family have stopped giving gifts to my kids and my sisters kids.  With that being said, my sister and I have continued to give gifts to my brother’s two girls.  Now, if they were short on money or going through a rough time, we would completely understand.  However, my brother and his family either say they forgot and will get something in the future (which they never do) or make the excuse that they didn’t know they were supposed to get a gift.   We’ve even told them that even just a card from the dollar store would mean a lot, however that seems to fall on deaf ears.Also, my brothers two girls never appreciate any of the gifts they get.  Not to mention, the attitude of my brother and his wife doesn’t help the situation either.  Here is what I mean.  If you were to give the two girls a gift, then either it gets completely destroyed, lost or my brother and his wife will throw it away when it’s in perfect good condition.  A gift card or cash?  Gets lost and they don’t care where it is.  Clothes?  My brothers wife refuses to do laundry, the clothes get damaged and then they just throw it away when the girls have maybe worn it once or twice.  Books?  Get ripped and destroyed. Even second hand and homemade gifts are just tossed aside with my brother’s family. I cross-stitch for a hobby and can do lots of different projects.  Christmas stockings, wedding dates, welcome baby ones, the list goes on.  Well they really wanted baby date ones for their two girls and so I obliged and made that for them.   But where are they now?  Sitting in a closet, collecting dust and getting damaged when they keep piling stuff on top of it; which hurts me personally since I put so much work into them. The other members of my family don’t know what to do.  My parents don’t want to stir the pot, cause they know my brothers wife is very touchy and she is the gate keeper to their son. Tick her off and my brother will not speak to you until there’s been an apology to his wife; even if you are in the right and she is wrong.I personally feel like I am just done with it all.  I will still buy gifts for my sisters children and mine, but for my other two nieces?  Nope.

Rob was complaining to us about his relationship troubles with his recently wed wife, Kayla (F35).Rob and Kayla have a complicated past, but I'll do my best to summarize. They met and started dating about a bit more than a decade ago. After about two years of dating, Kayla dumped Rob, as she thought they weren't a good match. Rob was devastated so he didn't really pursue any relationships after that point aside from a few short flings.Rob and Kayla met again earlier this year after Kayla divorced her husband. After chatting with Rob for a few months, they got married, and she along with her two kids (M7 and F5) moved in with Rob. Trust me, this all seemed rushed to me and my other friends, but Rob wasn't having any of it, as according to him, Kayla the kids are his pride and joy and he loves them more than anything.Now, after being married for a few months, Rob seems a little disillusioned with the relationship. He says he loves Kayla and the kids with all his heart, but working full-time, being a husband, and father exhausts him. This reached a boiling point. He told us about how the day before yesterday, he and Kayla had an argument. She thought he didn't do enough around the house. He argued that he was exhausted from work, playing with the kids and helping them with their homework, etc. They argued but long story short, it ended with him getting sentenced to the couch.Rob was fuming, but my other friends and I told him that the only way to get off the couch was by apologizing and admitting fault. My other friends agreed with me since we've all been there. He said that he wanted to wait and see if Kayla would attempt to communicate first, but I told him that was futile. When he insisted he'd wait, I laughed and told him it was useless. Rob seemed offended and said I was an asshole for \"making light of his situation.\" Despite all this, Rob was somewhat happy since he was \"relieved\" that Kayla felt comfortable enough with dishing out the sentence. But nonetheless, he was pissed with it.The night ended shortly afterward. When I got home, my wife wasn't impressed that I laughed at him being sent to the couch. She said it was different for Rob compared to myself and my other friends since he and Kayla's relationship is more \"complex\". She said that it was rude, but I honestly don't see it considering how Rob got himself into this mess and can easily get himself out of it.AITA?",

I have one child that is not his biologically (F7) but that is still her daddy and she calls him as such. He loves her like his own and it's honestly been such a blessing and so endearing to watch. We also have a daughter together (F3). And a bundle of joy on the way!So over the Christmas stretch while everyone was home, me and my fiance, Ryan decided to have a get together at our home. All together it was his 2 siblings, my 3 siblings, his nephew both of my parents and his mother so 9 guest plus our family of 4. Our families love eachother and get along wonderfully except for hie mother. This story pretty much just involves his mom who I will call MIL.The family gets together on the 26th  and is having a pretty good time. My brother pulled me to the side and told me that MIL had made a couple of racist comments towards him ans my parents and also started questioning why \"our people\" would get so offended by the n-word. I told him I'd handle it later but I did not want to spoil the party. About an hour later things have picked back up and my MIL is playing with my oldest and I hear her say \"oh don't you wish that you had hair like (3y/o) and not some heavy braids\" and before I could get there saying \"you look like your mommy but would be prettier if you had skin like daddy and (3 y/o)\" now, my oldest looks like me with pretty dark skin. While my youngest looks exactly like her father...and honestly dosent even look mixed.When I heard these comments I saw RED I took my kids and nephew up to the playroom came back down and told MIL to get \"the hell out of my house and never come back\" when my fiance heard the commotion and I told him what happened he was LIVID we kicked my mother in law out without much fight back from her. I apologized to both families and they said it wasnr my fault and understood and we continued to have a great time.For the past week my MIL has been blasting me on evert social media platform saying im a bitch and everything under the sun. Mt FH has been completely on my side and we sent her a message together about her not being able to see the children anymore and she's blasted and calling me a horrible mother and threatening me. FH father and one brother are angry with me but otherwise people are mostly on my side om starring to think I went a little overboard with everything. And feel bad about my kids not seeing her anymore espically with a new baby on rhe way. AITA?Edit: thank you guys for all the advice and for all the love. I'll write an actual update soon but long story short we ended up going VERY low contact with MIL after she said she was wearing a bridal gown to my wedding because she's \"the real prize\" but anyway.

The engaged couple intend to marry in the fiancés home country and then return to our home country.This will require myself, my partner and my partner’s parents to fly in order to attend.The issue that has arisen is they have  proposed a wedding date in the immediate future that significantly conflicts with our respective lives. To explain:Both my partner and I have jobs that wouldn’t allow us to book time off specifically around the date they’ve proposed. We would need to catch red-eye flights and arrive on the day of with little to no sleep involved. This is a non-negotiable conflict, neither of us can take a few days off beforehand given our professions.My partner’s parents have a pre-existing scheduling conflict that would allow them to attend. However, they would essentially arrive a few days before, attend, and then leave.The engaged couple do have an urgency to their wedding and I can understand that. However, I do not understand why they cannot get court room married and then plan a destination ceremony allowing everyone to attend comfortably without the stress. To me, given the urgency, these events can be separate and do not have to be done simultaneously.I feel like we are being forced into a rock and a hard place - we want to attend, but will not be able to present our best selves. My partner is willing to endure because it’s their sibling, but, I am of the opinion we will likely be so stressed out and burnt out that we will fight and not have a good time whatsoever.Naturally I do not have any info from my partner’s fiancés side on why they’ve chosen the proposed date. So perhaps there is a more significant driving force on their end.So WITBA if I put my foot down and say “I’m sorry, but your proposed wedding date does not work with my schedule”.",

We bring food we'd bought or cooked during the day, like Thanksgiving dinner in the west. But this year, my aunt (62f) decided we're gonna have the dinner at a seafood restaurant. My mom (55f) and I (27f) are allergic to seafood. I get mild rash on arms/legs when I eat shellfish, and hives, swollen lips, tingling throat when I eat finned fish. My mom gets rash on her face and headache. That said, we still sometimes eat shellfish since our reaction to those aren't severe, and chuck our meds right after. But we generally avoid finned fish dishes.My aunt sent the menu in the group chat when we were working. The set menu consists of 10 dishes, 8 of which are finned fish and shellfish, 1 carbs, and 1 beef platter. Only 1 person replied yes and in less than an hr, she booked tables for all of us with non-refundable down payment. When we found out, we were a little upset, especially my mom. But since there's 1 beef dish we could eat, we thought alright we'll just eat that with rice.Then we came to find out that this place is a live steam-yourself place, meaning we have to steam the food at our table like hotpot or bbq place. This changed everything cause that means the beef will be steamed where seafood are (cross contamination). My mom complained, telling my dad (63m) how selfish my aunt is for booking a place without getting a \"yes\" from everyone in the group. My dad asked my aunt to change some of the dish, but it's impossible since it's the LNY package. This package is also hella expensive (close to $2000 total) compared to what we usually spend for LNY dinner at grandma's house.She'd paid $300 DP so she really doesn't want to cancel the reservation. My aunt shot back at my mom saying we should've told her we're allergic to seafood before she booked it. But we were working?? And it was still office hour when she sent the text in the group chat. At this, my mom decided to opt out of the dinner altogether. I side with my mom ofc. Out of 10 dishes, there's essentially NOTHING we could eat without getting allergy reaction, and my dad is still expected to chip in for 3 people (me, him, and mom). My aunt spammed the chat saying we could just order something else even though it's charged extra; it's ridiculous.I can handle some rash if they're all shellfish, but I am so not looking forward to have swollen lips on that day, on ANY day. My dad's upset too. He thinks we're overreacting since he'd agreed to pay extra for us to order something else. But honestly who wants to eat at separate table with only beef and fried rice, while the rest enjoy a grand feast? Now some of them are miffed at us cause according to them, they've tried to accomodate us but we refuse their kind gesture. I can't believe the audacity.  AITA here? Seriously are we?",

But  I would say we have drifted apart and now she only messages me when she wants something. The last year has been really hard on me. My grandfather died of cancer, my best friend of twenty years ended our friendship abruptly and I have had multiple seizures sometimes back to back to back. Earlier this year her dogs [multiple] died suddenly and when it happened in August I was there for her.I sent her a sympathy card, stayed up late with her on skype just listening to her vent and even got her an ornament of her dogs to give her some comfort. I did this several times and even would randomly call her just to remind her that I love her and that I am here for her. I listened every time she recited the horrible story of how her dogs died; no matter how upset it made me. I now know where she was, when and how it happened and could easily recite it by heart. I understand she was traumatized which is why I feel awful.But  here's the thing, A has never been the best pet owner, she never fixes her pets or takes them to the vet but has money for things like plushies and comic books, and her dog had been sick for months. I begged her to take the dog to the vet but she sighted she can't afford it. And then back in November around thanksgiving I got a skype call from my grandfather. He was 90 years old and dying of cancer and although I only got 10 yrs with him [he lived in a third-world country] I was so close to him. I had the worst thanksgiving ever and when he said goodbye he even asked me to tell him it was ok to go.Last week, A called me and wished me a happy new year; she was late but whatever. She asked me how I was and I told her that I will be ok but it's my first year without him in the last decade. She asked me if I was okay and I said \"not really,\"  and that I am struggling. Here's where I might be the asshole, she said, \"Yeah I know how you feel my dog left a hole too.\" and proceeded to recount the way her dogs died *yet again.*I told her, \"Yes I know but can we not talk about this again? I really need to vent and it's not the same as losing a pet.\" I know she misses them but I am grieving and really just needed someone to listen to me; I know she isn't my therapist but come on.And she told me that the pain of losing my grandfather was *equal* to the pain of losing my grandfather because she was just as traumatized as I am. I lost it, I just lost it.  I snapped at her, \"I don't CARE that your dog's died! I get it! THEY DIED! Can we focus on me for Once?! My grandfather is dead!\" and I broke down crying while she called me an asshole and hung up leading to a barrage of texts calling me a heartless asshole.  Was I though?

We’ll call her “Claire”.Claire was a year above me and we never interacted at all through school, we had no mutual friends or anything linking us together. I now regularly post covers and my own songs on my social media and although I don’t really have any following, I love what I do and try to post regularly (a New Year’s resolution of mine also hahah!).I recently received a message from Claire asking me to sing at her wedding. Honestly, I was honoured. I’ve never been asked to sing at someone’s wedding before and it would be the first truly personal occasion I’ve sang at.I asked Claire firstly what she wanted to be sung in regards to was it just the first dance or walking down the aisle or fully singing for the reception. I also asked her to let me know what songs she wanted, regardless of when they were sung, so I could best tell if I was going to be the best singer. The last thing I’d want to do is agree and then do a terrible job singing a song I’m not confident in at the most important day of someone’s life!! She messaged back and said it would be for the first dance AND for at least 2 hours of the reception before a DJ took over.I proceeded to let her know that, as this would be the first occasion I’ve done such an event, I would do it for £90 an hour. In total, she needed me for 3/4 hours. I really don’t think I was asking for what a lot of other bands/singers would ask for (please correct me if I’m wrong!!)She messaged back with shock, and said she assumed I’d do it for free as I’m “just a pub singer” and I’m “not exactly making money” as it was. I was taken aback. I then said I’d do it for £70 an hour if she was willing to compromise. She insisted I do it for free and said she would make sure I was given food and drink at the wedding to compensate.I’ve now told her I won’t be singing at her wedding as I feel I’ve given her a deal and she’s asking for too much.She said she would tell all her friends about me and post my social media if I did it for free, but I just don’t know if that’s justifiable?As I’m not a seasoned professional, I’m now wondering if I was wrong in my pricing?

I asked him why he thought he could demand that from me and he said something like Dawn is doing the job of a second mom and deserves to be recognized and loved as such, instead of the kids just seeing her as a dad's wife and comes in last stepmom which is how they treat her. He said they do not treat her equally to us and it hurts her feelings and she is so wonderful that she deserves better.I don't strictly agree with that because Dawn has been rude/standoffish to me over the years I have known her and has treated me like I am in my kids lives to spite her instead of thinking I might, shockingly, love my children. She has made comments in an attempt to minimize my role in my kids' lives. Including the fact my kids look nothing like me. But she's also bitter that the kids have my last name and not Jake's (and now hers). She started a war with Jake's family over me and the kids too. So I think she's not really looking at the best interest of the kids, but the best interests of her wishes. And for that reason I do not plan to encourage my kids to call her mom but if they did so on their own I wouldn't correct them.I told my ex this and he said I'm just as bad if I can't see that Dawn deserves to be treated with love and respect and to be acknowledged as their third parent and second mom. I snarkily asked him when he was going to encourage the kids to find a second dad and fourth parent. He got pissy and told me to grow up and behave like a parent and an adult and treat him with the respect I seem to think I'm deserving of.My comment made things between us more tense and he has been testy with me since.

	"body" : "My husband and I are going to an indoor waterpark resort for a few days. We're taking his bio Avery 14 my bio Robin 9 and ours Alex 2. This will be the first time since covid that we've been able to do something like this with the kids.Avery wants to invite a friend to go with us for the weekend. I'm not a fan of this and told my husband that. When Avery does invite a friend over, they and the friend stay locked in the bedroom, gaming, talking, refusing to come out to talk or eat with everyone else and it feels like other than the noise they make, they might as well not even be here. We're lucky if Avery speaks more than 10 words to us the whole weekend when they bring a friend over.That said, I told my husband I'm really worried about that being what happens if Avery brings a friend on the trip. Avery will spend all the time with their friend and none with us, and with this being our first time away since covid I really want it to be family time. My husband said that he'd set rules that Avery and friend would get some time during the day to do their own thing, but the rest of the time would be doing things all together. It's not even the case at home, so why would that be the case now, but if he's positive he can make that happen, go ahead.My husband called Avery (we were both talking to her) and told them the rules and expectations. Avery said sure no problem, then said the friend they originally invited couldn't go, so they invited a new friend they recently made. (That's not a big deal and it happens.) I asked Avery this new friend's name (Avery said Jade, and for the parent's phone number. Avery started saying it's fine, Jade's parent's don't mind if they go with us, and besides they don't even know Jade's parents numbers, but they promise it's fine. At that point my husband told Avery to call or text Jade, get their parents number and get it to him by the end of the day.We've never met Jade or their parents, and I wasn't sure if it was a good idea to bring a kid we hadn't met trip and I said as much. Anyway, 11pm rolls around and Avery texts their dad that they didn't get Jade's parents number but it's still OK because it's fine for Jade to go and their parents don't mind.I said to my husband that I don't agree with taking another child several hours away without at least talking to the parents and making sure they dont mind and know where we will be and how to contact us directly. My husband agrees and told Avery that and since they didn't get us a way to contact Jade's parents they are no longer allowed to bring a friend on the trip. Avery is upset and blames me for ruining the trip for them and told us they're going to have the worst weekend of their life. My husband feels bad for how Avery feels but says he does agree with me. And I just feel bad about it all around. AITA??sorry if it's hard to read. tried to keep things as gender neutral as possible for privacy reasons and I'm on mobile.edit: looks like things blew up. Avery told their mom that Jade was going with us to the waterpark and it was all good with Jade's parents. Bio mom called my husband to confirm and we said no, that we didn't have a way to contact Jade's parents and talk to them so we'd said that Avery could not bring Jade. Bio mom didn't have Jade's parents contact info either, but she had their email addresses because the 2 kids have classes together. Bio mom emailed Jade's parents asking for their number and giving them her number and my husband's. Jade's parents called bio mom to thank her for taking Jade for the weekend because they had a family issue to attend to. Bio mom told them that Jade isn't staying at her house, Avery had invited Jade to waterpark several hours away with my husband and me. Jade's parents called my husband to ask what the hell is going on. We ended up telling them Avery had invited Jade but had not provided us with any contact info so we ended up telling Avery no to bringing Jade along. Jade's parents were so confused, they thought Jade was staying with Avery at bio mom's house, but then bio mom had no idea that Jade was supposedly staying there and the parents had absolutely no idea about the waterpark thing at all. Now Jade is grounded by their parents and has to go with them to deal with a family situation. And bio mom and my husband grounded Avery for lying and they're no longer allowed to go to the waterpark either.",

They think I’m being irrational and keep bringing up the fact that they’ve already booked everything for the wedding. My husband offered to pay them back but his younger brother said it wasn’t about the money but the fact that I was being ridiculous and that he [my husband] let me lead him around by his dick (whatever that means).

She rarely wants anything, and when she does want something, it's either impossible for me (an unemployed 17 year old) to get, or she already plans to buy it for herself a few days after she mentioned it. This year, I manged to get out of her that she wanted three specific pairs of earrings for the 3 piercings she has on each ear (small hoops, slightly larger hoops, and some nice pretty dangly ones, all sliver)She doesn't order jewellery online, and the specific sizes she was looking for are pretty hard to find in the usual places she shops, so she couldn't just get them herself (for a while at least). So I looked around, found and bought all three pairs in November.Fast forward to 5 days before Christmas, she has an event that she wants to go to and mentions that it would be nice if she had those earrings she wanted to go to the function. She talked about how they would be 'just perfect' with her outfit for the event. I briefly considered giving them to her then for an early Christmas, but we always save the presents for the big Day, so I didn't.On Christmas day, she opened the gift and loved it, she made a big deal of taking off the earrings she was wearing and putting them on for everyone to see. She was really happy about them. An hour after that, she came up to me and asked when I had bought them, and I told her it was on Black Friday. She asked, \"So you had them the whole time? And you let me go to that function without them?\" She started sounding upset, so I asked her if she was. \"Of course I'm fucking upset, why didn't you give them to me when I WANTED them? You could have given them to me when I needed them, you didn't have to wait till Christmas.\" She's been murmuring things to that effect well into the next day, and I'm starting to think she was right, but other family members think she's overreacting.

He  he continued to make negative little comments about her to my son. What put me over the edge was as he was leaving he made it a point to come back into the house, call out my sons name and say \"maybe your sister will grow a ding dong\". I said \"No, she's a girl and if you don't like it, you won't be around\". I grew up with a grandparent who blatantly favored the boys over us girls. We were nothing to her, so it broke my heart to hear this about my unborn daughter. Literally bawled my eyes out the rest of that night. The week after that he stopped over uninvited/unannounced and demanded to speak to me. (Husband told his mother how upset we were with all his negative comments and how I grew up with that.) I tried to avoid him, but he came up to me and said \"what, you're not going to talk to me?\" I replied \"I have nothing nice to say to you\". He says \"wow really?\" I repeated \"I have nothing nice to say to you right now\". He lost his shit. Started calling me a Fing B* and how I'm \"showing my true colors\". I continued to repeat \"I have nothing nice to say to you\" (mind you, my toddler is on my hip the entire time this man is cussing and berating me). Now I'm livid. We haven't seen him in over 2 months as he hasn't been welcome at our house.( He also sent a letter a week later stating my husband and son are no longer patients at his medical practice). MIL has only seen our son twice since, because  she \"feels bad\" seeing him when her husband can't. He denies doing anything wrong, luckily my husband heard EVERYTHING.l Anyway, MIL asked my husband what we wanted for our son for Christmas so he sent her a link to one of those indoor wooden climbing gyms for toddlers. We thought it would be perfect for him to stay active during winter and when the new baby arrives. My husband attended his family's Christmas (son and I did not go) but his mother would not let him bring the gift home for our son, saying \"I want to give it to him\". Totally cool, I completely understand that. We invite her over to our house for Christmas eve, she won't come. She decided (because FIL went out of town) to come over just the other day. My husband asks where the wooden gym was and she says \"I want your father to be there and give it to him too\". Neither my husband or MIL want to tell this man he's in the wrong. I honestly don't see anything changing in the near future, so I ordered the climbing set myself. It comes in next week. AITAH?",

We're civil with each other but don't really have much in common. She's always been vocal about how she doesn't believe in god and ghosts and other supernatural stuff like that and I actually share her views.Now this is where the problem arose. While we were having lunch the topic of deceased relatives was brought up. I told them about an uncle of mine who died during the pandemic in 2021 due to covid.

I'd call and talk to him almost everyday. So when I lost him, I honestly feel like I lost a piece of myself. I told them that once we were done with the funeral rites for him, my family and I were sitting around when the light in the room went off all of a sudden and I felt something on my head almost like a light touch from someone's hand. It was probably just the wind but I truly did think that was a sort of final farewell from my uncle.When I finished, my friends thought it was rather sweet....except for Kim.

My daughter has been living on her own, but after her friend passed away, she asked me if it was okay to stay at my house for a while because she didn’t want to feel lonely and she was feeling very depressed. Of course, I accepted and she has been staying in the guest room for about two weeks.Over the past two weeks, my spoons, forks, knives, plates, bowls AND cups have been going missing. I had a feeling that it was Adriana, so I kindly told her that if she had any dishes in her room, she could bring them to the sink so I could wash them. Well, no dishes appeared in the sink, but I did notice something shiny in the trash that day. I saw a fork poking out from underneath a pile of used paper towels. I pulled out the paper towels, which revealed a plate with food on it, a fork and a knife.I took the plate and walked to the guest room and asked Adriana if she had thrown out the plate. She started telling me that she did and that she was sorry. I told her that it wasn’t acceptable for her to just throw away my things! I have plastic, paper, glass and ceramic plates. She was throwing out my expensive ceramic plates instead of using the paper or plastic ones. I was very upset with her, but I asked her why. Her reasoning was that since she has been very depressed, she hasn’t had the energy to wash her dishes or put them in the sink. Instead, she just throws them away in the trash then wipes down the counters and throws the used paper towels on top.I was beyond angry when she told me she has been doing this since she has been staying with me, which means most of the items she threw away are gone. This is where I think I may have gone wrong. I told her that if she didn’t repay me for the dishes by the end of the week (about $120) that she is going to have to go back to staying at her own place. She started yelling at me and telling me that I should be understanding and that I don’t understand what she is going through right now.

The thing she wanted was very tiny and wouldn't take more than 10 minutes for me to do, and I told her I'd charge less than the minimum price I usually have.Typically the minimum is $80, but I said I'd do it for $50. She seemed shocked that I'd charge her at all and even though my gf backed me up a bit, I'm starting to feel really guilty.Should I change my mind and say I'll do it for free? I'd like to add that I pay for my own supplies and even though the design is very small and simple, I would still have to do a full set up and use supplies like I do for any tattoo. AITA?Update: I know I didn't post this long ago, but I ended up chatting with gf's mom again about 45 minutes ago and she brought it up again, then proceeded to insult me by saying I have too many tattoos and if I get anymore I won't look feminine. I mentioned I'd give her a discount like we talked about before and she just started saying too many would \"make me not beautiful anymore\" so my gf just apologized on her behalf and we left. :/After we left, my gf started crying in the car and basically let loose that her mom is really critical about women's looks and said some really hurtful things to her in the past about her facial features. Her mom also apparently keeps trying to push my gf to have plastic surgery and that's why they're somewhat low contact. I was shocked and comforted her (and I'd like to point out that she's gorgeous), but my initial issue is definitely not a problem anymore since I won't be doing that woman any favors.I appreciate the responses!",

He started screaming that I was being a \"bitch\" for not paying for all of his food even though I'm now \"rich as fuck\".

She was describing this dress that I have only wore once and it’s so pretty and one of my faves. I’ve been wanting to wear it again but an occasion hasn’t occurred. I say no you cannot wear it. She says please and that everyone will be wearing something really nice. I was firm on the no and told her if she wants to wear something nice then go buy something.

My husband's (M 32) parents heard about this and first started suggesting I instead cook at their house, so they can host.  Admittedly, they have a larger space for entertaining, but this party would only be for 6, which can more than comfortably fit in my own dining space.  This was the first bit that kinda irked me.

Saying what I mentioned before, that they have more space, and they were simply trying to be nice.The next issue was with what I planned on making for the meal.  I skipped the December holidays last month because I wanted to do something extraordinary for this.

This set me off and I kinda rudely said no, giving the above info as context for my answer.TLDR: Family visiting, I wanted to cook a fancy meal at my house, but husband and his parents made arguments against us, and now they're going out to dinner and I'm refusing to join.AITA?",

I moved in with my boyfriend a couple of months ago which was a little earlier than we had planned but we both wanted to get away from the comments. We have started buying stuff and we know we're having a little boy.My parents and sisters originally told me when they heard I was having a boy that I should name him George after my great-grandfather. I told them we weren't looking for name suggestions and asked them not to push the issue. Then they asked what the name we were thinking of was and I said we weren't going to share until he's here. That wasn't taken well and they decided we must have an awful name lined up and they made a list of suggestions for us with names such as Simon, Malcom, Edward, Fredrick, James, Jonathan and Desmond. I told them again that we did not want or need names suggested because we had our own ideas.I ignored them the next couple of times they mentioned names. But then Christmas Day they had a field day because my oldest sister grabbed my phone while I was in the bathroom and she searched for the list I had on there. We were at my oldest brother's house btw. She showed mom and my other sisters and she tried to involve my brothers but my oldest brother told them they could leave if they started shit at his house in front of his family. But they did start shit and asked me what the hell I was thinking and demanding that I choose one of their names.The names that set them off were Sloan and Finley. They were the two I had on a list on my phone. My brother did have to kick them out in the end because they said I could not ruin my son with a name like that and then said my boyfriend was a bad influence because he wants another dumb name like Jaxon. I told them I was just as much a part of the naming of mine and my boyfriend's baby and just because the names aren't to their taste doesn't mean they have the right to insult us.I had to block them on my phone since Christmas because they were going crazy blowing up my phone. But then I got an email with an even longer list of names two days ago. So I unblocked them temporarily and in a family group chat told them that this is my baby and I do not need or want them to name him for me and I will not entertain a single name on their list and because they have annoyed me, I will never use one of those names ever. I blocked them again and my brothers showed me screenshots of where they are going off. They find it funny but I know they had to mute the chat.

This was all happening just before Christmas which is shitty.I spoke with her again and was firm, she let me know that she understood and he would be leaving for a week before coming back for a short time and then leaving again. I thought this would be ok, but he never ended up leaving and suddenly it was Christmas Eve and she was cooking the three of us a Christmas dinner while I was at work. I felt awful because I was still mad and annoyed that she once again seemed to lie to me and yet I couldn’t be angry that he was still there because it was Christmas and she was cooking a dinner. I didn’t want to participate and accept those nice gestures when I felt like it was all fake… My coworker convinced me I had to say something. I felt horrible, but she convinced me and although I probably ruined my flat mates Christmas, I think it needed to be said. I let her know that I was sorry but he never left and since she didn’t stick to what she said I would now be leaving. She cancelled the dinner and wouldn’t speak to me when I got home and later told me that she asked him to stay because she didn’t want to be alone.She was upset that no one considered her feelings and that she was distress because she couldn’t please both of us. She would rather I speak with him directly instead of using her as a middle man… I was confused and asked if I had a guest she had a problem with, would it be her responsibility to kick them out?I’ve been venting to my best friend about everything that has happened and in hindsight that was an awful mistake as she is friends with my flat mate, but she’s recently decided she doesn’t want to be friends with this person anymore if that is how they treat people. Which is all my fault and I’ve tried to convince her otherwise but she won’t budge.I didn’t want to move out. I enjoyed living with this person.

It’s a nice apartment, 3 bedrooms, in an area convenient for work, transport, and socialising.When Ben and I started discussing living together, I said I didn’t want to move. I love rent free, in a very desirable area, with far more space than the two of us would be able to afford if we rented ourselves. Ben agreed, and was happy to move into my place since he lives much further out from the city centre where transport isn’t as good.When we told my dad we’d like Ben to move in, my dad said that was fine, he’d be happy for Ben to pay the same rent he pays now when he moves in (this is, monetarily, an incredible deal, as Ben’s current rent is about 1/5th of what my apartment would be worth on the rental market). Ben was really surprised and said we’d talk more about it.Basically, Ben thinks if he moves in with me he shouldn’t have to pay rent because I’m not. I said it’s not the same because it’s my dad, he wouldn’t take money from me. I pointed out to Ben he would be moving to a better area, bigger place, not having to pay bills, essentially for free, but he still said he’s not okay with being the only one of us paying rent, and wants to find another place.I think this is an extremely petty reason to want to find a new place. If my place was inconvenient for him work-wise, or the price was extortionate, or he wanted to buy a place, literally any logical reason I would compromise. But this just seems like he’s playing a game of tit for tat. His rent would be the same, I don’t see why it matters to him whether I’m paying rent or not, and I don’t want to move.AITA?",

We occasionally have sleepovers at each other's houses, and I'm the only one who's yet to host one. Here's the thing: I live in a council house (basically a house we don't have to pay for) in a very lower class neighbourhood full of crime, burglaries, robberies, fights, etc. My friends know that I'm poor but they'd never treated me differently for it until now.We planned to stay at my place for the weekend, and we went straight to my home after school. On the way, one of my friends kept making remarks about how \"intimidating\" the people were in my area and the others just agreed, including calling this homeless man who came up to us asking for money \"creepy\" and \"perverted\". This group of teenagers started randomly harassing and yelling stuff at us, trying to start an argument, and when they left my friends called them \"trashy\" and \"chavs\" (a derogatory term for lower class people). Previously I'd opened up to them about how hard it was to live here and how our house had been vandalised before and how we had to hide valuables incase of a break-in. I live in a small two bedroom flat on the first floor. My bedroom is only a box room that's small enough for my bed to fit exactly at one end, I sleep on a mattress on the floor, and the only other furniture I had was a box for storage and when my friends saw this they kept giving fake, sarcastic compliments about how \"cozy\" and \"tiny\" it was.After about an hour, one of my friends called her parents to pick her up and made some excuse about how she suddenly remembered that she had a family thing planned, which I initially believed. Then, soon after, another friend also said she had to leave as she was feeling sick. At this point I got suspicious and they eventually revealed that they felt \"unsafe\" staying over in my neighbourhood and wanted to leave. One friend said my house felt dangerous since my mum was working a shift that afternoon and wouldn't come home until midnight, and my friend was scared someone might break in, which was so irrational because I'd lived here my whole life and I was fine. She was the richest of us and lived in a huge house and had no idea what it's like to not be privileged. She had an awful experience in a poor neighbourhood a few years ago so I get what she was feeling, but we were literally staying inside so there's no reason for her to overreact.I told her she was being overdramatic, yet the rest and my friends all agreed with her saying she was justified in feeling unsafe. I couldn't stand how they made me feel alienated for being poor and how they couldn't even walk in my shoes for one weekend. In the heat of the moment I said my friends were all spoiled brats, and we ended up in a huge argument and they ended up cancelling the sleepover. AITA?",

I'm trying to time it, so he's not here or can't be here when all of this goes down.Hi everyone, it’s been a while. I really want to thank all of you for your perspectives and advice. Just wanted to give an updateRegarding Thanksgiving dinner, when my dad and Nicole arrived, I asked if I could speak with them both. My dad said he didn’t want to talk and went into the living room. Nicole still remained by the front door, so I apologized for insulting her. She replied that she needed to leave and went to the living room. Overall, she still seemed rightfully angry with me. Dinner was awkward because my grandma would try to get my dad and I to talk, but he wouldn’t really bother. After dinner, I pulled him aside and apologized again. He ignored me and went straight to Nicole. I still wasn’t sure if I was heading back with him or not, so I packed everything just in case. When he was getting ready to leave, I asked him if I could come back home. He said Nicole wasn’t comfortable having me home even though it had been a few days since the incident. I spent the entire night crying on the phone with my sister.Therapy and Living Situation: After having my call with my maternal grandpa, he called my paternal grandparents a couple days later to discuss my situation. I overheard the call between them. My maternal grandpa expressed he was concerned about me, especially my mental state and asked my paternal grandparents if they were willing to talk to my dad about putting me in therapy. My grandparents said they’d be willing to take me to their church’s mental support group or talk with their faith leader who specializes in grief counseling. My grandpa pushed back on the idea and mentioned a need for more professional help, but they were not receptive to the idea. All three of them also had a heated conversation about my living arrangement. My grandpa said it was ridiculous for a grown man to throw out their daughter, and it was shameful that my paternal grandparents are not hard-pressed in helping me get back home. That’s all I heard regarding the conversation.Now, my grandma started taking me to weekly private sessions with the faith leader. I’m not entirely happy with the arrangement, but it has helped me start to process my grief in a healthier way. Also, I am still living with my grandparents. I apologized over and over through text to my dad and through my grandparents, but he has not responded. My maternal grandpa has called my dad many times, but my dad blocked him. I am contemplating telling my school counselor next semester all the details regarding my dad and not omitting anything to protect him. I also wasn’t invited to my dad and Nicole’s Christmas dinner which hurt, but I’m starting to not care to have a relationship with my dad. I don’t know if my feelings will change. In a twisted way, it was good he didn’t let me go back home with him. The space has helped me focus on myself.",

So an additional 3 people. I let her know I had told them they were invited.Katie said she didn’t want them there because the activities wouldn’t be appropriate. So I said that’s okay and we can find something else to do and that if anyone paid any deposits or any cancellation fees I’d give her the money spent back.After some arguing Katie said I’m taking all her work for granted and that she was done. I wasn’t sure if she said that out of anger (that would be typical for her) or not so I called one of my future sister in laws, Jess, and just needed to vent. Jess said she’d come over and we’d figure it out. Jess called my other future sister in law, Ashley, and they came over with my mother in law and we planned a whole new bachelorette party in a couple hours. (I’m actually really excited for it.)They really saved the day. I had a conversation with my fiance and asked if he’d think it was weird if I asked them both to be my maid of honors instead. They were both already going to be bridesmaids and their husbands are my fiancés best men. My fiance said he thinks they’d really love that and it would help us bond more. So the next day I officially asked them both at family dinner in front of my in laws, fiance, his brothers, and some extended family. We all cried and none of us have sisters so we all joked about how we finally had them.My future sister in laws posted pictures to social media and captioned it “All the (insert last name) girls. We can’t wait to spend this special day with our newest sister.”Katie saw this and flipped out on me about how I’m just replacing her and how I don’t even care about her feelings. She said I’m throwing away our friendship over girls who haven’t been there for me my whole life. And how could I just replace her role on the most important day of my life within 24 hours. Katie even commented on the post saying “the betrayal”.Katie is making me feel like such an AH. My fiance thinks Katie is overreacting and for me not to worry about it. I just want someone’s opinion who unbiased. AITA?Update:I had a conversation with my husband and we’ve read most of the comments. He agrees that under no circumstances would we tell my sister in laws that they wouldn’t be the maid of honors anymore. They’ve been nothing but wonderful, supportive, and helpful. And we also took into the consideration that maybe Katie and I are just drifting apart and growing differently.I did call Katie and tell her that I love her, appreciate her, and want nothing but the best for her always but that I am going to keep my sister in laws as my maid of honor and that I want her to be my bridesmaid more than anything but I understand if she doesn’t want to be.Katie said she still wants to be a bridesmaid but she’s hurt and feels like I’ll replace her with them. We talked and I don’t know where our friendship will end up but it seems like right now we’re okay.",

I put the word marriage in quotes because I found out after the fact that there was actually no legal marriage that happened, as his girlfriend apparently didn't believe in legal marriage. They instead had a ?symbolic? marriage to celebrate their commitment to eachother after being together for almost 4 years, but the guests were led to believe that it was a legal marriage. He and his now ex-girlfriend had asked for donations for their honeymoon in lieu of wedding gifts. The 'wedding' happened, and then his girlfriend broke up with him before they even went on their honeymoon. Weeks have now passed, and they never returned any of the guests' donations for their honeymoon fund.  I don't want to rub salt in the wound, and I understand that once a gift is given, it is done; however, this is an unusual circumstance. Am I being an asshole  asking for the money gift back?Edit: Some answers to commenter questions: I donated 200$ as my wedding gift for their honeymoon fund. Yes, there was a wedding party and food was offered (nothing super fancy); though from what I was told, the wedding was paid for by their parents. Many guests, including myself, paid a lot of additional expenses to travel to their wedding to attend (hotel costs, time off of work, gas).",

I told her no for obvious reasons. It ended up with her trying to guilt trip me by saying that she's gonna have to feed her cat less than usual, her grandparents are living paycheck to paycheck and pretty much tried to make it my fault if her cats starve.I also want to say that, I never met this women until this day. What I do know from what she told me is that she's 25 years old, has no job, and lives, and depends on her grandparents to take care of her.I got pissed off because in my mind, I'm not gonna let her put her burden onto me when I have a funeral to prepare. So I told her \"That's not my problem, why don't you just get a job if you need to feed your cats?\".

When we got married, a mutual friend of ours (Adria) gifted us an expensive telescope based on an offhand comment I apparently made about enjoying astronomy (I don't remember making this comment).  This gift wasn't on the registry and is not something we're interested in using.  We don't have much space in our current backyard to set it up, and we're not interested in hauling it along when we move to a bigger house.We've been storing the telescope in our basement, where it's taking up a lot of space.  I suggested to Zayden that we sell the telescope online and use the cash towards a down payment on a house, but Zayden is worried that Adria will see the advertisement for the telescope and be offended that we're selling her gift.  So, when a good friend of mine told me how much she loved astronomy, I offered to sell her the telescope and she happily agreed.After the transaction, I told Zayden about it and he got really upset, saying we should have just kept the telescope.  My response was that since it was a private sale and not advertised online where Adria could see, then there wasn't a problem.  My husband said that Adria had been randomly asking him about whether we're using the telescope, and he told her I sold it because I didn't like it.Now Adria is upset that I sold her \"thoughtful gift\", and Zayden is calling me an AH for upsetting Adria when we could've just kept storing the telescope in our basement.  I don't think I did anything wrong, especially since Zayden told me he didn't want the telescope, either.  AITA?EDIT: I realize that I forgot to mention this in my original post.

	"body" : "My cousin \"Tammy\" is 34 and has always had a desire to be the center of attention. Given this, I'm not sure why I was expecting anything different but given the circumstances I would have figured she would tone it down. Her sister (not blood relation to me because they have different dads) is 22 and she just gave birth to her son, whom was unfortunately born still. It was very unexpected. There were no pregnancy complications and everything was going perfectly but during her last scan, his heart simply stopped while they were in the middle of the ultrasound. She gave birth 3 days later, after being induced. As a mom myself, I cannot imagine the pain and suffering. Her going a full 3 days, knowing her baby was gone, before she was able to birth him is so heartbreaking.Now.. when she actually went in to labor she struggled immensely. Mentally she was not in it, which was making the process harder I'm sure. At some point the doctor asked my cousin to hold her sister's leg back to help the process. Since then, my cousin has been over the top trying to steal her sister's pain. Posting on Facebook that it was the worst day of her life and how she is so heartbroken. Posting pictures to her Instagram with her and the deceased baby with captions saying \"my loss of you will never be forgotten. I miss you already my beautiful boy\". It's to a point where people are asking her when SHE got pregnant, thinking the baby is hers, and those are the only people she doesn't respond to so she never clarifies to anyone that this is actually not her baby at all. She does however respond to everyone saying \"omg I'm so sorry for your loss\". I DO understand she has grief. That's not even a question. But she's riding her sister's pain and depriving her sister the resources she needs to heal.Well, I offered to make her sister dinner and bring it over to her and her sister asked if she could come to my place because being near her son's nursery was too hard. I of course said yes. She got a ride from my cousin. They invited over a few other family members of theirs (totally fine). Every single time anyone hugged this girl or told her how sorry they were, etc, my cousin would start the water works. \"How do you think I feel? I delivered my nephew dead. I'm not okay\". Eventually I was beyond fed up and pulled her aside and told her to stop hijacking her sisters pain and that this isn't about her. I told her to stop claiming she delivered that boy because she didn't. She held her sisters leg, which is common. I told her she was being selfish as fuck and if she didn't stop, she could leave because she's sickening me. I also told her that I understand she's in pain too but that does not compare to her sisters pain at all. She ended up leaving immediately after that, stating that I'm an \"ignorant piece of work\" to think she's not feeling this pain as deeply as her sister is and that she \"hopes I never know this pain\" (I do know this pain, I watched my mom go through it when I was 16 but it was my mom's pain, not mine).

She’s always dreamed of becoming a mom and I’m super hyped to become an aunt again. The only thing is the name she and her boyfriend have picked out.Both my sister and her fiancé had previously decided to keep their daughter’s name private, but they recently decided it was time to share the name with both my family and his family. So, my sister recently shared the name with us in our family group chat, and they want to name their daughter:Araya Sunshine Heavenly Olivia [last name].At first I thought she was joking, and she informed me that she was being completely serious, and that the two of them have had their hearts set on this name ever since they found out they were having a girl. I told her that she could name her baby whatever she wanted, but she should consider that she’s not just naming a baby, she’s naming a human being that will eventually become an adult, and that I think the name would be quite a weird name for an adult to have. Her response was “If you don’t like the name, don’t name your kid that!” then proceeded to tell me that her chosen name was much better than the “basic, boring, grandma names” that I named my daughters.She then told me I was an asshole for criticizing her baby name, but I think I’m trying to save her future child from a lifetime of bullying and jokes over her name.I don’t have a terrible name, but my name is a traditionally male name, and I was constantly getting teased in my school years for having a “boy name”.

I've bounced around from one family to another since then. I was almost adopted once, but that fell through and I was moved again. I've been out of the system and on my own for a few years now.

Dana is my assistant supervisor and Jane is the same position as me. This all happened yesterday.I would sometimes order ubereats for lunch because I don't drive. Dana has been asking me questions about ubereats here and there and I don't usually think anything of it, but she'll also make remarks like \"so when you gonna buy me lunch,\" or \"are you ordering lunch today,\" which I brushed off as a joke but when she kept doing it I would just always say no.Now every payday, as a group we would get a work lunch all together, but as yesterday was not a payday, I just ordered for myself, which I didn't think anything of until Jane came over and said \"oh you ordered lunch, why didn't you tell us?\"I honestly didn't know what to respond, but before I could Dana said \"he's always doing that man,\" and then Jane said \"it would be nice if you announced to the group that you're ordering lunch,\"I just got annoyed, and as I had told Jane about ubereats too, I just said to them bluntly \"well then you can just download the app yourselves and order it,\" which Jane cut me off and said \"no we don't need your money, but it would be nice if you would tell us so we can give you money to order for us,\" to which Dana chimed in \"thank you.\"Before I could say anything else, Jane said that she had her issue with me and not to get into it with her, so I just didn't say anything else.

Thank you to everyone that left a comment, you all have given me new perspectives to look at this.I wanted to add some info to this as I have seen some questions pop up multiple times:I am the only one that does Ubereats/doordash as I currently do not drive (don't have a liscense but I'm working on getting it) everyone else drives, so they don't really have a need to do ubereats/doordash.Other then Dana making the comments like I mentioned above when it came to me ordering, nobody else had made a comment regarding me ordering other than asking what I ordered prior to yesterday, so it's why I came here thinking I did something wrong or was acting selfish.I work with mostly Haitian, Hispanic, Jamacian, and Phillipino women staff-wise. I'm not sure if this gives anyone an idea of how my work environment could be as the only way I would personally say that it depends on the day and how everyone is feeling.I don't ask when using ubereats/doordash, but there are times outside of payday that we order lunch and that is usually when we are traveling off-site, and in those instances we do ask around depending on who the driver/monitor is that is going to pick it up (usually I am the monitor while the driver is different)I have not offered before to buy anyone lunch when I use ubereats/doordash, and when Dana would make a comment or ask  I would usually either turn her down or tell her that either I'm not ordering or I don't know if I'm ordering, but personally with her comments to me I usually don't want to order her lunch.Dana is the only person that does this, everyone else (including Dans) will either have their own lunch brought, have family stop buy to bring them lunch, or would share lunch among each other (yes they have shared lunch with me in the past if I didn't eat lunch or didn't order anything for lunch, but this was before Dana had joined our team. Dana will offer part of her lunch she won't eat due to her dietary habits when we order out or if she wants me to try her cooking)I'm trying to be as unbiased in my typing as this is my 2nd full time job ever and I don't pick up on social cues well, so please let me know if you have anymore questions",

However, Gordon didn't want to attend. This upset Ryan as he wanted his brother present for the celebration. Despite our efforts to persuade Gordon, he insisted on not attending, claiming he didn't want to go to Dave and Busters. In attempt to avoid any conflict with Gordon, I allowed him to stay home, with the condition that he remain in the house and answer our calls when we check on him.

He said that American size differed from Japanese size and that an L would look huge and baggy on me, but I told him that I wanted an over size and baggy hoodie, because I don’t have one of those. Besides, it’s really cold where I live so with a baggy hoodie I could wear layers without having to wear parka.

I have had Dixie since she was born and have spent the last two years raising her to be my service dog, spending thousands of dollars and countless hours. Over the holidays, I brought Dixie with me to see family. My aunt (51f) loves dogs and Dixie is super sweet, so my aunt was glued to her. On the third day of visiting, my aunt asked to take Dixie for a walk. I was fine with it, but I couldn't go with them because I was helping in the kitchen. So my aunt and Dixie go on their walk and I continue with my work. I was also grateful that someone else was willing to take her because Dixie is a high-energy dog (Australian shepherd) and only gets tired after about three miles.Something to know about Dixie is that ever since she was a puppy, she has had a habit of holding things in her mouth when she is excited. Generally, this is one of her toys, but if she doesn't have a toy around, she'll grab whatever is closest. I know this is a habit of hers, so when we go outside, she always brings her raccoon when she is off duty. She did on this walk as well. However, my aunt took it away from her as they were leaving and left it by the front door. I don't see this aunt very often, but I did tell her that Dixie takes the raccoon everywhere.On their walk, Dixie picked up a sizeable rock to hold in her mouth. My aunt tried to take this away as well, and Dixie resisted. In trying to keep the rock, she accidentally swallowed it. My aunt came back right away, and I took Dixie to the nearest emergency vet, over three hours away. (It was past 8 pm at this point and all the vets in between were closed for the night.) Dixie ended up needing surgery to remove the rock and repair the damage to her throat, but she is expected to recover well.As I was waiting, I called my family to tell them that Dixie was in surgery. My family all expressed their sympathy and my aunt apologized for letting this happen. Once I was done on the phone, I texted my aunt asking for her to pay the vet bill, which ended up coming to almost $2000. She called me an AH for asking her and not accepting her apology. While I do accept her apology, and I know accidents happen, this is a big expense that is more of a burden on me than her. My aunt is a multimillionaire who just spent ten times that on a lavish tropical vacation. As a college student, this would wipe out my savings and I need the money to pay my tuition for the upcoming semester. She is now downstairs complaining about my entitlement to my entire family, and most of them agree with her. So, AITA?EDIT: We were all at my mom's brother's house, who is also my aunt's brother.

I told him at least five times that this was a bad idea and why, but he was adamant he needed to accept the invitation.He went, and ended up losing a lot of money, enough that he won’t be able to make his half of the rent this month (we live together). Most of that money, he lost to Max (Max plays A LOT of poker and took pretty much everyone’s money). Sam is obviously upset, and explained himself by saying he just got caught up in not looking like a loser, and wanting to fit in. I said that’s okay, but you need to go and ask for the money back. Sam said he couldn’t. I said he definitely could, Max will give it to him no questions asked. Sam said he wasn’t going to humiliate himself by asking my ex for money back. I said that’s fine but how are you planning to pay the rent? He said he was hoping I would cover it for this month. I said there is absolutely no way I would be paying for his irresponsible decisions, especially after I gave him every opportunity to not be in this situation. Sam said that was very cold and the money would make no difference to me but for him it’s the difference between looking like trash to my family and friends (he is sure him asking for the money back would get around).I can’t ask my family for opinions on whether I’m the AH for saying no because I know they would go nuts if they knew he was essentially asking me for money. So I just need some people who aren’t invested to share an opinion.Edit: to people who pointed out the rent needs to be paid - obviously if push comes to shove I will pay it, but right now if he puts me in that position I don’t really know if the relationship will be sustainable. That’s why I need a judgement on whether I’m being unreasonable",

	"body" : "My (27m) wife(25f) and i had a baby 3 weeks or so ago. It's been challenging as newborns are but little fella is healthy and growing up. For context, i moved to her house when baby was born(she lives with her mother (MIL) and her Grandma (GMIL)), they've treated me like another one of the family.Baby was particular fussy this night, so wife couldn't sleep well. I swear she transforms into Godzilla when she's sleepy. At 7am she sends me a text asking me to take baby so she can rest a bit ( we sleep in separate rooms, because reasons i guess, her decision, I'm guessing she feels more comfortable sleeping next to her mom and grandma).  I take him and proceed to try and calm him down, he seems hungry, i text my wife to tell her so and she tells me that he's already feed and he's only making a fuss. I say okay and then try again to calm little fella down. Everything seems to be going well when 20 minutes in wife texts me telling me to take baby to the kitchen and get a fire going in the fireplace. I reason why bother, given that she said she was going to sleep and the baby seems relaxed, warm and is falling asleep while i caress his cheek. Another 20 minutes go by and my wife storms into the room yelling. Conversation goes something like this:W: I think i told you to take him to the kitchenMe: Why bother, baby is fine, I don't want to disturb himW: Why won't you let me do things my way, I'm the motherMe: And I'm the father, if you're going to leave him with me trust that i can handle himW: Being a father is easy, it's me who has to wake up every time to feed himMe: that was your decision, since you refuse to fill with formula or extract so i can bottle feed him.She then lunges to try and take the baby from me. Almost crying and looking very angry. I refuse to give him to her and say.Me: sit down next to me, please, breathe and calm downW: no, I'm taking him to the kitchen.Me: I'm not giving him to you if you're being like this. I understand you're tired and want to sleep, but that does not excuse treating me like a punching bag and taking things out on me.W: stop making things harder for me.Then MIL came in to take baby away to the kitchen (she didn't say anything, she probably heard us) and wife storms off to her room.I honestly think i might have handled it poorly, I'm really trying to be understanding, having a baby is hard on everyone, especially the mother. But i don't want to have her backseat parenting and i don't want to make it a habit for her to treat me like crap, I'm firm on setting reasonable boundaries. I always try to compromise and most of the times i yield to what she wants. But i feel that if u don't stand my ground on some things my existence is going to be miserable, but i think i could have given in this one to spare us unnecessary stressSo, AITA?",

	"body" : "Approximately once or twice a week, after dinner and a bit of tv together my (f,29) husband (m,32) asks if I will go to bed so he can play FIFA in the lounge. I usually do and think it’s important he has a bit of time for himself (This is not his only time for himself). The problem lies in the fact that he stays up super late until 3/4am.He has to be up at 5am for work and we have a baby and toddler so our sleep is often broken. My husband is always complaining about being tired and it affects him in the daytime.To encourage him to sleep at a reasonable time I ask what time he will come to bed. He will always agree to a midnight/ 1am bedtime which is always at least an hour and a half of gaming. He always breaks this and is much later.I know I am not his mother or in charge of him but it more than bothers me that he doesn’t keep his agreement. He’s making himself more tired and complaining about it. It’s irritating that his words mean nothing and to me he is consciously lying. This is not a one off accident, nor is he only a little bit late. It’s hours. He says he thought I’d be asleep so wouldn’t notice but him coming upstairs wakes me up.The most hurtful thing is that I was married before and my first husband died in a car accident on his way home from a night shift. I was woken traumatically by police pounding on my door and my worst memory is looking to his side of the bed and him not being there.When I wake in the night (baby/toddler ensure this) and look at the time realising my husband hasn’t come to bed I have the same panicked feeling. He knows this and it really upsets me that his game is more important than my feelings.In my eyes he’s being irresponsible and selfish. He has time to unwind and enjoy gaming but he takes the piss with it. He should be able to stop and come to bed instead of acting like a teenager. He knows how I panic when I wake up and he’s not there when he should be, but does this regularly anyway. AITA for being so upset?",

	"body" : "Over the weekend I called animal control because our neighbor has left their dog outside in freezing weather. This dog has been outside for as long as I know. I've never seen them take it inside their house. The weather here is a high of 0F and a windchill of -20F. The dog has no shelter, not even trees or bushes to block the wind. I think the dog is a shepherd/lab mix. I admit I'm not a dog expert, but it didn't seem like this dog had any business being outside.I didn't talk to the neighbor first because I've heard rumors that he has had run-ins with a few other people in the neighborhood and I didn't want to deal with that. Besides, I figure they know they have a dog and they know it's cold outside. I didn't expect to get anywhere by talking with them. I also was hoping to remain anonymous if I had to report it and talking to them first would have made it obvious that it was me.Animal control came out over the weekend while the neighbor wasn't home. They took the dog and left some paperwork on their door. The next day he came over and asked if I'm the one that called. I didn't really want to admit it but I also didn't want to lie. I told him that I was really worried about the dog and I wanted to make sure it was alright. He started arguing with me and saying I should have talked to him first and blaming me for their kids' pet being taken away. Note, I have never once seen the kids playing with the dog and like I said it is always outside. He was also saying I owe him $400 ($150 fine + $120 for boarding + $100 for medical).Anyway, I figured if animal control came out and there was nothing wrong then they would leave and it wouldn't be an issue. The fact that they took the dog makes me think it was the right thing to do. Maybe I should have talked with them first, but I didn't want to get into it with them. AITA for not talking with my neighbor first?Edit: Thanks for the support everybody. Early replies make it sound like I did the right thing. I knew the dog needed help, but I wasn't sure if I screwed up by not talking to my neighbor first. I was hoping to avoid a confrontation, but I'm not overly worried about it. I told him I wasn't going to pay when he was demanding it. I'm going to stick to it if he asks again. Oh, and as far as I know the dog is okay right now. I don't know whether he will get it back or not.",

	"body" : "My brother (40) and his wife (43) have been trying to get pregnant for 3 years. They’ve done multiple extremely expensive IVF rounds after the ones covered by insurance didn’t pan out.Over the years, I’ve of course been there for them, told them how sorry I was every time it didn’t work, wished them luck, sent cards and brought over flowers; everything to try and be a supportive family member.With Christmas, my brother (he wasn’t drunk but he had definitely had some alchohol) asked me in private if I thought it was a good idea they were even trying to have kids, if they should give up, stop trying to find alternatives or wasting money etc. He was really down in the dumps.I know my brother wants to be a father more than anything. I told him I loved him and I was sorry that it wasn’t working out, but that that was a decision only they could make,  and that I understood they were using all their resources to try for kids if this is what they desperately wanted.He kept pushing though and told me that was a generic answer you’re “supposed”  to give and what my personal opinion was. When I reiterated that my opinion didn’t matter and only they could decide on this, he kept pushing, so eventually I said roughly the following (in what I hope was an appropriately sympathetic and loving tone):“I know you really want kids and have always wanted them. You’re sad and emotionally struggling with the fact that that isn’t going as planned. I don’t think the honest answer you’re pushing for is going to be helpful to you or help you process what you’re going through. I love you very much but I think there’s a specific answer you want that I can’t give you.”I just really didn’t want to contribute further to any pain and emotional struggles he might be going through and didn't know what to say.Privately, I don’t think my brother and SIL should be having kids at all, but especially not genetically via natural birth the way they’ve been trying, and they refuse to consider adoption.I also don’t think it’s my business to say that to my brother’s face when I know he desperately wants kids and his timeline/plan for them was already pushed back by almost 10 years. He's hurting and there's no reason for me to add to that.If I thought that saying any (part) of that opinion, in an appropriate tone with the correct words and as nicely as possible, would help my brother process this complicated emotional rollercoaster, I’d talk to him about it. But I know from experience when he pushes for my “true opinion” he usually doesn’t actually want that, and that even if he did, under these circumstances (he’s had alcohol, it was Christmas, we were privately talking for a  bit upstairs but had to go back downstairs to the whole family shebang at some point) it wasn’t the correct thing to do.He’s been very unhappy with me and barely talking to me.

She was abandoned as a baby and nearly died in an orphanage before being adopted and raised by an American family. Aya considers herself American and is firm that due to her traumatic experience with China, she has no desire to “be Chinese” or explore the language and culture.Zach is also Chinese and the son of wealthy business owners. He is very proud of his culture.Background: A few years ago at dinner, Zach took Aya’s fork and knife and told her she needed to eat with chopsticks. I immediately stopped him and made him give her silverware back, wondering wtf that was about.Later, Aya told me Zach had decided she needed to be “more Chinese” and was pressuring her to engage with Chinese language/culture. Zach apologized, Aya let it go.Current situation: Aya asked me and Zach to help plan her wedding. Zach suggested Aya wear a qipao, have red as a wedding color, no white dress, serve Chinese food, etc.I pulled Zach aside and told him Aya has been very clear she does not want a Chinese wedding, stop forcing it. Please just follow what Aya wants. Chinese culture is lovely, but this is not the time or place.Aya was grateful and thanked me for reining Zach in, because she was having a hard time confronting him. Bridal party and most friends agreed.However, Zach and some others are upset, saying Zach has the right to express his culture and make suggestions, Zach feels lonely and there are not a lot of other Chinese people around, Aya IS Chinese so not a big deal.Now, I’m not anti-Chinese. Zach and I actually met in Chinese class and enjoy doing Chinese cultural things together. I am from a different culture myself. I know it’s hard. When Zach marries, I will support him having a Chinese wedding.But Aya has trauma around her Chinese roots and considers herself American. She DOES NOT WANT Chinese traditions. I support Aya in having an American wedding.I refused to apologize, and Zach is more upset. I understand Zach loves his culture but I don’t think he has the right to push it at Aya’s wedding.

And, while we’ve been trying our best to create a harmonious environment, a recent incident has caused some tension.The other day, we had a family gathering at our house, and I took a candid photo of the event. In the background of the picture, my toddler is visible, while his big brother isn’t (not on purpose; I didn’t even realize my toddler was in it himself). I posted the picture on social media without giving it much thought, as it was a sweet moment.However, shortly after posting, my stepson approached me and expressed his hurt feelings. He told me that seeing the picture made him feel excluded and unimportant. He felt like I was intentionally highlighting his brother and neglecting him. I was taken aback by his reaction, and tried to reassure him that it was an innocent oversight/that my love for both my boys is equal, but he remained upset.Now, here’s where I may have messed up: I never took down the post. Those we couldn’t make it to our family event had already commented on/liked it, with my MIL having even reposted it. While I did understand my son’s feelings, I didn’t really see the point in deleting it, since it had already had its own fair share of traction (and, doubly: my son and I had already had our above chat).Apparently, later, my son brought it up to my wife, though, and she—out of curiosity—decided to check my account, which still showcased the image. She (rather understandably, honestly) proceeded to get angry with me, telling me that it wouldn’t have killed me to just delete the post.I did end up taking it down, but my wife still seems to think of me as the AH for not doing it straight after our son brought it up.

What started out as kayla getting angry with me over not wanting my house to be viewed as the party house for her and her friends, then turned into her telling everyone I was cheating on my partner. There has been an ongoing argument between her and I for a little over 3 years now, I had tried to “bury the hatchet” and decided to invite her to my house to celebrate my 25th birthday as well as mine and Tyler’s engagement. During the celebration, Kayla was running her mouth and staying that I was being unfaithful, while asking everyone if they had any drugs, so I had to ask her to leave and an altercation broke out. Cops were called and after that night I decided it was best to cut all contact with her, and haven’t spoken to her since. This past week my, mom had stated that Kayla will be attending my wedding and I have no say in the matter because “blood is blood” and “Kayla is family”. With that being said Tyler and I had collectively agreed that Kayla was not welcome at our wedding and an invitation would not be sent to her prior to the conversation with my mom. Due to all previous issues that Kayla has created I would prefer not to have any additional stress be added to a day that will be stressful enough without her being included.

I get wanting to co-parent, but I do not like them talking about us or her just showing up unannounced whenever she wants. He just says that is how she is and I need to deal. My issue is not her coming over but doing it unannounced. We have 2 young children but they try to make all of the decisions for all of the kids. I’ve been asking to move closer to family for a while because it is hard to raise two young g kids with no help, not even daycare.

Now she is coming back and I was told that she was going to stay with a friend when she returns and was told this since before she left. Now that she is coming back in less than a week, I finally find out she is staying with us indefinitely and has not talked to her friend.

The problem started about 4 months ago when this new girl started working there.

She did not answer me but I thought she heard and me and that she would know for the next time.However, this has happened every single time I have talked with her during pick up, I have reminded her, tried to tell her politely and tried to be more stern in my tone. I have talked with two other workers and they have told me that they would talk to her, however, this has continued. It maybe doesn’t seem like a big problem, but being a young mother my role as her parent is very often disregarded and overlooked. So to me, it becomes a big deal when a person continually does something like this.So started last week, I completely stopped talking to this girl. If she was the one to come up to me during pick up, I would walk right past her and do the pick up with another one of the workers there.Yesterday the principal asked to talk with me during drop off, she asked me if I had anything against this one girl as she had complained about me refusing to talk with her or acknowledge her. She had apparently found this extremely disrespectful and the principal told me that I had to respect all the workers, not just the one I wanted to.I am begging to feel like an asshole because while I found her extremely rude, being disrespected at your workplace is never fun and I disrespected her in a place where she maybe have worked her to land in.",

My mother and I live 30 minutes by car from S.I was doing my last semester of university from September to December 2023. I was working part-time, and volunteered a lot.My mother and I previously babysitted her child before. Three times at her place.I never liked babysitting. Even as a child. The thought of it gives me anxiety. I feel the same until today. Everyone knows this about me.My mother is uncomfortable with babysitting her child given the situation in bullet point 2. She doesn’t enjoy babysitting that much either. I was there with her to babysit because she asked me to. It made her feel more comfortable.Her father and his wife babysit the child regularly. She doesn’t have any friends, except a a mom friend. Her mother and siblings  are in another country. She has no boyfriend. The father is not involved. She had a babysitter before.THE SITUATION: In September 2023, I get a call from S (26F), which she never does. She mentions how she lost her babysitter abruptly, but that she already signed up for the acrobatic class. Her dad’s wife will help a bit. She didn’t ask to babysit explicitly. The call ended.She then calls again saying how she was in the neighbourhood and if she can come. Then, she mentions that again in front of my mother. We entertained her child a bit and they left.She messaged me, asking if we can babysit officially (she was hoping that we would offer). She mentioned that it’s only 2 hours. We live far apart and she would need to drive back and forth. The class is 1 hour. We need a cushion for the child since he has separation anxiety. More buffer room as well. This is a good 4-5 hour ordeal. She said that he will sleep, but He won’t sleep. She reinforced that u could homework during. This is indefinitely as well.I said no, I will not because of reason #5 & #7. My mother said she can but only once every 2 months. Her reasoning is mostly reinforced by #2 & #8. I told her to figure out other arrangements or seek a new babysitterMy response above angered her. she responded with “Okay, you know what, just forget about it. I didn't realize that this was such an issue for you... I think I'm just confused because I thought we are pretty much like family with especially with the things you guys have said to me. I get that it maybe it's an inconvenience for you to babysit but the only reason I asked you is because I actually consider you like family, and I want Child (2M) to have family around.

Her exam schedule was messed up because of the pandemic and therefore, we tried to find a date as far out as possible to avoid a potential conflict.Now, we just found out that her exam might be around those dates (not same day because weekend wedding but might be on Friday or Monday). She wants us to change our wedding date even though the venue is booked with the initial deposit payment.So we decided to reschedule to mid-November for her benefit. Given that she already knows the tentative dates for her exam, she has this entire year to study and prepare barring our wedding weekend and a couple more days for shopping/ pre-wedding stuff around that weekend. Also, she will have 2 weeks after our wedding to revise and get in the groove to give her exams.She's still unhappy about the new wedding date and claiming that we don't consider her and her exam important enough and don't want her to attend our wedding since we're not scheduling for after her exams. She claims that 2 weeks is not enough time for her to study and will make her perform poorly. She wants us to move the wedding to January instead. She directly targeted me and told her mom and aunts that I don't consider her exams important.Her mom (FMIL) is now claiming that we can get married whenever we want and FMIL and FSIL will not attend.I'm furious with this attitude. This is a girl who has continuously tried to make me get my wedding outfit and my entire wedding theme, food, etc. according to her tastes (we have VERY different styles and tastes), increasing my guest list to include almost 10 of her friends and other such things.Not to mention, she is planning to get married end of 2025 and doesn't want to share her wedding  MONTH with any of her cousins - ie, if her cousin wants to get married in November 2025, she won't marry in the same month.FMIL says I need to learn to compromise and to give in because that's what you do when you join a new family and that none of this is FSIL's fault and that education is more important than weddings.My boyfriend and I have had to jump through a lot of hoops with our families and come a long way from fighting with each other like children and have finally learned to live as a happy couple.So we're both on the same page and are frustrated with this new problem cropping up.AITA if I tell her to stop acting so entitled and making my wedding about her?EDIT: We can't pick a date before November 15th or between December 16th - January 15th due to religious reasons (same religion for both families). Our original date was in the 2nd week of December. While postponing one more month is technically not a big deal, it's about principle... we're just so tired of waiting.EDIT 2: Our parents are each contributing 50% to the wedding cost. It's in our home country where SIL resides. We will be the ones flying home. The wedding is in the same country as SIL just a different city. And I have to add, regardless of my SIL, MIL up until this point has been the pinnacle of grace and kindness and has been pretty nice to me.",

Every time we attend these events, her family members can't help but comment on my clothing choices. I mean, seriously, I dress pretty casually, but it's not like I'm wearing burlap sacks.At first, I brushed it off, thinking it was harmless banter. But it's become a pattern, and their comments have started to bother me. They make jokes or snide remarks about my style, saying things like, \"Oh, still wearing those emo jeans?\" or \"Why don't you try dressing up for once?\"I've tried different approaches—ignoring the comments, laughing them off, or even attempting to address it politely. But nothing seems to work. I've spoken to my wife about how uncomfortable this makes me feel, but she just thinks her family is being playful and doesn't see it as a big deal.Now, I've reached a point where I refuse to attend anything with her family. Most recently their yearly new years eve party (their family tradition). I don't want to subject myself to their constant remarks about something as stupid as clothing. But my wife thinks I'm overreacting and causing unnecessary drama by avoiding her family.

	"body" : "My son was born while I was still a high school student. I wasn’t ready to be a parent, and instead put him up for an open adoption. The little family that adopted him would send me birthday and holiday cards and such, but that was as much as I was involved. I was terrified. The baby was diagnosed with some issue with the nerve in his eye and was blind from it. I felt like I did something wrong, or I had caused it. I also felt so relieved I got to move on and live my life, I went to college, I built a career, all the while feeling this immense relief when this family would write me to tell me about his first braille typewriter or whatnot that I wasn’t having to deal with this… and then I’ve always felt guilty for being relieved.I’m now married, and I have two daughters (32F and 28F) with my husband. They have always known I had another child who was adopted. My daughters have also always been interested in fostering this connection. I’ve always suggested we leave him alone to live his life. Without my knowing, my oldest sought him out on FaceBook of all places. Though her she has brought him in to be involved with the family the past few years. While they may have had an instant connection, I feel embarrassed to say I just haven’t. I’m happy to know that he’s doing well in life, he’s getting married this spring and he has a doctoral degree in physics. It’s all very nice to be proud of but it’s like learning about a stranger, I certainly don’t feel like his mother.This thanksgiving we hosted. All three of my children were present. My son follows a guide dog to get around, but often when he is over he takes off the harness and lets the dog play with the other family dogs. That day was much the same. I gave the dogs some scraps to eat and didn’t think anything more of it. Several days later it turns out his dog was at the emergency vet hospital and had some issues with maybe its pancreas and also a possible bone trapped in its intestine. They decided to take the dog to surgery to search for it and have it removed. My daughter immediately asked if I had given the dogs anything and was furious with me over giving them some table scraps. She is adamant I caused this issue and I shouldn be offering to pay.I did reach out to my son to offer to pay. He said that was kind but he had it covered. I told him I didn’t want him to worry financially because I know it can be hard for him to keep employment given his condition. All he said was he has pet health insurance so after deductible he only pays 10% and he has completely capable of paying for it. We left it at that. My daughter is still now refusing to bring her dogs to my home, calling me irresponsible. She is blaming me and feels I “never take responsibility” for the “harm” I cause, but I cannot pay if her refuses to take my money.",

She decorates and cooks perfectly according to her theme, begs no one else to contribute, and if you don’t have food allergies it feels like a true privilege to attend. I unfortunately am allergic to most shellfish, but this has never been an issue before as there have always been many options at her events.  This year she offered to host for Christmas Eve and wanted to do the feast of the seven fishes. She knows about my allergy and I know it’s not the easiest theme to work around that, so I asked what I could do to help or if I could just bring a few dishes I can definitely eat. She said all was handled, please don’t bring off-theme dishes, she had me covered.We didn’t eat anything before we went to her house because typically if you do, you regret not having more room for what she’s made. This time, the only thing I could eat without a reaction was a (delicious) dip that was part of the first course. The rest of the night I got to watch everyone else enjoy the delicious meals while I helped put together a Lego set with bf’s niece. BF did at one point offer to order pizza delivery, which I declined because it felt rude to his sister and honestly a bit embarrassing for me. On the way out she apologized and said it was an oversight and offered to make dinner soon to make it up to us. I accepted her apology but declined the dinner and my tone was probably cold. On the way home I told my bf I felt disrespected and won’t attend events she hosts anymore, as it’s clear she won’t take my dietary needs into account on top of being inflexible. He’s pissed because this is going to cause “unnecessary” drama in his family and he feels it won’t happen again.Tl;dr: AITA if I don’t want to attend food-centric events anymore if they’re hosted my bf’s sister after she refused make dishes I could eat or allow me to bring my own food?",

	"body" : "I feel like a POS, no question there. But anyways, my step daughter is 12. Her name is Hannah and she is a beautiful, brilliant girl. The only issue I have is that she respects zero boundaries. I have half a mind to say she acts slightly entitled (ie: if you tell her no, it's met with a \"actually you're going to say yes because I'm a princess\" and she laughs when she says it so I think she's joking but she's actually serious. When she realizes you won't budge, she stomps off to her room and rolls her eyes at you and gives you the silent treatment). Other than this, she's a gem.Well, a little over two weeks ago a lot of my state flooded (Maine, if you're interested). The first floor of our home was filled with water, as we were right beside the river. Everything upstairs was untouched but everything downstairs (living room, nursery, my bedroom, kitchen) was destroyed. By the time we were able to go see our home, the amount of black mold already growing was ridiculous. My step daughters room was upstairs so she didn't lose anything. My husband and I had to start from scratch on all of our clothing and our 3 month old daughters clothing. And given that we were just blowing so much money on a hotel, we were more broke than we ever had been. We reached out to local churches and thankfully we were given a small bag of clothes and diaper help for our daughter but my husband and I have been hand washing the 2 sets of clothes we have for ourselves. Insurance hasn't kicked in yet but we did finally get a voucher provided by the state for our hotel stay and food so we are slowly starting to get better financially.Well, ever since we got that small bag of clothes from the church (4 outfits and 2 onesies) my step daughter has been taking those clothes and putting them on her dolls/stuffed animals despite us telling her to stop. And then today (after literally 8-10 discussions) I found that she had actually cut up one of the onesies to fit her teddy bear better. I lost it. I told her she was selfish and inconsiderate. That she didn't take the time to listen to her father and I or our reasoning and that she's knowingly destroying her sisters needed items for her own gain. She immediately started crying and slammed the door. I DID apologize. Absolutely. She's a fucking kid and I just lost my shit out of anger. But I told my husband because I felt like a POS and he said he will never forgive me. He told me to go stay with my mom for awhile (out of state) while he figures stuff out for him and his daughter because I'm \"unsafe\" to be around. AITA?ETA: the events in my post are 100% what happened. There's no other hidden happenings. I think this was 100% a stress induced outburst on his part because he lost everything in the flood (his brothers urn, his mom's paintings, his guitars, gaming consoles, $8k+ in electronics, etc) but I didn't have much to lose outside of clothing and my drawings. He had just yelled at her 3 days prior for taking the babies diapers and using them on her dolls, so he's by no means perfect and should have understood my frustrations but he says he's allowed to lash out, I'm not. He said it makes him not trust me around his kid. But no, nothing else happened. He wouldn't have even known if I hadn't told him because my step daughter had forgotten all about it by the time he had gotten home and her and I were watching TV together. Again, I did apologize to her before I even told her dad what happened.",

However, a week ago, we were at an event and my gf saw a reminder of my phone for the upcoming concert and she said that she had a performance showcase coming up (she does the performing arts) and turns out that it is taking place on the exact same Wednesday night next week. i was made aware of the showcase in question at the beginning of this year, however the specific date was never really mentioned until the notif. my concert goes from 8pm-12am and her showcase has 2 events with the times ranging from 8-9pm and 9-10pmi asked yesterday what was going on next wednesday for clarification. she asked if i would be able to ditch my concert to attend her showcase which i outright refused since i thought it was unfair for me to flake on an event which i had booked prior to finding out about her showcase.  then she asked if i would be able to at least come late to the concert to attend the 8-9pm event  so i can at least see her performing on stage, which i refused. she got upset about it and compared it to an infant child in school performing and being sad because they can't see their parents in the crowd and how i was the mean parent not being there for their child. at the event im going to partake in recreational drugs which is preventing me from driving; IF i had my car it would be alot easier to drive to the venue after her showcase which wouldve made it viablenow she is claiming that i am ditching her to do drugs and that if i really supported her i would at least try to compromise by coming to this concert a few hours later.  to be clear; i understand just how important performing arts is to my girlfriend and i am extremely supportive of all of her endeavours and love her very dearly HOWEVER I have been looking forward to this concert for a very long time and transportation arrangements have already been made; everything would be knocked out of wack and i would be very stressed attempting to get to the venue in time. so now i feel like im at an ultimatum; choose my gf or this concertmy girlfriend is extremely upset and i feel terrible because i wont be able to support her on her big night. she insists that this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience and that my concert would always be available next year and the year after that etc. i think that we are both at fault for communication issues; i should've asked for the date of her showcase much earlier and she should've told me much earlier to keep the day freei feel terrible for not being able to support my girlfriend on her special day but at the same time its not my fault that she made me aware of this showcase until recentlyAITA for not compromising my concert plans to attend my girlfriend's showcase?",

The first time they formally met in person, he came over at midnight with a duffel bag and has not left for a week. Every day was a different excuse for why he couldn’t leave, like it being too late to go or there being a storm (there was not), and he has been fully moved in with us (me, Amy, and our third housemate, also 21F) since Day 3.Some quick background: Amy and her ex broke up 2 months ago. She says that she wasn’t sure if she was ready for a new relationship but has fallen for Rob. All 3 housemates are uni students, and we’re renting as 3 people (as defined in our lease).Timeline:Day 1: Rob comes over at 12am with a duffel bag and a 6-pack of beers. Amy claims he had no intention of sleeping over this first night. They talk until 6am in the living room. He doesn’t want to leave because “it’s really late,” so Amy tells him to sleep on the couch. He agrees but then asks to see something in her room that they’d discussed earlier. They go upstairs, and he falls “asleep,” so they spend the night together in her room. He drank at least 3 beers.Day 2: Rob leaves at 4pm for work. He comes back at night claiming that a train broke down due to weather, and he can’t make it back to his place, as he lives relatively far away and does not have his own car. To our knowledge, there were no public transport breakdowns and weather was fine.Day 3: Amy tells us that Rob’s uncle, whom he was staying with, is kicking him out because he believes that he was staying with his abusive ex-girlfriend.Day 4: Amy and Rob bring his stuff over. He is told the garage code, and we’re told he intends on staying here until his mom convinces his uncle to take him back. Amy says he has other friends, but they are not that close and he doesn’t want to bother their families by staying over. He makes money from his job ($700 in 3 days) and can afford a motel - they just don’t want to. For context, he is currently taking a break from his police diploma and working as a cook.Day 5: We stage an intervention and ask for next steps. We say our parents are uncomfortable with a stranger moving in. We get the same story about them not having options.Day 6: Today. We are lost.Rob’s red flags:He has NOT STOPPED drinking since he arrived, and there are several piles of beer cans in our house. No one in our house drinks.Rob wanted to see Amy as soon as she arrived after the winter break. His uncle “kicked him out” shortly after. We are wondering if he just needed a place to stay, and this worked out strangely conveniently.Amy has not been getting enough sleep/eating, or going to all her classes since this began.

My mom complains to me all the time that she hates when her mom tells her how to do anything in life. (Her dad, my maternal grandpa, was a pastor, her mom expected her to live up to every expectation they had and even into het 50s they tell her what shes doing wrong in her life.) This drives my mom nuts and she tells me all the time that she's an adult and she wishes her parents would stop telling her how to parent, how to spend money, etc. however, my mom likes to treat me the same way. She will give unwarranted parenting tips all the time, tell me I'm not enough of a helicopter parent, etc and it drives me absolutely bananas. Like, do you not see that you're being your mom? I digress...So. It's our first Christmas without my paternal grandpa, at paternal gma and gpas house. I'm sad, as my grandpa isn't there .. he was my favorite human. We got done giving gifts, everyone is laughing and having a good time. My mom prepared my grandpa's signature cheesey potato soup for our brunch and we set in to eat. My daughter is a year and a half and sitting between my husband and I. We were taking turns pulling out chunks of our soup to cool off for said daughter to eat. I touched one of the potato pieces to my lips and it was cool enough to eat so I offered it to my daughter.She ate it and made a face. She makes faces when she's not sure about textures or flavors, she's really only been eating for 9 months, of course she reacts to new foods.My mom says: \"it's too hot!\" I say, \"I felt it, it's fine\" She says \"you burned her, you have to pay attention!\"To which i said, quite calmly for myself, \" I have 2 children, I know how to feed them, she's fine, thank you.\"My mom's demeanor changed and she pouted for the rest of brunch and everyone changed the subject. I knew she was mad but I was happy for setting my boundary and I knew my daughter was fine, I literally tasted it first.My mom calls me over after brunch was done and told me to apologize. I asked for what and she said for snapping. I told her I didn't snap, I told her my boundary that was already in place- I know how to parent - dont tell me what to do. She pouted and told me to apologize again.So I gave her the old \"I'm sorry you feel that way.\"She told me that wasn't an apology.I told her I wasn't sorry, so I'm sorry she felt that way.She told me I was an asshole.I don't feel that I am.. I'm simply telling her I don't appreciate her stepping in where it's not necessary and I'm not sorry I firmly said what I said.

We made beef Wellington which is a real labor intensive dish to prepare and we provided a ton of food and drink for everybody. My mother and step father, step sister and her kids, my sister and her new boyfriend and aunt and uncle were there. After only 2 hours and before the dessert course was even served, my sister and her bf left “because she had a cat” and my step sister and nephews left because she was hung over from hosting a Christmas Eve party that we weren’t even invited to. After my sister left, my mom had asked me what I thought of her new boyfriend and I had responded that he seemed like a very nice guy but I found it very rude that they had chewed and screwed when we went through such effort to host people. My mom got mad that I said this in front of my aunt and uncle however I would have kept my opinion to myself had she not asked. AITA?Edited to add at the request of Other commenters: My mother is the one that has popularized the “chew and screw” phrase within my family. She has always previously been the host and would always say things like “don’t chew and screw” setting the tone for all that it is rude to leave before all dinner courses have been completed.",

	"body" : "for context, i (20f) am in my last year of my undergrad degree, and i still live with my parents. the summer after 1st year, i worked full time in order to save up money for rent so i could move out. i made roughly $8k the first summer. the bi-weekly payments were being directly deposited into my one of my accounts, which is a separate account from where i do my spending from.my dad insists on having access to my bank account at all times. i couldnt refuse because i live in his house and at the time, i didnt have the funds to just get up and leave as much as i would have loved to. so, he would always check my accounts, block my card so i would have to ask his permission to buy things, yell at me when he saw me buying food on campus, etc...last year, i asked to check the account where my job money was being deposited to see how much money i had saved up. i would always collect my paystubs so i knew exactly how much i should have earned at that point. i was shocked when i saw that there was around $6.5k missing. then i saw, my dad had been using the money from my job for his payments, hydro bills, new computers, etc...i blew up on him. he knew that i was saving the money up for rent and he didnt even ask me before spending almost all of it. he even denied it at first, said that \"the money is safe elsewhere\" but of course, i knew this was bs so i asked him to show me where every missing dollar was. he obviously couldnt.my home is extremely toxic and rapidly deteriorates my mental health. the one thing i could count on was me saving up money to move out on my own. and he took that away from me. we got into a huge argument about it again recently. he told me to \"shut up about it\" at first, but then said he \"made a mistake\" in a very condescending tone. i told him i would never forgive him for what he did, and i didnt consider him to be a father to me anymore.my mom says i was being too harsh. i told her my comment was built up for over a decade of my resentment for him, and that his controlling nature is unbearable. it wasnt just because of him taking my money, but the situation was the tipping point for me. she still thinks i was out of line since \"hes still your dad\"so AITA here ?EDIT: thank you guys so much for the comments. i didnt expect this post to blow up, and reading a lot of these comments made me cry because i underestimated my situation so much. i keep telling myself things can be worse so i shove them under the rug, so reading these comments was like an epiphany.i got a lot of comments telling me to take my dad to civil court. i will not be doing so, but i gave a lot of thought to it before choosing to stay quiet, and it is the decision ive made. i am working on getting a job without his knowledge and in the process of looking to open my own account at a different bank. i know things can get better and i am working towards it. thank you guys again <3",

He has three children from a previous relationship.To celebrate my youngest child’s 21st birthday,  I was planning a surprise holiday for us all to Disneyland. I found a great flight deal and was keen to get it booked. Prior to booking the holiday I spoke to Liam on the phone I told him my plan and asked him about his three children from the previous relationship coming. It was decided he’d speak to their mother, who is a very difficult character, to ask her permission. I booked the flight deal for 5, resigned to the fact that the flight cost would increase for the remaining 4 flights.The flights are over the Easter holiday, and Liams Ex has said the children cannot come. She wants to do an egg hunt with them. Liam wants to move the holiday to suit his ex. The dates suit my daughter whose 21st Birthday we are celebrating, and of course the cheap flight deal is a factor also.This has all backfired onto me because Liam is disappointed they can’t go, he says the other two shouldn’t go. He claims I am not treating the family the same, and has completely overlooked the conversation I had with him before booking, and the subsequent messages I have sent regarding an update on the booking.What should have been a lovely surprise for everyone has been ruined by Liams fury at his ex partner.So am I the asshole for booking the deal flights for my children and grandchildren and not waiting for response from his ex about their three children?",

At first, I was absolutely horrified by my dad's new partner, he had been with papa since they met at uni. Papa was a gorgeous, artistic, eccentric man, he was the best father you could've ever asked for, he left an impression on everyone he had ever met.By comparison, this new partner (Florence, 36) was a comedown. She really is just an average middle class woman, scared to death of anything even remotely 'out there.' She has rather rigid, narrow minded beliefs, she raised hell when she found out my A-Level choices (music, art, film studies) and tried to dictate that I change them to something more 'academic'.I feel as though Damon is only tolerating her because he's managed (somehow) to get her pregnant. They aren't exactly the most loved up couple, Damon has called her 'ghastly' before, and sometimes when she says something, he will roll his eyes.Damon, papa and I have always been vegetarian, ever since they've adopted me I have not tasted meat. I'm still vegetarian now, Damon is not. I refuse to eat meat in any context. Recently, Florence had stopped working and now she insists on making dinner for everyone (she doesn't let me cook my own.), it was fine when the food was veggie, but now she's practically serving meat any chance she gets. When she gave me a plate with meat on it, I reminded her that I'm vegetarian, which led to her insulting me by telling me I look anaemic and that i don't know what I'm missing out on.She started saying that I will need to start eating meat now that she's in control of meals, and to 'set an example' for her kid once it starts eating solids. I told her straight up that if that is the case, I refuse to eat anything she makes. I have stuck to it, I refuse to join them at dinnertime, I'm living off of avocado bagels, toast and snacks because she still isn't letting me cook. It's made her awfully upset and feel rejected.Florence has started calling me childish and ungrateful, and my grandparents (once they heard) said that I was creating resentment for no clear reason asides from spite, that I should stop for the pregnancy's sake. Damon congratulates me for my strong will, but even he says to just give in and stop the charade.",

	"body" : "Hi everyone, I’m in two minds about my response here and would like your opinions. Today, my husband and I (41M and F) took our young son to a kids performance at a local theatre. I booked us three seats on the end of a row. I tend to get quite anxious in crowds, so I prefer to sit on the end where I am not blocked in by strangers. About five minutes before the show started, a family of five (two parents, two young boys around 4-6 and a baby in arms) arrived. Turns out, they had booked last minute and did not have seats together. They sat the two boys in the empty seats directly in front of me, and had booked a spare seat in our row (beside my husband). Their remaining seat was right at the back of the theatre. The mother approached me and asked the three of us to move one seat down, so the father could sit directly behind their two kids, and she would sit at the back with the youngest on her lap. I said “No, sorry, I prefer not to do that. I booked these seats for a reason and would like to stay here.” She was not happy with this. Finally, after a lot of muttering, the dad sat in his booked seat, and she stomped off to the back, snapping “I hope this comes back to you.” I just told her she was the rude one, and sat back down to enjoy the show. The father and boys ended up moving to some vacant seats further back anyway, and she gave me a filthy look when we crossed paths in the auditorium after the show. I don’t think I did anything wrong. Sure, it would have been nice, but that was the seat I booked for a reason. AITA?",

When we told her she cried and she said she wasn’t ready to be grandma yet.My pregnancy wasn’t the greatest, he was 3 weeks early. The day after delivery my dad and his gf visited at the hospital. My dad held him for like 5 min after asking and when they were about to leave my mother in law came rushing through the door. She ran toward my bf who was holding our son, she basically ripped him from his arms and took off. All 4 of us where in shock as we couldn’t believe what just happened. Since we didn’t want to make a scene we let her hold him until we decided it was time to leave because we were all exhausted. She left. Still in shock I told my bf to please have a talk with her in a few days to tell her how inappropriate that was and to please ask when she wants to hold the baby. He did.A few days later we were finally able to go home. My parents in law visited us shortly after. Our son was asleep. When he woke up and started crying my bf went to the bedroom. His mum rushed after him and tried to grab him again to which my bf said that he was going to change the diaper and she cant have him rn. A few minutes later she left our apartment crying. My bf tried texting and calling but she didn’t answer. About two weeks later she texted him saying she missed my bf like nothing happened.On Christmas we were invited to her house for breakfast. We had a great time (or so I thought) until his mum disappeared. My bf said she left the house crying again. I honestly had no clue why… the baby was asleep the whole time and when he had a tummy ache I was holding him for 5 min until he fell back asleep. After an hour of her being gone we decided to leave. We said good bye to my father in law and my bf said “if she is ready to talk it out she knows my number” to which he replied “she isn’t going to call” my bf asked him what he meant by that and he just answered we know what we did and we should think about our behavior. I intervened and asked him what the problem was and what we did wrong and he just screamed in my face how horrible we are treating them and that we are withholding their grandson from them and that he specifically is not allowed near the baby, he a also called me a horrible mother and person for standing in between my bf family and our little family, which I never did. I told him that I was not going to let him scream at me like this so we left.After this me and my bf had a talk. I told him I was over this and I’m not having toxic people like them in my child’s life to which he completely agreed.My parents however think that I’m being cruel.So Reddit AITA?",

	"body" : "Hi folks, a lot of you asked me to update after my last post to let you know what I decided to do. Thank you to all the commenters who let me know I was not going crazy. Liz and Beth's insistence that I apologise was making me second guess myself, so I appreciate your help. Most of you also pointed out Beth’s reaction was enabling Jill, and Liz’s reaction was expecting me to roll over in the name of keeping the peace. I’ve come to realise that this has been a pattern for years in our group – playing peacekeeper to Beth and Liz “for the good of the group” – not only for me, but for Megan and Kelly as well.So, the update! I still haven’t heard from Beth, but Liz has been bombarding me with texts and voicemails saying I was out of order and owe all three of them apologies for how I acted and for continuing to drag things out. She even suggested “as a way to start making it up” I should take everyone (including Jill) to a restaurant and pay for everything. I have no desire to spend what would be a month’s rent on their drinks bill alone, not to mention I don't feel I've done anything wrong.Frankly, that she even suggested this only persuaded me more to cut her off. I met up with Megan and Kelly last night and told them that I not apologising to Jill - frankly, she’s stuck in her high school mean girl era and I'd be glad never to see her again. I also said I am sick of swallowing my feelings to avoid tension because Liz and Beth never apologise, and I am cutting contact with Beth and Liz.I was expecting protests about breaking up the group… I did not expect Megan to admit she’s only stuck with Liz for so long because, like me with Beth, Liz was one of her only friends during her bullied years and she didn’t want to “ruin our dynamic by acting out of turn”. Or for Kelly to say that for years she’s been sick of Liz and Beth treating the three of us like we’re inferior but and she was worried if she spoke up about it, she’d lose me and Megan as well.We all had a very overdue chat about how we all really feel about this group and agreed that Beth and Liz are not true friends to any of us. Kelly and Megan showed me their messages from Beth and Liz, basically painting me as some kind of demon hellbent on ruining their lives. I had to laugh at the one from Liz reminding them both of how I ruined her wedding by not attending due to my selfish, selfish emergency surgery. This was five years ago and I’m only now hearing that I ruined things ... because some guests asked after my health at the reception and drew attention away from her big day. Clearly, I am an awful person for this.Anyway, we are completely cutting contact. We've saved our messages just in case (cos I don’t see Jill, Beth or Liz disappearing quietly from our lives once they realise we’re not going to play ball) but in the meantime, we're planning a zoo trip next week, so will enjoy a day out free of drama!",

Before that we were long distance and I used to send her flowers for special occasions and sometimes just because. I often spent a good deal of money on a dozen roses. She was very grateful and would say how when she looked at them it reminded her of me and made her smile. It might be worth noting she never brought me flowers, but that didn't bother me as its a bit of a girly thing (no judgement or whatever, but honestly I could care less about flowers).Anyway, now to the issue at hand. Since living together I haven't brought her flowers - honestly I hadn't really thought to, because I'm right here in the same flat and so she doesn't need a reminder of me. Well just before Christmas she brought a Christmas flower arrangement, which I figured was just part of decorating for christmas. Early January she threw it out, and in its place appeared another vase of flowers, which I didn't say anything about because she was not working (she's a private school teacher and was off for their Christmas holidays) and I figured she's just bored. But I guess they died and now there's another vase of flowers in its place, and this time it's a dozen roses!I asked her what was up with the roses, and she said she likes flowers and that as I never buy her them anymore she has decided to get them for herself. I didn't say anything at the time but this has really got to me questioning her. It seems really passive aggressive to go out and buy roses for yourself just to make a point (literally identical to the arrangements I brought for her!). And now every time I walk into the kitchen I am hit with how shitty a boyfriend she thinks I am.Edit: I appreciate the comments, even though some of them were hard to swallow.It seems the jury is split, I’m either an unloving asshole because I've overlooked an obvious hint to gift my girlfriend flowers and make her happy, or I’m a self-absorbed asshole and her purchasing flowers isn't anything to do with me.

There’s enough parking, but inconsiderate parking is common.At 6:45pm, I want to leave to buy groceries before a snow storm that’s coming the next day, but my driveway is fully blocked by a truck.I have a neurological disorder and am always extremely physically and mentally exhausted, but especially at the end of the day. I’m disabled and unable to work. This is a profound inconvenience.My partner and I deliberate reporting the truck. We’d typically wait or not call at all, but with snow coming and tow trucks busy and maybe unavailable the next day, we want the truck gone soon. We expect a delay and we buffer for that since we learn the tow company does not tow after 11pm tonight.I have good reason for needing access to this car. I’m responsible for managing a property for my mom and caring for my wife’s elderly parents. Plus, my wife is pregnant, so I want to be able to take her to the hospital if necessary. Also, I want emergency vehicles to be able to access our driveway if something happens.I assume that anyone in our neighborhood would be familiar enough and considerate enough to not block a driveway. I assume it is someone out at nearby bar.I check with one next door neighbor, who says it isn’t his. The other next door neighbor’s lights are off, and they have young kids, so I don’t want to bother them.My Reddit research of old post tells me that people in my city would absolutely immediately tow someone blocking their driveway, so I feel comfortable calling in the car. 90 minutes later, it had been ticketed and towed.My friends say I absolutely am not responsible for locating the driver seeing as we live in a city, and anyone who would block a driveway is the scum of the earth.My neighbor who lives diagonally across the street, however, is livid that I did not notice his dinner party and lights. He was upset that we called for the tow at all because our driveway wasn’t blocked for that long and accused us of not using the car the next day. He apologized for some of this but still doesn’t understand how I did not see his party and knock. His friend was the driver.  (Edit: the driver claims to have made a mistake and did not block my driveway intentionally. I think he’s appropriately ashamed and not an asshole)He says there were cars clustered around his house. I noticed cars parked everywhere. I didn’t notice his lights. He lives in an elevated triplex house. I’ve never been inside and don’t know which floors are his.He thinks it is crazy I didn't go door-to-door to find his friend. He says he polled many other neighbors about my behavior, finding that they would go door-to-door knocking to find the driver.I’m not a very social person, and knocking on everyone’s door to track down the person is alien to me. Also I don’t want to inconvenience them for one person’s mistake. It inconveniences me when people knock on my door. My dog gets anxious and it is a whole process getting her to settle down. And that wakes up my kid too.EDIT: Thanks for the responses! I’ll probably not respond to any more of them because I’m trying to let this all go.

The school has had to speak with Cheyenne about bullying other students and cheating on assignments.My brother Matt and SIL Sofi are too soft on my niece. When she gets in trouble, they’ll basically tell her “Now, Cheyenne, that wasn’t nice but we know how hard it is to be a teenager so let’s get some ice cream.” There’s no real consequences.The reason they do this is because Sofi acted out as a teen. Her parents were strict and Sofi claims that being punished and seeing her parents disappointed made everything worse, so they don’t want to do that with Cheyenne.Now I’m all for trying to reason with and hear out your kids instead of just going straight to punishment. But if your kid shows they aren’t taking the soft talks seriously, then that’s when you have to dish out some tough love with firm talks and hard consequences. I can talk to my niece and her parents about her behavior, but anything more than that is sadly out of my power.I’m writing because Cheyenne’s AVID program hosted a Disney trip to celebrate the end of finals and the start of Christmas break. Matt begged me to pick Cheyenne up because she was caught shoplifting from a store and he and Sofi weren’t able to leave work.I was informed when picking up my niece that she was not welcome back to the park and she was being placed on a form of probation in her AVID program. Luckily, she has not gained any kind of criminal record.Instead of being grateful for this, Matt and Sofi complained that adults should understand that breaking rules is a normal thing teens do because their brains are still developing. They went as far as to express this opinion online after the school informed them that my niece will not be allowed on any school trips for the foreseeable futureSofi called to tell me that people nowadays are selfish and nobody cares about each other anymore. Her reasoning was that the post got many views but few likes and comments. She claimed kids are depressed and anxious because schools put too much pressure on them and don’t let kids be kids.I made a neutral comment about being sorry to hear that. But then Sofi tried to call me out because I didn’t comment to show support for Cheyenne and called me selfish too. I had enough and told Sofi that it just comes off as whiny for her and Matt to be blaming kids having depression and anxiety on schools for expecting them to behave themselves if they want to go on school trips.Matt got on the phone to tell me off but I told them to stop expecting people to feel sorry for them. They’re ruining their daughter’s future by being soft instead of dishing out some tough love.

We recently got an invitation for their wedding, and my mom and I were SO excited. My mom and I have been on a weight loss journey together, and she’s lost a lot of weight. I’m so proud of her. She says she wants to wear something fancy by wedding time to show off her weight loss. That’s not the problem though. She says she wants to wear a white pantsuit to the wedding. Normally I’d be all for this, but I’ve recently (over the past year) learned that a lot of the time white in general is a no-no at weddings. I get it’s not a wedding dress, but still, I don’t want them to think we’re trying to steal the spotlight on their special day. Especially now that both of them are in our lives again.

I’m not sure if it would be a problem to the bride or not, but I only learned recently and wanted her to keep it in mind as well. Now she refuses to talk about it at all. Am I the asshole? And would my mom be one if she wore white to their wedding?Edit: To clear things up…We are from, and live in the Southern US.He is not from my mom’s side of the family.The wedding is a good bit away, and my mom has not gone suit shopping yet, so there is no suit as of now.My mother is severely introverted, so I don’t think it’s seeking to steal the spotlight, but more genuine delusion and wanting to wear a color she was afraid to before.UPDATE: The wedding is still months away, but I decided to try and talk to my mother again about the issue. I calmly asked if we could talk, and she agreed. I cannot tell if it went good or bad. For ease of time and understanding, I’ll write the conversation in a script-like format:Me: (trying to tread lightly) Okay, so you remember a month or so ago when you mentioned what you were going to wear to -Cousins name-‘s wedding?Mom: sighsMe: I just wanted to bring it up once more, because you seemed to be stressed/in a pain flare that day, and I don’t want you thinking I was trying to dictate you, or talk down to you at all. I’ve just done even more research, and I just wanted you to know-Mom: OP, I don’t even know what I’m going to wear. It’s months away.Me: I get that, it’s just that the color you had mentioned- Mom: (growing defensive again) I said I would wear an off-white suit. It’s a different color. It was just what came to my head. I’m not planning on wearing anything white or lacy, I’m not trying to upstage anyone.Me: I understand you aren’t, I didn’t think you were. I just know that a lot of brides take offense to both white and off-white, sometimes even pastels-Mom: (growing agitated) I’m not trying to upstage anyone, OP. I never would do that. I never try to hurt anyone, you know me!Me: I do! And I’m not accusing you of anything! I’m just trying to help-Mom: OP, I have been on this planet for almost 60 years. I know how this world works, I’m not an idiot.Me: I’m not saying you are! I’m just trying to suggest that we ask the bride for a dress code so we know her boundaries for when we shop-I’ll cut the rest short from here. It led to her getting incredibly upset. She screamed that she wouldn’t “wear fucking white” and while I explained I wasn’t trying to tell her what to do, and that I was just trying to warn her, she wouldn’t hear me. It took a minute, but she finally started to calm down, and proceeded to explain that she felt incredibly talked down to. No matter how hard I tried to explain I was just trying to have a conversation, she said it didn’t matter. That’s how she felt. My mother grew up in an incredibly abusive environment, and sometimes when someone is talking to her, it can trigger her PTSD. Shes back to being small, being talked to like she’s nothing, and her fight or flight turns to fight. Especially if she’s already stressed or in a pain flare. The plan was to bring it up for a short convo, then later and closer to the time bringing bridal articles up. But I didn’t take into account how stressed and in pain she’s been lately, so that short conversation quickly became something triggering for her. I’m not claiming this is anything healthy, nor that this is an excuse. I’m aware it isn’t, and so is she. But it’s our reality as she attempts to heal as an adult now. She apologized, and explained that it was her, not me. That I did not deserve to be spoken to or yelled at that way, and that she had no idea where that fire came from. She said there was absolutely no excuse for that, and that she was 100% in the wrong. I expressed that I understood, and that I’m proud of her for recognizing it and grounding herself. She explained that the suit was simply a passing thought, and she didn’t know what she would wear. But that she never intended to upstage or hurt anyone. I told her I know she wouldn’t do that, and that even though her trauma told her it was, my words were never meant to make her feel like a bad person with malice in her heart. She has also told me before how when others respond calmly in discourse, it can trigger her even more. She’s not used to people responding to agitation with calm, her childhood was entirely being screamed at. That was her normal. So as she grew agitated, it only got worse as I remained resolute. It threw her off. That is also something she is working on in therapy. She continued to apologize and express her shame, saying that when the time comes to shop for attire, we can message the bride if I want. She never associated off-white with being the same as white when it comes to weddings, and she herself doesn’t see the issue with it nor why it’s so offensive, but she understands that others feel another way.So yeah…So far the plan is to ask the bride around shopping time, and to find whatever best fits her. Hopefully she’s feeling better by then too. Seeing her eyes in moments like these is truly heartbreaking sometimes. You can almost see how small she feels. And I can now understand more why she grew defensive the first time I brought it up. It was less a suspect being caught, like some of you had suggested, and more someone who’s used to being called horrible things instinctively trying to defend her character and actions like she’s had to do many a time in the past. We have a long way to go, both till the wedding and in my mother’s healing journey. But I hope this can answer some questions and maybe give some form of resolution. I will update again if you all would like once it’s closer to the wedding. Thank you to everyone who gave their advice, and to those who made me laugh. TL;DR: My mother’s trauma response led her to lashing out, though she has since apologized. She never intended to wear white to hurt anyone. We will be contacting the bride closer to the wedding to get a dress code.",

That line of work led me to meet and interact with some famous people here and there.

My mother says she was just proud of me and there’s no harm in her talking about my “success” (her words, not mine – I never called myself successful). I got the feeling that she also wants to rub my career in her sisters' faces (the ones who so loudly criticized my choices) - if that's the case, this is something she is doing for her own reasons, because I don't care about that and don't need my mother to defend me.I told her all of that, and to make sure she understood I was serious, I said I wouldn't go back home so soon if that's what I have to deal with when I'm there. Later, she told my father (62M) about our talk, and he told me she was very upset that I called her out over a simple “proud mama” behavior. Was I the AH to say anything?

A few of the boys in her class are friends with the boy, they were playing basketball at recess when he asked to speak to his friends.He told them my daughter and her friends were bullying this boy because he is transgender. The other boys immediately went to the teacher to tell her, even though he asked them not to because he was scared of the social consequences.When my husband and I found out about this, we were furious. It’s also personal for my husband, he’s a teacher and a baseball coach and he has a student who’s an 8th grader and is a trans boy, the boys on his team are friends with this boy and while he doesn’t play with them, he helps out with a lot of the behind the scenes stuff (like equipment, acting as a scorekeeper at games). He knows how much both his players and the trans student admire him.We told our daughter she was grounded until further notice, she lost all electronics, she can’t see her friends outside of school, ect.

Last time I F(22) saw him M(10), he was just over 4, and this was his first visit in all these years. We only managed to spend a handful of times together over the break, and he's set to leave in a week.I'm anticipating one last meet-up in a few days, and my stepmom (SMom) gave me a talk about not crying when I see him. Her concern stemmed from a previous instance where I cried as I said goodbye to him and his family, thinking it was our final day together before they headed back. On that occasion, he cried too, as we had anticipated and discussed the night before. We both acknowledged our sadness and the fact that we'd miss each other dearly. That day though, I wasn’t sobbing, just visibly tearful and upset. In fact, I was even the one comforting and reassuring my cousin that everything would be okay and I’m only a message away. He also had a choice to stay another day, but I told him his other cousins who lived a few cities away might miss him too.During the talk, my SMom reminded me, \"You saw that he was upset, so you have to control yourself.\" To which I responded, \"I promise, I really tried to hold it back as much as possible, and that’s something I thought of too.\" Knowing he's younger, I understood the expectation for me to be \"stronger.\" Despite my assurance, my SMom reiterated not to cry, asking, \"Don’t you feel bad for him?\" I repeated what I said again, but with a bit of a tone which I feel bad about. After that, everything was a bit of a blur as I just kept nodding and I tried to make my mind wander off so as to not speak anymore ill. The conversation ended and there’s a bit of tension now, but I wouldn’t know how bad till the morning.My SMom has always been better at holding her tears back. I, on the other hand, am admittedly more emotional. However, I was taken aback as it seemed as if I hadn't considered my cousin's feelings if I cried and hadn't attempted to be strong. It's worth noting that the uncertainty of their next visit added to my emotions. He's like a brother, and his mom was almost like a second mother during my upbringing, so all the distance is hard.

Anyway my sister (28f) had a baby and is always telling me how hard it is to manage as a sahm while her husband is working and how amazing it would be if someone could watch her baby so both of them could have a job (she doesn't want to apply her to kindergarden or pay a babysitter cuz it's expensive) i tried to change conversation cuz i knew that she wanted me to babysit my niece, but then she straight up asked me if i would be willing to be her nanny till she's at least 2-3 so that they wouldn't have to pay a stranger to babysit her. I told her that it wouldn't be possible cuz 1 i'm applying to college next year and 2 i have a job so i wouldn't have time for it, she told me that i could just quit cuz \"it's not even a real job\". While i do agree with her that my part time job isn't something special, i'm still getting some pocket money out of it, i then told her that i'll quit and babysit my niece till next year when i'll have to apply, but only if she pays me 30.000rsd monthly, win-win situation right? I mean babysitters are usaully paid $5/hour here where i live so that sounded like a great deal to me but looks like it's not, she got mad that i'll even request something like that and that it's selfish to demand money for babysitting my own flesh and blood (her words) I told her then that i'm not quitting my \"fake job\" to babysit my niece and that she'll have to figure it out. We're currently not speaking much and when we do she tries to change my mind about quiting my part time job, my family thinks that i'm in the wrong here and should help my sister out so i'm not sure what to do. Posting this here so that i could get some other opinions and maybe some solutions cuz idk how to go from here.Edit: Thank you for all the advices and kind words that i got in the past hour :) it means so much to me, just wanted to clarify that i won't leave my part time job or apply to college 3 years later just cuz of my sister, I'll try to talk to my family and sister about it again later but don't think that it'll change anything, maybe in their eyes i'm being selfish and a bad aunt, but i know that it isn't true. I love my niece but i'm not her guardian and i have priorities and my own life, for now i'll just focus on getting into my college of choice and making most of my teenage years. A part time job is more than enough, i don't want to be the parent that i never knew i would be pressured to be.

Seeing my wife behind this woman, I motioned for her to come around since I was ahead and ready to start unloading our items and checking out.This is where things took a turn. The woman behind me got upset and accused me of cutting in line, arguing that she should be first because my trolley wasn't with me; it was behind her. Ordinarily, I might have let it slide, but her accusatory attitude rubbed me the wrong way. Despite having no particular urgency, her tone prompted me to stand my ground.I explained to her that I had joined the queue before her, and since my wife and I were together, our collective position took priority. She countered, insisting that the physical location of the trolley mattered more, claiming I couldn't hold the spot for someone else. Our exchange continued with the same arguments until she eventually gave up and moved to another queue.To the best of my knowledge, the UK follows a \"first come, first serve\" rule for queuing, and I believe that by bringing my wife to my position, I wasn't violating any norms.

	"body" : "I (21f) live with my dad, stepmom (who I’ll refer to as mom sometimes in this post), and my siblings, 26m, 10m, and sometimes 19f depending if she’s home from college. For starters, I don’t have any dietary restrictions, and I’m not particularly picky. But this issue has come up and I’m unsure if I’m being a brat.My mom cooks dinner just about every weekday and always makes enough for everyone to have some. When she does that I always make a point to eat it whenever I’m hungry, but sometimes I’ll be craving particular things, so every now and then I’ll swing by Walmart and pick up some things I want. These things can range anywhere from salads to super spicy noodles, that kind of thing. I’m not the kind of person to be greedy; I don’t mind sharing, but some things have been happening that frustrated me to a certain extent.An example of this being I bought two cake pops for me and my younger brother. I stuck them in the fridge and told my mom that one was for me and one was for him, and she said ok. When I came down that night to eat mine, I found them both gone. When I asked my mom, she said he had eaten both because he just assumed they were both for him. This kind of irked me, but I figured ok, it was my fault for not telling him directly. Then came the incident with the noodles I had bought. They were these super spicy, super specific types of noodles you can only get from being shipped worldwide. I bought 3 of them, and I had them in the pantry. My younger brother had seen them and asked, and I explained they were super hot and he probably wouldn’t like them since he has no tolerance for spice. I told him if he wanted to try them one day, I’ll let him take a bite of mine, but I knew he wouldn’t be able to eat a whole pack. So one day I come downstairs craving them, and the last pack is gone. When I ask, my dad said my brother wanted them and made them for him, but they were so spicy that he could only eat two bites before it was too much. Sure enough, the noodles are in the trash, and it really pissed me off. There are other examples but these are the main ones that popped into my mind.So like 3 days ago I went to Walmart, spent quite a bit of money on stuff I wanted, like juices and teas and other things like that. When I got home I didn’t think much of it, putting stuff in the fridge. Before I went upstairs, my older brother asked if he could have some of the lemonade I just bought. I said sure, he poured himself a glass, and I went upstairs. When I came down that same night, I couldn’t find the lemonade anywhere. I asked my older brother where it went, and he said “Oh, I drank it all so I threw it away”. I don’t know why but it made me so upset, but I didn’t say anything to him. So some of the stuff I bought, like my mini gatorades and protein powder for post workouts came upstairs with me and I put it in my room.Now my dad and mom are upset with me, saying I’m being greedy and that food was shareable in the house. But I don’t think I did anything wrong, so AITA?",

They have been constantly fighting over the toys every single day since, because only one of the boys can play with the toy at a time. The cart is broken, because they kept fighting over it.

I didn't want to just show up with a date to family events without letting the hosts (one of my older sisters and her family) know.I called my older sister in the morning and she was completely okay with meeting my bf. I was excited to share about him. :) that afternoon, my younger sister texted me that she could have gotten a free size 4 wedding dress from Facebook marketplace (in the city I live in) and I asked if she wanted me to pick it up for her. She said no, it wasn't really her style but it would have been fun to try on. Plus, she was waiting for the dress she'd ordered online to arrive. She then sent me a Screenshot of a size 12 wedding dress for $80 with the caption \"Here's one for you. Lol. I've tried clicking Facebook to show me less but I haven't been successful yet.\"I assumed that she'd found out from our one sister I dating so I sent back a pic of myself and my bf. While she had been immediately responding she now took 4 minutes to respond with, \"Who's that?\" I told her \"my boyfriend\". She said, \"He looks happy\".I got on the phone with her and asked if she knew I was dating. She said no, she was surprised to hear it. When I said she was rude to send a wedding dress to someone she thought was single and had been for 15 years she told me that I was the one with the problem and she had sent it to me because it was obviously too big for her and something I could actually afford.I told her congratulations on her upcoming marriage and that obviously we still have difficulty communicating with each other. We both have talked to our sisters and mom about this situation and while I know it's silly, it bothers me that I was told I was the one being rude when I called her rude for sending it. Aita?Edit- after reading the comments I think it's clear that it's not a simple issue. Some people understand why I was hurt and felt like she was rude. Some people see her side that she was trying to connect and agree that I was rude. I do try to take a step back in situations where I feel emotional. I truly appreciate every single one of you that responded. Life is complicated and emotions even more so. I don't need to know if IATA anymore because the reality is both of us have things to work on. I know I need to not take things personally and at the end of day- this is a ridiculous thing to be upset over when there are so many more truly life altering things to worry about. I'm going to just keep being happy that she's happy and move forward.Edit 2- the history with this particular sister is that she regularly has made fun of my weight, job, looks, clothing choices, etc. One example is telling me that if I ever wanted to start dating I'd need to slim up first because no one would find me attractive where I'm at. Some additional context below. -I'm happy with where I'm at physically- I'm a body builder and had several serious injuries from car wrecks last year but I'm doing great just being able to walk and starting to workout again! Yay!my sister and I slowed communication because she wanted me to join a dating app just so we could swap bad date stories and make fun of the people we met. I told her I didn't find it fun to make fun of people and it's also one of the reasons I didn't want to talk about who I dated until it was serious.my sister had announced she was getting engaged 3 months before. I wanted my family to meet my bf at Christmas for two reasons: most important, we are serious and I would love my family to get to know him. 2-I genuinely didn't want to take attention off my sister's big day. I thought it would be a huge thing to show up with a serious bf at her wedding that no one knew about and would take the attention away from her. I 100% did not want to do that.I'm currently a12/14 street clothes which is a16/18 wedding. My sister is a0/2 and is altering a size 4 wedding dress smaller.As I said in my previous edit, I've realized it really is a ridiculous thing to be upset about. I'm happy for her, I'm hoping she has an amazing marriage and that she is super happy for the rest of her life. That should and will be my focus going forward. Thank you all again for reading and have a great new year!",

He is a quite well-known author in my country, like the kind to be interviewed on TV.Every year when he release a book, he gifts his new book, each member of the family get a copy (I assume a free copy since I dont think he pays for those). When he doesnt have a book to offer, he doesnt make a gift (his wife does).A few months ago, I saw on social media he will release a book in 2024.When I saw him at our grandparents house, with a few people in the kitchen, I told him laughing \"I hope you will not get us a draft of your future book\". He looked at me like I was dead or Satan and left the room. He apparently complained to some other members of the family on my \"personnal attack\" and how it's not respectful of the Christmas spirit.His real gift? A draft copy of his future book with the clear mention that he want members of the family to read it quickly to correct potential mistakes/typos. Nobody complained about this fucking weird \"gift\". I couldnt either since apparently he burnt my copy but i asked my mother loudly so anyone could hear \"and where the real Shakespeare's gift?\".Everyone think I'm the asshole for disrespecting Christmas spirit and attacking my uncle, which I should be grateful he let us read his books free since he is so famous.

	"title" : "AITA for getting upset about my aunt and her boyfriend going into my bedroom",
	"body" : "I was hosting Christmas day dinner at my house for the 3rd time. We had several guests over and I was in full hostess mode cooking/filling glasses/cleaning/chatting. I was filling the tea kettle and noticed my bedroom door was open. I live in an open concept house and the primary bedroom suite is off of the living room, but I had kept the door shut. The guest bathroom is by the entrance and I left the door open so I could tell guests where it was when they came in. I also have two bedrooms near the entrance (a guest room and office) and left the doors open and had people put their coats on the guest bed. The only door that was kept shut was to my bedroom, which I thought was the universal sign for \"keep out\". Compared to the rest of the house, my bedroom is a lot messier--I temporarily relocated a bunch of stuff to the room and had some fresh laundry on the bed I didn't have time to fold. My bathroom and closest was a disaster from a very full weekend of parties--I kept the door shut to hide my shame. So, when I saw the door open I panicked. I ran over and saw that my aunt and her new boyfriend were standing in the bathroom with the lights on. I told her the bathroom was messy and the guest bathroom was a lot tidier, and she said she only wanted to show her boyfriend my walk-in closet. I said \"can you please not? It's messy and I don't want people in here\". And they left. Later, after most guests had left, my aunt privately told me I let the \"stress of hosting\" get to me and embarrased myself and her. She said her boyfriend has to sit on her cat hair-covered couch all the time and that a full laundry hamper and some pantyhose are nothing to freak out over. I don't think I freaked out, but I was stressed and that might have come out in my tone. What she said also made me think: I did invite people to my house, so maybe I was being unreasonable in trying to keep guests out of certain rooms? I don't know if my parents told me this or I just picked it up, but if a door is closed I don't go in without knocking/ getting permission--but is that the norm?TLDR: I might be an asshole for getting upset about guests going into my closed bedroom during a party.",

	"title" : "AITA For Saying I Would Exclude My Father's Family From My Wedding?",
	"body" : "I (26 F) have been in a relationship for a while now and during the holidays the topic of weddings came up while my mother and I were in the car together running errands. When we got to the topic of who I would invite/how large the wedding would be, I said I would be inviting almost no one from my father's side to the wedding apart from one cousin my siblings and I were close to growing up.My mother was visibly upset. My father is the youngest child in a massive and close family (16 siblings) and they are all very close and have keys to each other's houses, always visit randomly, help with maintenance - the large farm family type. Most of my cousins have had huge weddings (guest lists over 1k and renting out event centers) and my siblings and I are pretty much that side's last chance for their huge family weddings.The issue mainly rests with my uncle and his wife. They live super close to us and, like the rest of them, had access codes to our house and security systems. This doesn't pose an issue with the rest of my aunts and uncles but one time I drove home sick in the middle of the school day and found my aunt in my sisters' room rummaging through their drawers. When I found her there she ran up, hugged me, said hello, and then left.When I called my parents at work to ask if she was supposed to be there and what she was doing rummaging through their drawers (my sisters were 10 & 12 at the time and she only had boys in college) my parents said her washing machine was broken and she needed to use ours. When I commented it was weird they brushed it off.This was not the only time they have been weird throughout my life. As children, we would play in my relatives' basements with their toys and my uncle would ALWAYS volunteer to get the kids for dinner. On our way up the stairs, he would pat our behinds. He would also ask only the girls for hugs and they would always be uncomfortably long. He would tickle us until we were crying and asking him to stop. This continued into our teens when my sisters and I basically stopped going to family gatherings and if they ever came over we would hide in our rooms.My parents know about all of that but still invite them over, they just ended up begrudgingly changing the house codes after we wouldn't let it go. As far as I know, my parents have never brought it up to anyone and change the subject when it comes up.I think leaving one family/sibling out of a wedding would be more drama than just having a super small and intimate wedding and only having super close friends and immediate family come (leaving that whole side out almost altogether). My sisters are on the same page as me. My parents disagree and have been upset with me ever since saying I planted this idea in my sister's heads and that I am ruining their chance at having a large family wedding, reciprocating what their siblings did, and that I am/would be causing unnecessary drama.

	"title" : "AITA for refusing to go to my cousin’s wedding because my boyfriend is not invited ?",
	"body" : "I (26F) have been dating my boyfriend Mike (25M) (obviously fake name) for about a year and a half. We are in a very serious and committed relationship, so serious that we are talking marriage and kids and we are currently looking to move in together. I was never one to date or go out with men in general so needless to say Mike is the first guy I’ve felt so serious about to introduce him to my family.Now, my cousin (31M) and his soon to be wife (34F) are getting married later this year, my cousin invited me couple of weeks ago and I accepted even though I don’t like his fiancé that well but because he’s family and in my culture weddings are a big deal so I kind of didn’t have a choice. I, in my mind, was thinking that the invitation was for me AND for my boyfriend since the whole family have known about him for a while and they have met him on multiple occasions.Today, I decided to ask my cousin about the plans of the wedding day to be up to date with everything and mentioned my boyfriend, that’s when he told me that the invitation was for me and me only, that they decided to invite family and close friends only and that it’s too late now because they’ve already planned the exact amount of food with the caterer, I said that I assumed that the invitation was for the both of us and that it doesn’t make sense to invite me and not my partner, the wedding is in MONTHS and they could still arrange with the catering company for one more plate. He said that they already paid and it wasn’t possible to add more people, that’s when I told him that I will not be attending the wedding because in my opinion it’s insulting to not include my partner who has been sharing my life for over a year.He didn’t reply but I received a call from my other cousin telling I’m TA for THREATENING to not come to the wedding, I told her I didn’t threaten not to come I am genuinely not coming, she said it’s ridiculous to expect my boyfriend to be invited and that I should just suck it up and be there for my family.So reddit, AITA for refusing to go to the wedding because my boyfriend is not invited or should I just stfu and go alone ?PS: I have to mention that my parents and siblings live in a totally different country, so I am living alone here that’s why, for me, it’s important to have my boyfriend with me during these occasions since I can’t have any other close member of my family, he kind of became my only close family here.EDIT: there seems to be some confusions so I will try to answer some questions and add some clarifications here.- Other family members and friends got the same invitation as me with the same wording and had their partners invited, not only married or engaged couples, just couples in general so before even talking with my cousin in the first place I already knew other couples are invited and going as couples, hence my reaction of finding it insulting that specifically my boyfriend was not included.- Some people seem to think that I threw a tantrum and made this about me, which I totally didn't. I do understand that I was wrong for assuming my boyfriend was invited and should've asked when I first got the invitation just to make sure. But I didn't in any way or form threw a tantrum, I politely asked if it was still possible to arrange with the caterer and when he said no I simply said that I will not be able to make it without my boyfriend. The other cousin who called me TA is the sister of the groom and I calmly explained to her that I just find it insulting that other couples are invited as couples but I was invited alone even though my cousin knows my boyfriend and that I would just rather skip the wedding.- Some people are saying that my relationship isn't \"serious\" enough for him to get an invitation and that we aren't even living together. I did mention that we were \"talking\" about moving in together, maybe I should've been more precise and added that we are actively looking for a new appartement and by the time the wedding comes we would be, very likely, already living together. My cousin does know all of this since he's the one who helped to find and move in my current appartement and he knows that I will be moving out in a few weeks/months to live with my boyfriend.- I did mention that I disliked the bride and some of you think it may be why they didn't extend my invitation. Not that it's important to mention this, but the reason why I dislike her is that I, on multiple occasions, have seen her being very mean to my cousin's 5 year old kid (from a previous union), she gives me mean stepmom vibes which is the reason why I dislike her in the first place. But that is my personal opinion, I have never discussed this with my cousin or anyone else in the family so this has nothing to do with the whole argument, I just mentioned that I dislike her to explain that I wasn't so excited about going to the wedding in the first place but I had do.- Many people seem to not get my point here, I do agree that I should've never expected my boyfriend to be invited, he is not officially a member of the family yet and I shouldn't have assumed that just because they know him he should get invited, I also shouldn't have asked if they could still arrange with the caterer to include my boyfriend, it's their wedding and they decide to invite who they want and it's not my place to ask from them to include someone just because of me, that was a mistake on my end. But that was not my original question here, I asked if I was TA for declining the invitation and not if I was TA for expecting my boyfriend to be invited.",

My sister is Laura (37f), her husband is Ken (36m), and their son is Aiden (6m).I'm planning to take my kids to Disney world next year for Amy's 10th birthday.  While discussing plans for the trip, Anna and I thought we might offer to take Aiden with us.  Amy and Connie get along well with Aiden, and he's never been.  I'm not sure if Aiden will get the chance to go otherwise.  Laura and Ken don't have a ton of money.  They don't lack for necessities, but they don't have much disposable income beyond that.When I brought this up with Laura she was super excited at first.  She told me they'd love to go with us.  I told her that I'd be happy to have the whole family along but I was only offering to pay Aiden's way.  She got pissed at that.  She said it was unfair for me to take him without them because they'd miss out on getting to enjoy those special moments with their son.  She said I was was lording my money over them and trying to buy their son's love.Where I might be a bit of an asshole here is that I view Laura and Ken's financial situation as voluntary.  Laura makes pretty decent money as an engineer, but Ken has never worked.  Not before Aiden was born, not after Aiden started school.  He has a college degree, he has no disabilities, he just chooses not to work.  I don't understand it, but at the end of the day it works for them and it's really none of my business, so I've never said anything to them about it.  But I do see their money problems as self-inflicted and because of that I choose not to help them out financially a lot of the time even if I could afford to.Anyway, I got kind of mad at Laura saying I'm lording my money over them and trying to buy their son's love.  I told her it's not my fault that they can't afford to go to Disney world and that I thought I was doing something nice by taking Aiden with me.  If I thought she was going to get mad at me for offering to do something nice I would never have offered in the first place.  Laura said I'm putting her in an impossible situation since if Aiden ever found out he could have gone to Disney World and she didn't let him he'd never forgive her.  I said that was her problem and the offer to take Aiden (and only Aiden) still stood.Anna doesn't thing I'm wrong, but she thinks to keep the peace we should just take the whole family.  We could afford to if we stretched things a little bit.  I see it as I'm already offering to do something extremely generous and that Laura and Ken are just trying to take advantage of me.

My soon to be wife is on my side because she likewise wouln't dream of my parents interfering in her dress choice.I'm standing firm on wanting the morning suits for my side, but it's causing some serious tension. Am I the asshole here? Should I stick to my original plan or try to find a middle ground? Feeling a bit lost, and the wedding is creeping closer.",

	"title" : "AITA for telling my siblings they are not my doctor? Then hanged up on my mom.",
	"body" : "I 36(f) am in a large family. I am one of the youngest of 7 kids. We are close but have had issues in the past. Most of my siblings are strong able bodied people. I am neurodivergent and physically disabled. I have lupus and a protein c deficiency. Because of how bad my illness is there are times I can barely move and my kidneys are currently covered in blood clots.I have been betrayed by friends and it is hard to get people to help me. My husband cant always help me. So I bit the bullet and asked my siblings to help me with chores in my house. My siblings are very into keto and holistic medicine. They believe it is bad that I take immunosuppressive drugs. But if I didn't my blood clots would not go away. Lupus patients are prone to kidney disease and joint issues. I have both.So one day my siblings were going on how I eat badly and need to get off coffee. Let alone I drink coffee once a day and eat more veggies, fruit and lean meat than them. My brother was telling me I had to cook with tallow and eat liver. My sister said to only drink tea. Then suggested teas that have just as much caffeine as a cup of coffee.I let it go because I assumed they were just worried about me. My sister then said \"I can't clean up this hoard you need room have two plates only two people live here.\" I say to her \" what about when I have guest over like my in laws?\" She then says \"use paper plates for them.\" I don't feel comfortable with that.I told her I am not doing that. She then said \"Where are you going to put all this stuff?\" By this point I showed my sister where I put my stuff three times. I have a shelving area that I keep all my plates cups bowls utensils and more. My brother agreed with her even though his wife and him change out plates every season. But they act like just cause I needed help like my lifestyle and choices were bad.They went back to me getting off of steroids, immunosuppresants, and blood thinners. They both tell me it is not good for me and I just need to cut down my clutter, junk food and use homeopathic medicine. I then blew up and said\" Just because I am disabled doesn't mean I can't have a normal amount of dishes. Just cause I am disabled doesn't mean I need room live in nothingness. I am not going to eat like a  dog and I am not going to get off my life saving medicine. You are not my doctor!\"My sister got upset and started crying and I think this is where I might be the AH. My sister left and went to my mom. Her and my brother had told my mom I was unhinged and she called me. She knows what they are like but still asked me to apology and I said\" why should I do that? They don't listen to me and barely helped me. They want me to get off the medicine that is keeping me alive. Why do I have to always be the bigger person?\" Then my mom said \" because I raised you better than that.\" I just hung up and now they are mad. I have not spoken to them in two days and am starting to think I screwed up. So AITA?Update: My mom called me today and apologized. I mentioned to her that it really sucks how she is always taking my little sister's side.Info: Even when we were little i was the good kid. The \"smart\" kid. The caretaker of the family. Because like i said in my post most of my family is able bodied. But not all of us. My mom and i are disabled. But when i got old enough to do things i took the care postion for me and my siblings who lived in the house. Even took care of my dad to a degree. But my sister really did nothing because she was the baby. She caused my mom headaches and was a trouble maker. But my mom and i were not having that. she fixed her life up. She is a good mom and works as a Home health aide. That is why I asked for her help at  first. My older brother is a life coach and has helped people with diabetes. They are good alone but not together because as they got older they have shared alot of crazy conservative views. Including the paranoia about \"big Pharma\"So back to the call. Mom agreed and told me she is going to talk to them. She was just stressed at the time. Which I believe because my dad's health has declined. She asked if she can help me with things. My mom is old and not well. So I said no but thanked her for offering. We made our peace for now. But idk if my siblings are going to listen. My mom tries to understand but it is difficult for her. She was forced pretty young into the home maker role due to her not being able to work. So she is not as educated. My mom is a younger baby boomer for reference.I am looking into services that are covered by my insurance that can help a little with chores and buying groceries.To those who asked at the moment I can't hire a cleaning service to come in because it's expensive. I live in the USA NYC and most services charge alot. My rent is 1500 and my bills come up to alot. The government doesn't help me much and some of my medical needs are not covered by insurance. My husband and i can't afford it with what we get now. My husband has started helping me more. But there is only so much he can do. Because along with helping me, he works part time as a medical assistant and goes to college to be an RN. So until we get a higher amount of money we can only do things in small increments.It has been so difficult. But thank you for listening. If anything comes up I will update again.",

	"body" : "Update (Re-typing it to help with any further questions) I a 35f have a daughter 16f (Abby) and her friend 16f (Zara).I'm looking for advice on what to do. I live in America. About a year ago I took in Zara into my house after her mom kicked her out. Zara's a good kid. She got kicked out because her and her mom would constantly get into screaming matches, we know it's because Zara's mom is a narcissist and blames everyone else. When Zara came into my house I told her I only have two rules. No Drugs, or alcohol.My phone charger has been mysterious appearing in my room and then moving to other parts of the house. My phone takes type C but everyone else used lightning cables. However we all still have devices that use type C, that's why I checked her room. After asking around for over two weeks I haven't found out who did it. Over the weekend I searched Abby and Zara's room, they share a room. I found a fifth of vodka as well as reusable weed pens, and other e-cigarette's on Zara's side of her room.Zara takes classes online and rarely goes out with friends. She's basically house kept at her own will. So I don't know how to go about punishing her. Zara has found other accommodations while living at our house but choses to stay with us. I don't want to kick her out because I know how hard it is to get footing in the door especially with how high living costs have gotten. So maybe if I threaten to do so it wont happen again?So if making threats a horrible thing to do please let me know. I told her my boundaries and she crossed them. I just don't want her to influence my other kids.Edit* So I talked to Zara about three hours after posting this. I told her I'm going to give her three months to clean up her act but if she can't I wont allow her to live with us anymore. Zara told me Abby knows about the weed but not about the vodka, so Abby was not telling me. Zara also told me that Abby never indulged in using any of the drugs. I'm reading all the comments, the good and the bad and I just want to say I appreciate the incite. I will talk to Abby when she gets back from her fathers on Monday.",

	"body" : "I (29F) and my brother (25) went home to our parents house for new year.Growing up I always felt that my brother is my parent's child. Although they were \"vocal\" that they love us both and there were no favorites. I beg to disagree but I understand and don't really give an f growing up.On holidays, my brother would get a new gaming console while I only get a book, or we would get the same phones but he would get an extra money so he could date his gf. When I graduated college, they gave me a car, and I am so happy until a few days later when they also gave my brother a car because they say \"to be fair\" to both of us. When he graduated college he was given an international trip as a gift. Then, I didn't bat an eye but I am keeping score.It does not stop there, when he moved out, they gave him a place as a gift because he \"would have a family and they will live there\", and I had to rent an apartment on my own because they say \"when I marry, my husband will provide me a house.\"Fast forward to this new year, my brother arrived earlier than me with his girlfriend that my parents has just met. I believe they have already bonded while I wasn't there because when I arrived, they seem to be close already.During the dinner, when my parents were giving gifts to both of us, as this is our new year's tradition. My brother was given his gift first, he opened it and it was a brand new latest model phone. When he opened the box, his girlfriend said \"wow that's the color I liked\". I think this was heard by my parents, because instead of giving me my gift, they gave her the gift and said to me \"she'll appreciate it more than you and you are more than capable to buy yourself one\". I thought the gf will not accept it because it was mine and had my name on it but she instead opened it and looked really happy. This made me really upset that I walked out in the middle of dinner and I went home.My family was bombarding me with messages saying how rude I am and that I do not respect them and that I should apologize to them all. Aita?Edit: I forgot to add that I also received several messages from our extended family about apologizing to my parents and brother for being rude. They emphasis our culture of \"close family ties\", and that these are just \"gifts\". Apparently, it should be okay because my parents brought me up well, they paid for my school, and I never had any \"difficulties\" growing up. And that my parents are not \"perfect\".Update: Spoke with my dad today because he went to my house. Well I more of just cried and listened. He apologizes for \"that\" thing that happened on dinner and if I ever felt unfavored \"sometimes\" is because I am a woman and my future husband (I only have a Bf) will be there to take care of me - like provide for our house etc. Whilst my brother has no one to look out for him so they do. He told me that my brother will be the one to provide a shelter for his future family and so on so they support him extra. Didn't really understand much of what he said but his main point is that I should still apologize to my mom and brother. WTF!!! I just asked him politely that he go home so I can think abt it.",

He is an only child and his parents are divorced. I am going to be starting a professional degree in the US fall 2024 while he stays in the UK for his work and we do distance. Since it’s the holiday season right now, we started talking about how we will handle the holidays next year with my restrictive schedule. I only get 2 days off for thanksgiving and 2 weeks off around the holidays in the whole semester.I basically told David that I would spend 1 week with my family for Christmas and then spend the second week with him somewhere on a trip of our choosing (David and I travel together a lot as it’s our favorite thing to do because thanks to Ryan air European flights are cheap).David said to me that wherever we go, he’s going to have to bring his mom because she’s going to be lonely on NYE and they go on a trip together every year for NYE. He said she can’t spend time with her siblings and their family because they go to their in laws side of the family for NYE.I basically told him that I think it’s absolutely unacceptable and that I would not be visiting if we are going somewhere with his mother. I said I understand she might be lonely on one night but I only get 2 weeks off and am choosing to spend that week with him instead of my family. His mom is retired and they could easily postpone their trip to a week in January. I understand it’s not exactly NYE but I don’t have that level of flexibility while they do. It’s not like he is skipping Christmas with his family to spend it with me and mine in the US so I also think it’s offensive to my family that I would ditch them for NYE to spend it with David AND his mom.I don’t dislike his mother she’s fine but I don’t want to spend the only vacation days I have with time to fly transatlantic to be with his mother. The alone time would be important to me and to be frank, a holiday with BFs side of the family is not particularly restful.AITA for not wanting to go on a 2024-2025 NYE trip with just my boyfriend and his mom?Edits:I told him that he could choose between the two weeks and since Christmas tends to be a bigger deal for people he thought new years would week would be better.This isn’t a long standing tradition, him and his mom started this 4 years ago because she doesn’t want to host the rest of their family for both Christmas and new years.I was not brining this up to stir trouble, he’s actually on the trip right now and texted me asked what we’re going to do next year.

I have told him multiple times that it's just not my thing. We enjoy other things together, we play Catan and Dungeons and Dragons together with a group of friends. My breaking point came during Christmas. We're a little short on money, so I gave him a Nintendo Gift card. He gave me an MTG deck. I don't wanna break his heart by telling him how much I hate the gift. I feel like it's a present for him and not for me. He now keeps pushing me to go to the local MTG store so the employees can teach me how to play. I know how to play, I just don't like it.I can't help but feel like maybe I'm the asshole because maybe I'm just not putting in enough effort in engaging in his hobbies, perhaps I could just pretend I like it for him.Edit: I wanna clarify that my boyfriend is in no way controlling or abusive. This is the only aspect of our relationship in which he's ever been this insistent and it's because he loves spending time with me so much he doesn't wanna choose between his special interest and spending time with his girlfriend.Update: Thanks for the suggestions everyone. I decided to have a chat with my boyfriend and let him know that I don't like MTG and have no interest in playing any more, but I enjoy the art and the lore and will go support him when he plays if he wants. He said he understood that I didn't like it before but he perceived I was giving him \"false hope\" by continuing to attempt to get into it. I explained that I was only trying to force myself to like it because I felt it was very important to him. All in all I think I should have never tried to force myself to like it after I told him I didn't like it. Regarding the Christmas gift, he explained his intention was for me to appreciate the art and that he made it because he knows I like LOTR. I explained that from my POV it just looked like he was giving me a deck of a game I have told him I don't wanna play anymore, and that as thoughtful as he thought he was being it just didn't land well. In the end, we agreed that I can give him the cards back and keep the box (it's a really nice box) to store my spell cards from Dungeons and Dragons, and that I don't have to play MTG anymore.

	"title" : "AITA for potentially ruining my boyfriend's relationship with his best friend?",
	"body" : "This is kind of a long story but I'll try to keep it simple.Me (27F) and my bf (28M) have been together for 3 years now and when we first started dating he had a very strong relationship with his best friend (let's call her Sarah). He trusted her so much, always went to her for advice or just chill, and my bf doesn't have too many friends because he's not from this country (he came to live here around 6 years ago) and he's very selective with people he wants in his life too. At this point everything was fine, I've met Sarah a few times and we were not close but I liked her and she is a nice person as far as I know. My bf would even go to her house to party etc and stay there for the night when he was drunk (I'm not the jealous kind of person so this didn't bother me at all). The thing is that Sarah has a sister who lives with her, which I met before knowing they were siblings because we went to the same places and we had some friends in common. She's a nice person too.The problem began a year after when I was talking to my bf and it came up to the conversation that when he first moved in to the country he shared a house with three more roommates (all girls) and one of them was Sarah's sister, then he told me he had a big crush on one of them but that eventually she rejected him but some things happened between them before the rejection (like sexual stuff). This surprised me and even more when I asked who that was and he said it was Sarah's sister. After that I didn't feel comfortable knowing that he still went to their house tons of times, and even slept there on the same bed with both of them when he stayed!!!I tried to not make a big deal out of it, since this happened a long time before we knew each other and we really had a very good relationship but I couldn't help feeling a bit worried every time he told me he was going to their house, so I talked to him about this and he said he didn't mind losing Sarah sister's friendship because he didn't feel anything for her anymore and he wanted to be with me so he cut that relationship off. He stopped going to their house too much and tried to just meet with Sarah when her sister was not around but this eventually came up between them and he had to tell Sarah all that happened between him and his sister (which Sarah didn't know). After that Sarah started to take some distance from him and eventually stopped talking to him at all.It's been a while but sometimes my bf tells me he misses his best friend, and I can't help feel guilty because this would've never happened if I kept it to myself.AITA for telling him how I felt and kind of ruined his frienship?EDIT: Some ppl are telling me I'm the AH for persuading him into cutting off the relationship with Sarah's sister. Well, I didn't. I even told him that it was not necessary to stop hanging with them, I just asked him not to stay at night if possible, that I could go pick him up if he didn't feel like he could drive and he came up with cutting off the relationship with the sister.Ps. Some other ppl say I did this cuz I was insecure that he liked her. My bf has another girl bestie that he liked in the past, nothing happened at all between them and I'm totally fine with that relationship, I like her, we get along well and hang out sometimes too. What made me insecure was that something actually happened between him and Sarah's sister, not that he liked her before.",

We decided that right after Christmas would be the perfect time, because the weather would be good and neither of us would have to worry about taking time off work. While we were planning the rest of the logistics, he mentioned to me that his best friend, James, had previously expressed interest in doing the same trip, and that it might be fun to have a few more people come. I agreed and so we reached out to a few of our friends who we thought would be interested. There ended up being 6 people that joined including a mix of his friends, my friends, and mutual friends. Everyone who went had met each other before and got along well, so we were all excited for the trip.Now one of my friends, Kate, also would have enjoyed this sort of thing. However, she used to date James, and I thought that having both of them accompany us would make it a bit awkward and uncomfortable for everyone else, so I didn't invite her or tell her about it. I figured we could do a similar girls trip later down the track instead.We returned a couple days ago and had a really good time. Everything went smoothly and everyone enjoyed themselves. I reached out to Kate today and asked to meet up with her for a coffee, where I planned on putting forward the idea of our girl's trip. She told me that she had no interest in spending any time with me, and I made it very clear that I would rather hang out with her ex than go out with her. She found out about the trip somehow (i'm not sure who through, none of us posted anything on sm) and said that now that I've chosen her ex over her she sees no need to continue her friendship with me.We've known each other since the start of high school, and her and James did not have a messy breakup or anything, no infedility or abuse or anything like that, just massive clash of personalities. And as long as James and my boyfriend are still friends he will always be a part of my life. I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong here or not?

I understand his hunting and have never said anything negative about it, but I have always refused to eat what he killed. I am the one who cooks in our marriage and have told him time and time again if he wants to eat his deer meat, he has to make it himself.We have been going through a rough time with other issues, me feeling alone and like he doesn't care about me as much as his friends and hobbies, and feeling like a roommate who takes care of the house and bills.Well December 23rd is supposed to be OUR Christmas day even though we don't exchange gifts. He had planned to go hunting that morning and I argued that if it was our day and we couldn't go see my family early than he should be home. After some back and forth he cancelled hunting and said he was already going to make me dinner. I was so excited because I always make dinner and he never cooks for me. He then tells me he's going to make deer roast. Again, I don't eat deer. I asked him if he was going to get me beef and he went off on me in front of people about how we talked about this and he's trying to be better and wants to start cooking more and is proud of his hunting and wants to provide. I explained again how I felt about eating deer and it fell on deaf ears. He did not care. He made the deer roast and when I didn't want to eat it he got defensive and upset and blamed me for not giving him praise for trying.I feel like if I were trying to make our relationship better I would value my spouse's opinions and beliefs and make something they'd like. So AITA for not eating my husband's cooking.Edited to add I don’t like venison for multiple reasons. I don’t like the taste, it’s chewy and gamey, and it’s mentally hard for me to overcome. I source my other meats and know where they come from but the main thing Is I don’t like venison.Edited one more time: he plays men’s league baseball and I go to every game, he golfs with his buddies, plays indoor soccer, and plays video games.

If he enjoyed the class, no matter the results, I would never have asked the community. I just don’t know what’s worse: leaving the coach or leaving the frustration.The sport is boxing. No sparring. Just bag work or partner work with mitts and gloves. It’s good for both of us. We’re both traumatized and suffering. It breaks my heart to see him like this during the class but he’s like this with everything that’s frustrating even before his dad left. He been going to a counselor for a year and has seen a dr over his frustration management. I just worry that the frustration with his dad and boxing might be affecting his mental health.I also want to thank everyone who has posted support for me as a newly single mother. The whole family, me and my two boys are just trying to do the best we can. Some of the posters have made it to be that I’m a heartless mother for taking him out of something that is a sport. My concern is that he was being overwhelmed, and his life is plenty overwhelming as it is. I have done nothing but support that little boy his whole life. He’s passionate about gardening so he has 10 planters, he plays trumpet, and fixes old computers that I’ve had donated from our neighborhood. He bbqs a mean set of baby back ribs and so I got him a charcoal bbq for Christmas and he loves it. He’s been able to try anything he wants and has been going to a counselor for about a year. His mental health is the utmost importance to me.Another edit. The results he was looking for was what the coach promised. “They’re gonna get shredded.” It was both my boys and me at first. The older boy dropped because he wasn’t seeing that. Now, he has gotten stronger, but shredded? No.",

Sometimes this is fine, but it also causes issues.A mundane issue is food. I never know how much to buy for the week because I could be feeding 3/5 or 6/8. Many times, I've had no snacks to give the younger boys because the teens had stopped by unannounced or been in the middle of cooking dinner when one of them shows up. Other times they plan to visit and bail last minute and I'll ending up having to waste food.The unannounced visits also cause disruption to the younger boy’s routine. Sometimes it's just stupid stuff like the boys being kept up by their older siblings or being over excited when they show up before bedtime. The issue happens the other way round and they get disappointed when the teens flake.I've previously brought up my dislike for the unscheduled visits to my bf but he doesn’t see the issue and blows me off.However, we recently got into a big fight about it. All bf's kids were supposed to be at their moms for Christmas. The youngest 5 were scheduled to be with us from the 26th.My parent, 2 sisters, BIL, and 2 nieces stayed with us from the 22nd to the morning of the 26th. This allowed for my family to have space in the house as we only had one kid. My parents are also not the biggest fan of my bf and don't like the number of kids he has so I try to schedule their visits when they aren't around.However, on the 23rd the 17 y/o storms into our home after a fight with his stepdad and says he's spending Christmas with us. I tell him he has to sleep on the couch because my parents are in his room, and he throws a hissy fit and basically sulked for the next few days. On the 24th 14 y/o called his dad and also wanted to spend Christmas with us.I didn't want him to because we didn't have enough food/space, and I had originally planned a seperate Christmas for bf's kids on the 26th. We argued for a while, but BF went to pick up his son anyway.It caused issues like I knew it would. We ran out of food and there was lots of tension between my mom and 17 y/o. He kept going into his room to get stuff and wanting to play on his computer. She told him off multiple times for being rude.This morning I was complaining to my bf about how they made Christmas so stressful for me and that he needed to get the kids to schedule their visits. He told me I'm being an asshole who just didn't want his kids around for Christmas. I disagreed as it's a year-round issue.",

	"title" : "AITA for telling my stepmom about my dad's lies and letting her know the truth?",
	"body" : "So my dad, my stepmom and me (16M) have been in family therapy for around 3 months now. It started out because my stepmom started to have some concerns about our family she wanted addressed. Our last session before Christmas a few things were brought up and asked and I decided to be honest. I admitted that my dad had lied to my stepmom about me asking him if she would adopt me and be my mom. This happened when I was 7. The second thing is admitting I never wanted to be adopted and I wish I hadn't been adopted back then and if the choice were given to me today I would say no.I was asked some questions by the therapist, stuff we had discussed a little prior in a solo session, and I was truthful. That while I have love for my stepmom I do not love her the way a kid loves their mom or dad or how I love my mom. I also admitted that it would feel weird to me to live with her if dad were gone and I have other family members (paternal grandparents and maternal grandpa) who would be my choice. I admitted that I kept quiet because my dad basically told me what was happening and he made it clear he would not tolerate me hurting or disrespecting my stepmom by telling her I didn't want her. I also said it frustrated me sometimes to know the adoption isn't reversable because that's something I would do.My stepmom was furious at my dad. She admitted she had been told by my dad that I went to him privately about wanting to be adopted and how much I loved her. She was also led to believe I didn't remember my mom at all and really felt nothing for her... I was 5 when my mom died so my memories are not great but I have some. She also talked about how dad told her that I was worried about being replaced when they had kids and she went out of her way to be extra attentive and loving because she hated that I felt that way. But I confirmed I had never felt that way. I admitted I felt kinda bad before she had kids because the kid she loves as her own and claims as her own didn't think of her as his mom and would never return that love back in the way she deserved. I admitted it was a relief when she had kids of her own.My dad is furious at me because things have been tense and there were a lot of very high emotions all through Christmas. He told me I had destroyed the woman who adopted me and gave me all her love and care and I had destroyed his second marriage. He also said I destroyed it all for some fuzzy memories of my mom and it's not what she would have wanted. I asked him if he really knew that. Then he went off about my grandpa and said he had no right to tell me that my mom had been terrified of being replaced and that she probably wouldn't have wanted me to be adopted or call another woman mom. I told him it was the first time I heard about that (truth, grandpa never said shit to me about it). My dad told me so I just decided to shit all over my stepmom and his marriage for nothing.AITA?",

Now I don’t shower daily either (especially in the winter, it’s not good for my skin), so this isn’t me being super-judgmental, but I’m talking about regularly going 4+ days without a shower. Hey, whatever. If we aren’t going anywhere, I’m not even going to judge that very harshly because with my office closed this week I’ve been on vacation and have definitely gotten a little gross myself.For a while now I’ve generally been able to remind her to shower or ask her and that gets the hint across that: yo, you need to shower. But I’ve been getting more and more pushback. Earlier tonight the fight we had happened because we’re leaving town to drive and go see her grandparents and we’re going to be in the car for like 5 hours. So I asked if she was showering tonight or in the morning, trying to plan because I def. need a shower too, and she said she wasn’t planning on one. It’s been, I believe (I don’t keep a calendar) since Tuesday when she showered last. Maybe Monday. I kinda lost it, and said I shouldn’t have to tell her that going 4-5 days without a shower when we’re going out wasn’t ok. She was instantly mad that I brought it up at all and stormed off to bed. I followed up with a text that basically said ‘I couldn’t believe she was throwing a tantrum because I told her she shouldn’t go 4 days without a shower, and that while I started off trying to be gentle about it, she needed to take the hint, and that continuing to refuse to shower after someone says: ‘hey I can smell you’ is acting like a child. I’ve watched countless parents have this fight with (usually) their sons, it seemed like an apt comparison.She’s upset that was “disrespectful” and that I “called her a child” (I said acting like one). I said I was upset that I had to remind a grown adult to do basic grooming tasks. So Reddit, AITA? I just don’t want to ride in a stinky car for hours on end and then go hang out with folks while my GF has actual cartoon smell lines coming off of her.edit: before anyone gets off on a “it’s depression” tangent. Yeah, no shit. She’s been on meds for that and another issue for a while, and while I’ve had a fuck-ton of conversations with her about continuing to speak with her doc about which ones and their dosage because it seems to me that it’s not a problem that is currently under control, that has been a COMPLETE non-starter. Won’t even be considered. I do get it, the arguably bigger mental health issue she has IS well maintained currently, so I get that she’s scared to rock the boat, but fuck…",

	"body" : "This might be a long post, there is quite some backstory.My parents separated when i was 14 years old. My father Bob (69) has a wife/girlfriend named Julie (66), they are not married and have been together for about 15 years in a long distance relationship.  My dad used to visit Julie on the weekends while he was still working and live there for most of the week after he stopped working. They bought an apartment together close to me(35) about 4 months ago.They invited the family to a Christmas dinner on the 26th, a tradition in my family that my father invites us on this day. Her kids were not there. I have two full siblings and one half sibling on my mother's side and all were invited along with our kids and significant others.Julie is sensitive to strong smells according to my dad so he warns the whole family to not wear any strong cologne or deodorant when we come. I think this is a little bit weird but fine i usually don't wear any cologne anyway and i skipped my deodorant.I dragged my daughter (4) on a slow sled over to their apartment about 15 minutes away from mine. When i get there i sit down in a sofa that was from her old apartment originally.  They brought one sofa each from their old places. Her sofa has a sheet on it, presumably so no perfume smells stick to it. Anyway she asks me to move to my dad's old sofa because according to her there is a strong smell coming from my Christmas sweater which was washed with a detergent with a smell (like 95% of all people use).I was surprised there was any smell coming off of me because i had been careful not using any cologne or deodorant but i moved to the other sofa. Then she starts reading a book for my daughter in her old sofa and i asked her if my daughter could stay there with her because her clothes had been washed with the same detergent. She said yes because she can't smell as much from her.I got pretty angry at that point and tried to tell her i thought it was rude inviting people over with ridiculous terms. Then she complained i was not being considerate of her perfume allergy which i honestly don't think she has, have never seen her have any allergic symptoms. I have allergies and it's pretty obvious when i have symptoms. I thought she was behaving like a victim while having absurd terms for everyone visiting and i lost it. I told her and my father who was agreeing with her that i would not partake in this crazy situation and left with my daughter and my sister who was the only other person there agreed with me and left with us.I have been feeling pretty pissed off for a couple of days about this whole situation. My whole family aside from my dad thinks Julie is crazy. I'm upset with my dad for buying in to her crazy beliefs and worried that he has lost his common sense.AITA?AWTA? Are we the assholes?

Basically we were all in the living room watching a movie and towards the end of it my parents suggested that me and Lynn do a little baking competition and the winner would get 40$. (it’s silly I know but whatever) So me and Lynn agreed and my parents left to go visit my aunt.(They were planning on going there anyway)Like I said before me and Lynn agreed and started to bake. Like I said I love to bake so I went for something simple and made blueberry muffins, and my sister made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Don’t get me wrong there’s nothing wrong with a sandwich but I don’t really think she even tried. The sandwich was plain white bread with jelly and peanut butter on it.Anyways my parents came home about 1.5 hours later and ate what we both made. Well they finished eating and ended up choosing Lynn. I know it’s probably dramatic but I got a little upset because she didn’t even bake anything. It took her a good 15 miniutes and I don’t think she tried that much.I told my parents how I felt and they said that it was just a little game and I was overreacting, so now I feel bad and I’m thinking that I should’ve just kept my mouth shut.

Over the years, we have gotten plenty of perks as a result of this like big checks at Bdays and Christmas, nice dinners, etc. but it’s not excessive and my parents were more or less on their own with money when raising my sister and I. My undergraduate education was split between my parents paying the upfront cost and me being on the hook for loans. I recognize my privilege growing up around wealthy family and am in no way trying to be entitled.My sister is a few years older than me and went to grad school 5 or 6 years ago at the sponsorship of my grandparents. They had put out a notice that any grandchildren who wanted to go to graduate school should reach out to them and they would help out with the finances. This turned into them paying the entire tuition for my sister, and then my cousin followed suit a few years later. Neither of them paid a dime. I graduated undergrad 2 years ago and knew I wanted to work for a few years before going back to school once I knew for sure what I wanted to do.This year at Christmas, I visited home and had a private meeting with my grandparents where I pitched what I wanted to go to school for and asked if they could help out. They told me they were not able to help me. I tried to get an understanding of why not (it was nothing to do with this being a BS degree or anything) but didn’t get much of an answer. Since my sister and cousin got full rides and I couldn’t get anything, my feelings were really hurt. I’m not trying to be entitled but I do feel like it’s unfair.

I have a fairly expensive and rare older car, that I completely restored myself..

	"body" : "TLDR at the end. I’ve never been on great terms with my sister Becky’s second husband, Bill. He has an inflated ego and he will talk about his time as a Marine as if he was a war hero, when in reality he had a paper pushing job stateside, had issues with authority, and was a failure to adapt.Normally my mom hosts Christmas. Becky and Bill stay with her from out of state. Due to circumstances, mom is living with me and I hosted Christmas. I told Becky and Bill they should stay in a hotel. Bill was adamant that if they couldn’t stay with us then they couldn’t afford to come to Christmas. I said they can camp in the living room.When they arrived Bill said he needs a bedroom. He was insistent that it’s proper for kids to give up their room. I said no. Without my knowledge he convinced my kids it would be fun to camp with the cousins in the living room. Fine, I wasn’t going to make an issue of it.On the 24th we hosted Christmas Eve. I have a brother, Michael who was injured by an IED in Afghanistan. He has a brain injury. Michael isn’t a fan of Bill. During one of the first times they met, Bill went off on how gays serving openly was “an insult to veterans like us.” My brother asked why, Bill gave some reason I don’t recall, then my brother simply said “I’m gay.” Bill quickly changed his opinion in favor.Since that conversation Bill has been extra goofy around my brother, I believe in an attempt to smooth things over. One of Bill’s favorite things to do is to try distracting Michael’s service dog. He will always say he’s joking, that he’s testing how well trained the dog is, keeping the dog on her toes, etc. Bill claims only fellow veterans will understand. This visit was no different. As usual, Bill ignored Michael and his husband asking him to stop. I asked Bill to take something seriously for once, Michael could get hurt.Bill proceeded to imitate Michael’s stutter, dramatically exclaiming “oh no, I’m f-f-f-faling!” and pretended like he was tripping and getting hurt. It was cartoonish. It royally pissed me off. I yelled at him to get the fuck out of my house.Soon the entire family was packing to leave. I made it clear that only Bill wasn’t welcome, Becky and the kids could stay. Becky’s stance was she’s an extension of Bill and where he isn’t welcome she isn’t either. Mom wanted us to reconsider and let Bill back in, for the kids sake. I said again the kids and Becky can stay, go convince them to stay without Bill. Mom said she’s disappointed with me and gave them money for a hotel. She hasn’t spoken with me since the 24th.TLDR. Brother-in-law, Bill, and my sister Becky and her kids were staying at my place for Christmas. After a history of issues with Bill I snapped when he began mocking my disabled brother. I kicked Bill out from my home. Becky and the kids left with him. My mother is upset with me for not being able to look past Bill for the sake of Becky and the kids. For clarity, only Bill was not welcome.Comments. Sorry I have to add information this way because my comments were removed for not having 100 comment karma.Bill did not receive a dishonorable discharge. He received a general discharge. He wanted to re-enlist but from what I'm aware of he was essentially administratively barred from it. He tried to join the police academy but couldn't pass the psych exam.About my mom and sister...Not claiming my sister is free from all blame here, but in her defense our father was a real piece of work. It really messed all of us up. Her first husband was an abusive pig who landed himself in prison. So for what it's worth, Bill is moderately better than the first guy, and Bill isn't all that great. I have more sympathy for her and why she either feels she needs to put up with this behavior or otherwise can't fully see the issues with it. I don't want to cut Becky off because if she wakes up to it I want her to have somewhere safe to go.My mom is here temporarily while her home is being fixed from severe storm damage. My little brother has always been her scapegoat. I've always been the one to keep the peace between them. It's complicated, but my tolerance for her is more than my tolerance for Bill.",

Thing 1 is 4 y/o, and Thing 2 is 2 y/o.Recently, we've been trying to train Thing 1's service dog, so he can be certified to accompany her into places when we have outings. Today, my stepmom, Thing 1, Thing 2, and I decided to head to the shops while Dad was at work. We stopped at the local supermarket to pick up some cat food and other necessities.We arrived, had a lovely shopping experience, and went to the tills to checkout. Thing 1 and her dog were in the basket of the trolley, and Thing 2 was sitting in the children's seat. My stepmom paid for her things, and then I began paying for my stuff. As I did so, I watched as Stepmom took Thing 1 and her dog put of the cart, as they both had become restless for waiting so long.Almost immediately after they were taken out, the dog made a mess in the floor, which Stepmom was happy to clean up with towels and spray given by the cashier. By this time, Thing 2 started in on a crying fit. I quickly finished the transaction, and grabbed the dog, made sure he didn't make any further messes, and placed him back in the trolley. I went to return Thing 1 to the basket as well, only to realize she was nowhere to be seen. We quickly split up to search for her.Five minutes, a missing child announcement, and a couple heart attacks later, we found her next to the cookie display. We called off the search the employees started, and we made our way out of the store. The rest of the outing went off without a hitch, and we all returned home safely.All was fine, and no words were had about the trip until my dad returned from work. My stepmom told him about the scare that Thing 1 gave us today, and he proceeded to lay into me about how irresponsible I am and how I should've been paying better attention.My stepmom isn't upset with me in the slightest, but what my father said made me really rethink the situation.

We’ll call her Ashley) was supposed to show up with her husband and 2 kids with a specially prepared birthday cake.  Ashley has been decorating detailed specialized cakes for about 10 years now.  She committed to bringing to cake as well as going to go get dinner, but canceled last minute because it “Didn’t fit in her schedule.”  This hurt my sister’s feelings, so I went and bought Bundt Cakes for her with birthday candles to cheer her up.  Ashley sent her mother to our house to deliver the cake while we were out.  After we finished eating my other sister (19) had made a post with a picture of my sister on her Facebook wishing her a Happy Birthday.  Ashley made a comment on the post stating “Happy Birthday, I love you, but you’ll regret cutting your hair.  Your parents are ridiculous for letting you do something so stupid.”In my eyes this comment was completely uncalled for and rude to say to a teen on her birthday.  There should never be a “but” after “I love you”.  We left the restaurant and on the way home I responded to this mean girl hate comment saying “Keep your negative, rude comments of my sister’s appearance to your damn self instead of commenting them on Facebook.  Say Happy Birthday and move the fuck on.”  When we got home I tried tell my mom about what I had said in response to her comment and Stepdad interjected, loudly disagreeing with my involvement in the problem and telling me that it’s “Not my place to say anything.”  I responded that “As her big brother it is my place to defend her from anyone in or out of this family from disrespecting her and commenting on her appearance.”  I later received a message from Ashley saying “Our relationship is completely over, until you apologize so fuck you. You do not disrespect me, (sister’s name spelt incorrectly) is old enough to call me and say that hurt her feelings. You just have really big Facebook balls.  Peace Out!” I had no way of responding to the message as she blocked me from responding.So, am I the asshole for defending my teenage sister from a grown woman leaving a rude comment of her appearance?I feel personally that no matter who says anything rude about my sister I’m going to stand up for her and speak my mind.  And there was no relationship with Ashley to begin with, so nothing was lost here.  Stepdad is still mad and thinks I crossed the line for standing up to her.",

	"title" : "AITA for not shoveling my neighbors driveway and refusing to help them get their car unstuck after they told me I should be nicer?",
	"body" : "I (27M) live in a duplex with my fiance'. The duplex has a single driveway that I share with my neighbors, but they both park their cars in the driveway even though both houses have a garage. I don't hate my neighbors, we both just do our own thing, but I've attempted before to try and be nice and neighborly to them. I've invited them to cookouts, offered help with yardwork, brought them their packages that were left at my door, etc. And nothing I do seems to be enough to get even a 'thank you' out of them.We've gotten a lot of snow during the cold snap that's affecting half of the U.S. right now. One day, after we had a big snowstorm, I got done shoveling my side of the driveway and I decided to be nice and shovel and salt their side, too. I again didn't get a thank you, even though I waved at them when I saw them getting home.Then, a day later, we had another big snowstorm. I didn't have time before I had to get to work, so I made plans to shovel when I got home. When I got home, the neighbor's side of the driveway was cleared while mine was a literal mound of powder and ice. I also noticed a snowblower left outside right in front of their garage. I admittedly got a little mad but didn't confront them about it. I'd use one too if I had it, but to leave my side a complete mound that I had to shovel by hand, most of it frozen from the negative weather, and I felt like I could almost hear them laughing at me.We had yet another snowstorm this morning, but today was my day off and so before my fiance' had to go to work herself, I shoveled/froze my ass off. I only did my side of the driveway. After an hour, I heard a knock at my door. It was the neighbors, both of them looking annoyed and cold. The guy asked if I could help them, as the furthest car down the driveway was stuck, so neither of them could leave (the other car was parked in front of that one). I thought about just laughing and shutting the door, but I just went out and got ready to shovel yet again.When I stepped out, the guy started berating me, asking why I didn't do their side of the driveway when I was out earlier. The woman, who was in the car, started yelling at me that it was my fault that he was going to be late for work because I could've cleared the snow behind them, but I chose not to. So I brought up the aforementioned snowblower, but the guy said it was 'out of the question' and stated he didn't have enough gas for it or the money to get it because of the high price. I asked if that was the case, I literally have a full gas tank in my garage he could use, but the guy said there was no time and I just had to 'be nicer'.So I got my shovel out of the garage, gave it to the guy, then went back inside. They were both yelling at me even after I went in, and later on, I found my shovel in the yard. They did get their car out eventually.AITA?",

Every week for the last couple years we have been married, I grocery shop on Sunday so that I can cook and prep meals for the week as I am also in charge of meal planning for the household.This week, we were sitting on the coach watching the football game and I asked him if he would grocery shop for me and he asked me why. I said because I was tired. His response was “go tomorrow” and I can’t because of work and gym, so by the time I get home and cook, it would be after 9:00 pm. He then countered with - we can eat out this week instead of groceries. I don’t want to eat out because it is very expensive. I asked him “Why can’t you go for me this week since I go every other time?”He flew off the handle! He said that “Because you asked me this question, I will NEVER go grocery shop in the future. Why is it my job to grocery shop when you are too tired? I said I will order food for the week. How could you even ask me this question?”I explained to him that while this chore is usually my responsibility, I am asking him to help me. I reminded him that we are partners. When he is tired and asks me to help him with something, I do it without question. I am simply asking for his help this week.He then countered with “From now on then, I will buy only my groceries and you will buy yours. You will never have to buy or cook for me again.” I explained to him that “I don’t mind doing the groceries and cooking, but today I am more tired than normal and that if one of us doesn’t then we won’t have food for the week. It’s important that we eat.” All he did was kiss his lips.I stand up and put my shoes on to go to the store. (He had given me his card early this morning before church so that I could go later. He pays for all the groceries while I handle some of the other bills.) He says “Give me my card. You can stay here. I will order us food this week, and if you want to eat something else then you can go buy it.”So am I the asshole?UPDATE: A lot of people are asking if this is normal - no, he has never had such a strong reaction like this before.

	"body" : "I (28M) am planning on moving out of a house that me and some roommates agreed to lease.To preface, I lived at this house for 4 years, and in the first 2 years I had one set of roommates. All of these roommates left and that left me with the house and I could invite some people to become roommates. So I gathered some new roommates to help me lease the house and reduce the cost of living. We were a nice bunch chilling at the house and there weren't that many issues.2 years pass by and some \"changes\" have occurred around the house. A roommate started inviting her cousin over and started to become a \"tenant.\" She would occasionally come by the house on random days, be it Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and even Sunday and start having karaoke nights or just drink the night away until like 3AM. I have work from Monday through Friday at 5AM. This \"tenant\" and the others would tend to get rowdy later in the day and cause a lot of noise to the point where I can't sleep at night. As a person who has to work early in the morning, I would ask nicely to keep the noise levels down to a minimum. They would refuse to listen and continue their activities at the same noise level, if not louder.This has been a recurring event for about 6 months and the situation hasn't gotten any better. I would always ask these roommates to keep the noise levels down whenever they have these gatherings, but to no avail. I am outnumbered in this situation because every roommate is joining in on these activities and I'm the only one who wants to have peace and quiet.So, being as there is no longer a compromise with these tenants, I have decided to move out of the premises. I gave my landlord a written notice and she has accepted it. What I did not know is that the landlord is no longer making the lease valid after I move out, so now everyone is getting evicted. This was something beyond my control and I did not know that she was essentially going to remove the house off the renting market and evict all of the tenants.The roommates find out about this and they are absolutely furious. They are saying that I am the asshole for leaving the house and basically making them \"homeless\". I can hear them from my room flaming me for not asking what I asked for (even though I did) and not forewarning them that I am moving out, even though the lease terms explicitly state that a 30 days written notice is required.So, AITA?",

We both have a dry sense of humour, think the same things at the same time, know what each of us are going to say next before we say it. Best of all, he has a heart of gold & is so thoughtful.Jane seems to go off in these moods & fall out with me. I always apologised & we made up. Dave didn’t understand why I apologised if I hadn’t done anything. He was really the one to shine a light on this behaviour that I had always gone along with, & I’d never really noticed it before.When with Dave, I guess Jane noticed a difference in me and constantly said I was under the thumb. I wasn’t, I was just more confident.We’ve done ok, coming from really poor backgrounds, minimum wage jobs & living in box rooms at our parents’ homes, to buying our first home together, now second. It’s around this time the “you’re stuck up & think you’re better than everyone” comments started coming in from Jane, making me feel bad about myself. Even now I still feel like I’m failing. But Dave always reminded me ‘look how well you’ve done, I’m so proud of you’, &put a smile back on my face.I’m not alone, Jane consistently falls out with my mother, dad, other sister, sometimes daughter, &other half. Jane has 2 children, (20F) & (5) When Janes fallen out with anyone in the past, she stopped all contact with them & the children. My family swallowed their pride & apologised to “all get along” & be able to see them.However, with us apologising over nothing we’ve done, I feel like it’s now set that Jane is always right, everyone else is wrong, & everyone must automatically apologise to Jane.Now to 20F birthday over a year ago. Apparently I made a comment about her that she got mad at (I think I actually just agreed with what she said as the restaurant was loud)- she fell out with me, but I said sorry -which she accepted. So I thought we were cool.Its now close to Xmas & I’d tried to call Jane, ask her plans. I got nothing. A week before Xmas, I was at a comedy gig, & posted online. At the break I went to the toilets & checked my phone. Message from Jane. She said her &the children wanted nothing to do with me. I came back & Dave asked what was wrong, he could see I was upset. I told him, he wasn’t happy. It looked like Jane had seen where I was &chose to attack me &ruin our night. I believe an apology is owed to both Dave & I for that night.I’ve seen her a couple of times with the family. She is sure not to interact with me, even when I try.My family say I should apologise, try & make up, but for the first time in my life, I think I have to stand my ground. They say “you can’t not invite your own sister”. She’s apparently told them “if I don’t get an invite, that’s IT.” I feel like she doesn’t deserve an invite & would cause a scene. It’s a day for Dave & I.I’d love to be close again, but I want to be respected too. I’m an adult now, not a pushover.AITA?",

It’s a civil / surface level relationship and I don’t mind it!My sister, however, doesn’t put any more effort into the relationship than I do, but I think she has unrealistic expectations of our relationship. My sister doesn’t put effort into our relationship on a regular basis, but during times of need, she expects me to flip a switch and play sister for her at her convenience.

Two days after the wedding, I couldn’t even get a text back from her. This is just how things go between us. She feels very entitled to a one-sided relationship with me at her discretion, however, I really don’t care to participate in that.A year ago, she reached out to me to tell me she miscarried via text.

We apologized & said we would do better next time.Next year, I'm graduating high school and my immediate family and I agree to pool our funds and invite my mom's side of the family over for my graduation. This time we would stage them in a nice 4 star hotel, everyone who wanted their own rooms got one, everyone else shared. They then proceeded to complain that we didn't think they were worth a 5 star hotel, and secretly moved to a 5 star after we already paid for lodging. They then complained they lost money because we're too selfish to give them a nice stay.Next year my cousin graduated, we attempted to make plans to figure out the lodging but were ignored. We were simply given a time/ date for the graduation. My immediate family & I get a hotel in Florida. My mom's family still ignores us when we reach out.

I never thought I’d be posting here, but here goes . . .So, some BG: I come from a family that has always struggled financially. We’ve never had much, and my parents worked hard to make ends meet. They’ve always emphasized the importance of education, and it was drilled into my head that getting a college degree is the key to a better life.Fast forward to the present: I am the first person in my family to attend college, and I recently graduated with honors. I landed a great job with a decent salary, which has finally allowed me to have some financial stability.Here’s where the conflict arises, though. My little brother (20F) dropped out of HS a few years ago, and has been struggling to find his way ever since. He’s been working odd jobs, but hasn’t found anything stable.He recently approached me, asking for help to get back on his feet.Initially, I felt sympathetic and wanted to support him. I offered to help him enroll in a GED program, pay for the classes, and even help him find a job once he’s done. But, here’s the thing — he refused. He told me that he doesn‘t want to go back to school/work a regular job because he believes it’s “not his thing”.Instead, he asked if I could lend him a significant amount of money to pursue his dream of becoming a social media influencer. He wants to travel, create content, and make a living out of it. Now, I understand that social media can be a legitimate career for some people, but it’s risky, and success is far from guaranteed.Here’s where I may be the AH. I told him that I’m not comfortable giving him such a large sum of money for an uncertain endeavor. I explained that I worked hard to get where I am, and I don’t want to jeopardize my financial stability by making a risky investment. I suggested he explore more realistic options, like getting his GED/finding a stable job, but he got upset with me.He accused me of being selfish, unsupportive, and not understanding his dreams. He said that “family should always be there for each other” and “help in times of need”. Now, I feel guilty, but also like I’m being taken advantage of.So, Reddit; AITA?",

	"body" : "My roommate and I both have our names on our lease that was renewed back in Oct 2023 which ends on Nov 2024. We made an agreement with each other that we would each be paying for half of the total monthly rent, and this agreement has been in place since before the lease renewal.At the end of December 2023 he told me he found a better opportunity and would be moving out in January.He told me that if we paid $[x] between the two of us, we could buy out of the lease completely and it would count for our rent payments for 2 months after that (we need a 2 months written notice to terminate the lease.) If that was the case, I told him I wouldn't mind paying for half of it because it would be cheaper for both of us in the long run - mutually beneficial.However, sensing this was total B.S. I spoke with my property manager who clarified that the $[x] is a separate charge and we are still rent responsible for the following 2 months after that notice is given (so March 31st if we gave our notice before the 31st of this month). That made more sense. I do not feel comfortable paying half of the termination fee out of my own pocket simply so he can move out while I stay here.When I expressed to him that I would not pay half of the $[x] just so he can leave, I was told by him that we will \"cross this bridge when we get there.\"He decided yesterday that he would \"help me\" with rent until the end of February. \"Help me...\" meaning that he shows no intention of paying his part of the rent after that point. Keep in mind: his name is still on the lease agreement. If he chooses to terminate the lease sometime in February if a roommate isn't found, our 2-month notice is pushed back to April 31st and we are both still rent responsible until then. That's 2 full months of rent that he has no intention of paying.I am unable to pay the entire rent on my own which means that he will have the face the consequences just as much as I would if he refuses to pay his half. This also means that even though he is searching for a roommate, I am in search of a roommate myself as well simply out of fear and obligation. I do not feel like I should be responsible for not finding a roommate if a roommate is not found. I also recognize that since I cannot pay the rent fully on my own, we will both be legally responsible when he decides to stop paying.So, I am kindly asking if AITA forA) Alerting him that I will not be accepting responsibility for paying the possible termination fee if it was his choice to leave in the first placeB) Letting him know that I will not be accepting responsibility for finding a roommate to fill the spot that he is leaving behind and letting him know that said responsibility is his own",

Because of this, any outdoor events in temps of 33°c + I avoid and don't attend.My brother wants a beach wedding, ceremony in the middle of the sand, no shade, no cover, no fans, stinking hot and I'm assuming lots of sweaty makeup and sunburn. I respect his wishes but told him I will not attend, I really don't want to faint at his wedding.

	"body" : "It’s been awhile but I was thinking about my last post and thought i’d make an update. It’s kind of a mess& I can’t make it flow like a story so I’m gonna do bullet points.the new year marked the 1 year anniversary of my moms death. I’ve been feeling more stable the last few months but now I feel like I’m right back where I started. I started seeing a counselor this summer but idk if she helps that muchAna & Eve went quiet about it but things still felt tense so I wasn’t seeing much of my dad or brother & I felt like I was ready to try to fix things. Eves birthday was in September. I thought the suggestions from my first post were really good so I went through my mother’s paintings and journals and had a coffee table type book made with 20 prints I thought she’d appreciate most and their corresponding entries. And it was so fucking hard, I wasn’t ready to go so in depth but I thought it would be worth it. Eve seemed.. receptive but underwhelmed (? I don’t know what words I want.) but she said thank you and was looking through it and then after a few minutes, Ana said “all that time for some prints?” and then Eve said “it’s not the same”. I didn’t want to fight but I didn’t want to cry either so I just left right then. I wanted to rip it out of her hands but I didn’t. My dad called me and apologized but I told him I didn’t want to go back home & see Ana or Eve for awhileThe biggest thing that changed is that Ana’s mom passed just after Thanksgiving. She was sick for years so it was sad but not shocking but I think Ana’s whole perspective shifted. She sincerely apologized to me a few days after the funeral and I don’t think my trust in her is restored yet but it’s a big step and I told her that I forgave her so things are better between us. Eve and I have barely spoken since her birthday and she ignored me before the funeral when i told her i was sorry she lost her grandma. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want things ruined forever but I want an apology and idk if I’m ever going to get one. I don’t want to put work in if she’s going to ignore me. She got an apartment with friends and she’s moving in soon so I’ll be able to visit without awkwardness now but I’m not happy with how things are still.My lease ended 9/30 and I thought maybe I’d move into my mom’s house. But I couldn’t do it. I’ve been at an Airbnb and telling myself that I had to move in after the one year because Im spending WAY too much on this place and if I sign another lease, I’m just letting it sit there for another year…. Im paid through at the Airbnb another week but then I’m going to have to leave. I talked to my best friend and she’s going to sublet her apartment and stay with me for a while so I’m not alone. I’ll feel better with her there but I still don’t feel ready. But I absolutely do not want to rent it out or sell so it has to be now.I dumped that boyfriend really soon after I posted bc he told me he couldn’t believe I was still crying over my mom.

	"body" : "32f. I've been with my husband Jake for 4 years now. Prior to dating Jake I was self employed. I bought houses that were in ruin, fixed them and sold them for below market value. I sold my first home at 19. The only reason I was able to become as successful as I was was because I had the help of my dad, my brother and my uncle. If it weren't for them, I probably wouldn't have brought in much of a profit because I would have had to hire out for work needed on the homes. We always split the profit evenly. When I met my now husband, I had over $600k saved.Now, my husband was honestly fantastic. We never stopped laughing and he just made me so damn happy all the time. I tried getting him involved with my business after about a year. He tried but gave up easily because he \"didn't have the skills for this\". Ever since then he has been in and out of different careers. In late 2021 I got pregnant and I put my house flipping on hold. The last job I did was in September 2021. Our daughter is now 2.When she was 7 months I told my husband I wanted to start house flipping again. But at the end of it, he started putting stuff in my head about how difficult it would be with a baby and how he doesn't think it's a good idea and how I should just wait a bit and it made me feel really back peddled but at the end of the day, I said \"well maybe you're right, I will wait I guess\" despite really wanting to start again. But a month ago I couldn't shake it anymore. I told him \"I'm starting this up again and I really don't care what people have to say about it. I want to do it, I'm doing it.\" He said \"Okay, I support you no matter what\". But then a week or so ago he started talking to me about his business idea and he's like \"yeah so I figured you could manage the whole thing\". I told him I didn't know if I could manage running two operations with a 2yo and he goes \"well I figured you could just put off your thing for a couple years while we see if this works\". I told him I didn't want to put off my thing and he got irritated and said \"this can be OUR thing as a family. House flipping is a washed out market and there's too much risk involved and we would be pushing out too much money and I'm excluded so I think we should just do this instead.\" I told him that HE wouldn't be pushing out any money and I don't hire out so no, he's wrong. And he goes \"you split all profit with your dad, uncle and brother. I want to start something where we aren't paying other people for their part and we can pocket all profit.\" So, I told him he needed to stop trying to control my life because this is the 2nd year he's tried convincing me not to do something that made me successful to begin with, that I LOVE doing. He says I'm an AH for seeing it as him being controlling and not seeing it as him trying to better our future as a family.",

Last night, his mother texted me telling me I am not allowed to name her granddaughter Mavka because she googled it and didn't like the name interpretations she found. I told her I was aware of the Ukrainian folklore, but that was the name my husband and I had agreed on after many many months of debate and searching for a name that fit all our criteria. She then proceeded to tell me I was being selfish, careless, thoughtless, etc and she refused to call her that or tell anyone that was her name. I told her she didn't have to like the name, but it was not her decision to make. I tell my husband his mother is arguing with me about the baby's name and he asks me if she told me why. I told him she had, but me and him had already discussed those meanings when I first stumbled across the name (children's movie on Hulu). Of course, he has no recollection of this  due to his reaction, I asked him if she had already spoken to him about this and he said yes! So I asked him why he thought it was appropriate for her to approach me about it instead of him and he claimed to not know she was going to say something to me. And he didn't say another word about it, so I don't really know where he stands on the name anymore but I know he's not going to argue with me about it this close to birth, especially since I've already ordered her personalized swaddles with that name on them. I continued texting with his mother, trying to assure her the name was fine, crying in frustration that he ignored, until she told me she'd lost all respect for me. At that point, I no longer want her around for the birth. My friend told me that was going too far, but honestly I feel like if you have no respect for me and aren't supportive, then you have no business being there. I haven't told my husband or his mother yet, but I'm sure it'll be a fight. I'll have them both removed from the room if I have to, but of course I don't want to have this kind of drama during a time that is supposed to be joyous. Thoughts??",

Before moving away for college, I relied on my parents for everything; I depended on them. I didn't know how to cook, clean, look after my money, or handle any situation I got into.

She never knows whats she wants for her birthday, so I always have to guess something to give her. She always loved my gifts. Those gifts are usually around €50-70 ish.I have had a high profile job for the past 3 years. While I dont throw my momeny away, I do like to spend it on some more high quality products. I live together with my boyfriend (32M) and he also earns a nice paycheck. So we live a but more \"upperclass\". This is also kind of the financial situation me and my sister grew up in.My sister has only had 1 job in her life at a supermarket years ago for only a few months. She is studying ans getting her degree (which when she gets it, she will be working as a dentist so she will make a lot of money which she has to mention everytime I ask her about her studies). She lives with her boyfriend (31M). He earns a little above minimum wage and they live in the worst part of town. She pays nothing, he pays everything. Which is their buisniss and is totally fine to me. In our country this income is enough to pay for a small apartment and all the bills on time. My parents fully pay her eduction. So they are not poor at all.When my birthday was in the Summer, she gave me a gift that was about €15. I was really happy with it and thanked her a lot for it. I do not care how much it costed, but the fact that she listed to what I wanted meant a lot to me.Now her birthday is in a few weeks. She finally came up with something she wanted: merch from her favorite band. I was happy she finally came up with something. Promblem is that band only has a merch store in the States and we live in Europe. There are still lots of delays because of black friday/holliday shipping with the post and the merch website estimated that shipping would take up till March. Also, the shipping and important tax combined are more then double of what the merch would cost. I dont like that for a gift, that the bulk of my money would go in shipping and taxes plus it would be here way too late. It would go from €35 to over €80 with all these extra costs. About €50 just for shipping and taxes.When I tried to explain this to her on the phone she got pissed. She said that I order stuff from around the world all the time (not true) so I would have no trouble with paying a high shipping cost and taxes. When I explained to her that this is not the case and if those extra costs are so high I just dont buy it because I find it a waste of money she just said \"but you got plenty\". I thought to myself okay I should just try to keep the peace and ask her if she would like something else for her birthday. She responded with either a shopping trip with my credit card or a pair of €250 shoes. When I responded with that I found that outrageous, she called me a self absorbed b*tch and ended the phone call and has not responded to my texts or calls since.AITA?",

From what my wife has told me, the condition feels terrible but otherwise is manageable and won't affect the baby.Mary was recently hospitalized for a few days due to dehydration/electrolyte imbalance because of this condition. My wife and I decided to wait until she got home to visit her. We went over a few days ago.Scene: Mary & her husband's house. It was me, my wife, sister-in-law, her husband, my father-in-law, mother-in-law, and my wife's brother.We're sitting around and talking. After the initial concern and talks about her health, the conversation became more light-hearted. We're watching the game and eating when my father-in-law mentions to Mary \"in a few months, this will all be past you and you'll have a baby in your arms. Have you narrowed down the names?\"Mary says: \"We're trying to, but he's already rejected my top 3 boy names.\"Something about that really rubbed me the wrong way. I was raised to respect women and appreciate the sacrifice they make to carry a baby. When my wife was pregnant, not only did her say go with baby names, but I made sure that those 9 months were the most relaxing and calm time possible. I picked up every extra shift so she could let go of her crappy job and stay home to rest when her blood pressure got a little high. I did as much as I could around the house too. And obviously the person who is carrying the baby and whose body goes through that pain got to pick the names, I wasn't gonna complain about that. She got princess treatment for all 3 pregnancies and I still believe I didn't do enough.So him watching his wife throw up multiple times a day, suffer from nausea all day, literally be hospitalized from the pains of pregnancy and yet he can't give her the happiness of naming her baby what she wants? It set me off and I pulled him aside a few minutes later in the kitchen and let him have it. Basically saying what I said above and outlining how I didn't respect him for his actions, in the least.Long story short - my wife believes that I shouldn't have said anything and should've just vented about it in the car.

She told me i don’t do anything, just sit at home all day and be lazy. when i pointed out that all of this was because my body is still recovering from being racked from chemo, and she said that it was “months ago” (3 months) and that i needed to stop using it as an excuse to be lazy. I told her (well i was yelling - admittedly) that it wasn’t that long ago, and that it takes a very long time to recover from chemo, and i probably never fully will. she didn’t think this was a real answer, and just told me that i should be “over it” by now.i feel like this doesn’t sound like much, but it is important to note that all throughout my treatment i have really struggled with my lack of ability to do anything.

All of my hobbies pre-chemo were active, riding horses, running, hiking, archery, and i can barely do any of them. I constantly feel like a useless unproductive slug, and to have her say that has mentally fucked me up.I always blamed my sisters nasty comments on her age, or the fact that she’s the youngest and got no parenting, but she’s getting older now and this comment feels inexcusable. Even at 19 i never would have dreamt of saying that to someone in my position, and I honestly feel like I can’t forgive her . At least, not unless she gives me a genuine apology, which she has no intention of doing, in fact she doubled down on her statement s.My family thinks i’m over-reacting, and that I shouldn’t burn down our relationship over this, They think its just unnecessary discourse, but i can’t get over it. she knew what it meant, and still doesn’t care.

	"body" : "To preface: Me (31F) and my husband (33M) had our daughter Mary (16F) at a very young age. She was an accident and it was very hard at first, but we managed to raise a wonderful young lady.In middle school, Mary had a best friend Dan (16M). They were really close and since we’re neighbors, we encouraged them to hang out together.However as they started high school, Dan started running with the wrong crowd. He befriended a kid who would sneak out, drink, engage in destructive activities. Together they started bullying Mary. Since then I have some sort of a slow beef with Dan’s mom (44F). We are on speaking terms, but things are somewhat rough between us. I personally consider her parenting style a little too lax, she thinks I'm being too strict.It escalated when this kid pissed in Mary’s car’s gas tank. To say I was fuming was an understatement. I turned into a full-blown momzilla. I was ready to sue his whole family, luckily it didn’t happen since his mom was cooperative and compensated for the damage. I also told Dan’s mom that her kid’s friend destroyed my daughter’s property. No reaction.Obviously, things escalated further. Dan and his friend committed a felony. To be honest, it was expected of his friend, but the fact that Dan was an accomplice shocked me deeply. He’s a gentle and kind guy and it was horrible that he fell under bad influence. Dan’s mom was shocked as well, but to be honest it was something that she could expect after finding out that her kid got under bad influence, doing nothing about it, buying him substances so he could share with his friends. We live in CO btw, but still weed isn't something I'd introduce my child to.That was what I openly told her after she complained about “how come my precious baby commit a felony” and “how did you manage to make Mary avoid the sketchy stuff”. I told her that if she was slightly stricter with her parenting, she’d avoid Dan having legal troubles now. She told me that I’m being hypocritical since I did quite an amount of stupid stuff in my youth too. I did, and I’m not proud of it. But I’ve never touched substances and I’ve never committed a felony. I took the responsibility and accepted the consequences and managed to raise a decent human being who won’t repeat my mistakes.I’m an insightful person and I’ve been thinking now whether it was worth it to drag the conflict for all this time and escalating it into an open confrontation.",

	"body" : "Hi, I'm a single mother with a son halfway through his first year of school. We happen to live in an apartment complex with a handful of kids that are also in elementary school. The bus stop (which is really just one of the entrances to the complex) is within eye shot from my apartment, and so unless it's raining or extremely cold, my son and I just walk there.At first, when the school year started, everything seemed fine. But as it continued, I noticed two particular parents (to separate children) standing farther and farther away from the bus stop each morning. It became a common occurrence to see one mother watching her kids stand at their stop from her upstairs apartment balcony and another mother standing across the street and in a parking lot.This morning, for reasons beyond me, the only two families at the bus stop was myself and the mother who stands as far away as she can across the street. And within a few minutes of my arrival, she leaves.Now here is the issue, because of some special circumstances, my son goes to a different school than what he's zoned for. Which means a bus that is meant specifically for him comes 10-20 minutes before everyone else's bus. Which meant unless I wanted to leave these children alone and unsupervised for that long, I'd have to wait with them. And this morning I did.It's a well known fact of the neighborhood that my son takes a different bus, as at the beginning of the school year I had accidentally caused mass confusion when my son and I would show up at the bus stop long before everyone else. This mother has never once spoken to me. I don't know her kids. My kid doesn't even know her kids.I don't know why she showed up so early this morning, but if I'm once again left alone with a stranger's kids, would I be the asshole if I just went home?",

	"body" : "So 18 months ago I split from my husband and we now amicably co-parent our 5yo and 3yo who are both very close to their dad. His work requires moving every few years and I followed him wherever he needed to go during our marriage but he never seemed grateful and didn't acknowledge that I sacrificed a lot for his job. He was also very assertive about the things he wanted to do and not do with his time so I didn't prioritize the things I wanted because I felt like I shouldn't inconvenience him.Our last move was close to my home town and we bought a house in order to settle here long term, thinking his moving days were done. After our separation our plan was still to live near to each other in this area for the sake of the kids. He has now been unexpectedly asked to do a 2 year project in a far away town. His plan is to try fly back every second weekend to see the kids.Working around his work schedule, I agreed to go away with the kids for a weekend next month, with some close friends who are visiting from overseas and have kids of the same age. He now wants to change his schedule, and wants me to leave the kids with him and not take them away with me that weekend. The reason is because his dad turns 70 the weekend before, so he now wants to go visit his dad that weekend instead of the kids.  If he does this, that means they don't see each other for 3 weeks.My answer to him was that I'm not willing to change my plans. I spent so long fitting my life into the gaps between his career and his plans, and I don't want to do that anymore. It feels unfair to ask me to not take the kids on this weekend away because he wants to change his schedule. I am finally planning things for myself. I obviously don't want the kids to not see their dad for 3 weeks, but it is his decision to move away and now to change his schedule at the last minute, but he expects me to change my plans to accommodate him and thinks I am being unreasonable by saying no. He says his dad's 70th birthday is more important than my weekend away with friends, and that immediately makes me feel guilty, but I also feel like that is an unfair summation of the issue. It's not like he asked nicely and acknowledged that it would be a sacrifice either, and I feel so tired of feeling like I don't matter. AITA for taking a stand on this?To clarify: grandad's birthday is happening the one weekend and he had originally not planned to go to it (different city) but he had planned to visit the kids. The following weekend is my weekend away and he had originally was not going to be in town. So he wants to go to his dad instead of to the kids, and then I leave the kids at home and go away without them so that he can visit them that weekend instead.",

To make things clear my problem isn't that my son's dating another man, is that he's dating a complete bum.His boyfriend literally stinks of booze to the point it's noticeable just if he breathes in your general direction. And if he spends too much time in a room the smell literally starts lingering. When I talked with my son about it he just defended him saying that he's not drinking much but his bad teeth are intensifying the booze smell from his breath. I have no idea if that's a complete bullcrap my son's using to not admit his boyfriend is a complete drunk, but either way his smell still obnoxious as hell and it doesn't seem like his boyfriend tries to cover it up at all.And the second thing his boyfriend's doing is making so many backhanded comments towards my wife (and son's mother) for literally no reason. He keeps telling my wife stuff like \"you look pretty tired today\" or even \"you should take a shower later, you look like you really need it\" and my son doesn't even see any of these comments as rude and thinks I'm overreacting whenever I call his boyfriend out of them.Honestly I've had it with this boyfriend of his and I told my son that he's not allowed to bring him anymore to my house till his boyfriend cleans up his act and stops stinking up the house (with both his behavior and his smell). My son however thinks that I'm only banning him cause I'm a homophobe and I'm using weak arguments to hide my bigotry.

All I remember during my childhood is my Mom constantly bitching how she never gets to travel anywhere, but her and my Dad could literally NEVER plan a vacation. It would end in screaming matches because my Mom would list off 100 places she didn’t want to go but would never provide insight into where she actually wanted to travel. Anyway, we don’t have to dive into that trauma today but this is to paint a picture of what family traveling/planning has always been like. And no, they did not avoid leisure vacations due to finances. My parents have always been well off, my Dad has always had hotel points, and I saw them throw away over 300,000 air fare points because they let them expire before choosing a trip.Scenario: I (30F) recently traveled to Arizona with my family (Mom 66F, Dad 68M) for my sister’s (34F) wedding. The wedding was in Phoenix and then me, my boyfriend, my sister and brother in law made plans to stay in Sedona the following week. My Mom said Sedona has always been her ‘dream vacation’ and decided she wanted to go too. Unfortunately her schedule only allowed us to drive up to Sedona for a day and enjoy it but I was still happy to drive her and enjoy the experience together.We had 11 months to plan our vacations. I spent months and months researching and booking everything in advance for my week in Sedona. Excursions, tours, hikes, hotel, and every single dining reservation I made in advance. I kept telling my Mom to book stuff ahead of time because Sedona can sometimes take 1-2 months of booking in advanced during tourist season to eat at the popular restaurants. Throughout these 11 months, I even sent her all of my itinerary to help her decide what she wants to do. I’d constantly ask where she chose to eat, what we’re doing that day, etc but she never responded or put anything into action. Three weeks before we left, she still hadn’t planned anything.. so I decided fuck it and stopped worrying about it.The day comes and we leave around 10am for Sedona… we get to Sedona around 12pm. My Mom asks “so what are we doing? I’m hungry, where are we eating?” I looked at her and said this is your vacation, I didn’t plan or book anything. You decide what we do. She got furious and proceeded to yell at me. She ended up giving me the first panic attack I’ve had in over 5 years. She was angry for the remainder of the day. We walked 0.5miles at cathedral rock and walked around the tourist trap stores.So… this has been bothering me as she continues to guilt trip me.

He thinks I should stay, and says he may come back after he works on himself but the apartment is too big and expensive for just me and was supposed to be where we started a family and got married.Due to having to pay for the miscarriage procedure out of pocket(he didn’t pay any portion) and Christmas presents, I can’t handle all the rent on my own. He agreed to pay the majority for the next two months, but his mom (57f) is saying it’s not fair because he doesn’t live here anymore and instead thinks he should just tell the landlord he’s moving out and disregard me. All his furniture and belongings are here and he hasn’t gotten a new place and he stays over 2 nights a week. She also discouraged therapy for us. I suspect she is a big reason for him ending things as it was really out of the blue and not like him to leave when things get tough and also doesn’t really seem like what he really wants. It’s strange to me because they both really liked me and called me part of the family and I’m not sure how a miscarriage could trigger such emotions as opposed to empathy/support for me. I’m guessing his mom never liked me but pretended to for some reason and the thought of us being stuck together by a child freaked her out so when I had a miscarriage she decided to reveal how she really felt to him? They are very close and he has a lot of childhood trauma from her always yelling at him and making him do whatever she says. She blocked me so I am not able to ask her what is going on, we previously had a great relationship and talked weekly. All his clothes and furniture are still here and he has no plans of taking it out so I have no clue what is actually happening between us.

Carmen said she would be moving out at the end of the lease since we signed it about a year ago, Molly and I were planning on staying at the house together and re-leasing with a roommate that we would find later. Well I got an opportunity to buy a house with my boyfriend so I'm taking that opportunity and am currently helping Molly find 2 new roommates to replace Carmen and I on the new lease that ends in a few weeks. The reason for this is that Molly doesn't want to leave the house, it's close to our college campus and the rent is good so I want to help her so that she can stay, but still be able to afford rent.We hadn't heard many updates from Carmen other than her original plan leaving the state and moving in with her girlfriend that lives out of state. We supported her decision as this seemed like something that would make her happy. Well, Molly found a couple looking to rent that she's friends with and decided to move forward with them on the next lease. She told me and Carmen about it a few nights ago and I noticed Carmen got kinda uncomfortable and worried. She pulled me aside later and said that she had assumed that Molly hadn't found anyone and that her and her Girlfriend had discussed several weeks ago about her moving down here and just resigning the lease with her, her girlfriend and Molly. I told her that she should have spoken up about wanting to change plans as neither of us knew that she wanted to stay down here when the original lease ended.Something to note is that Molly does not get along with Carmen's girlfriend as the few times she's come to visit has left the house a mess and expected others to pick up stuff because \"she's the guest\" as well as just ignoring me and Molly all around.Well Molly told carmen that it's too late to change her mind as she has already told the couple that the rooms will be available and the landlord was already in agreement with the new plan. Carmen tried to complain to me, but I told her she shouldn't have made assumptions about anything without asking and should have told Molly about the change in plans from the beginning. I also told her that it was presumptuous of her to assume Molly would be okay with living with both of them. Carmen is now trying to tell people that Molly is trying to make her and her girlfriend homeless, which isn't true as we are both trying to help them apartment hunt.",

My boyfriend says she didn’t contribute to buying it, so I don’t have to tell her I’m keeping it.My stuff includes all kitchen appliances , dishes, pots and pans, silverware, etc. except a keurig and a cheese grater, a few mugs and a plate and bowl.Literally everything else that would go in a kitchen is mine.

I wouldn’t leave her with no shower head.I tried to tell her 8 months ago that I was keeping my appliances/pans when I moved, and to please be gentle with them, and she said “we’ll see about that.”The reason I’m asking is because I genuinely believe she thinks she’s keeping some of my stuff and gets upset when I try to clarify anything so I’m kind of stuck.A couple of you have said it’s shitty to take the WiFi and I don’t understand how if it is literally mine.

That led to a ten-minute debate amongst the families about which is preferred, and not everyone agreed with us. FWIW, we provided a choice of either disposable cups or drinking glass because we are aware some people are particular about that. So, are we the  A-holes for not providing bottled water, should we provide bought water next time?",

	"body" : "Long story short I have a 1 year old and my sister in law threw a baby shower for me last year. When we sent out the invites my best friend who lives a couple hours away immediately told me she wouldn’t be making it and she would drop off a gift next time she came down. She never did, and never stopped by when she came to town. Just to back track a bit, when I told this friend I was pregnant she lashed out on me and cried because “I know that she wants a baby too” but that’s a whole other story eyerollAnyways her and her partner are now having a baby in the coming year. She wants me to be the “keeper of the gender,” and plan, set up and host her party. I told her I would try my best to help her plan it but there is no guarantee I can be there and she said “okay well you would NEED to be there, you’re the keeper of the gender.” She has been sort of snappy ever since we had this conversation.Now I am just sort of feeling sour about the whole thing/ her in general.. she put absolutely no effort into being there for me while I was pregnant, puts no effort into our friendship and knowing my child but now I’m expected to throw her an extravagant gender reveal?!  Am I the A hole for wanting to say no? Part of me wants to do it because I know I would have liked the same kind of support from her, but the other part of me wants to tell her to kick rocks.",

About 3 days ago they came over for I believe the next 3 weeks. When they are over me and my stepsister share a room. I Really don't want to sound like I'm spoiled but I HATE when they come over. They're loud, annoying and always cause a stupid amount of commotion.I think 2 days ago tho, we were all in the living room, I was reading while a movie was playing. Just like always I heard some sort of commotion and when I looked up the 2 boys were full on wrestling on the floor. I didnt mind it too much but the thudding was causing the floor to shake (we were upstairs). I was already getting annoyed but then my stepsister turned the volume up to a stupid loud volume to tune them out which made it almost impossible to focus on my reading. Then while the 2 were rough housing they full on stumbled right on top of me.To their credit when they got off of me they did apologize and IK they didnt mean it but I was PISSED, I cussed them out pretty hard. My stepsister tried to chime in telling me to calm down and I snapped at her too cause she turned the volume up way more than needed. The 2 stepbrothers didnt say much but my stepsister got pretty pissed and clapped back at me. After like 30 seconds I realized I was getting more heated than I needed too and just walked away. While I was walking away to our room I said something like \"How about you guys just go live with your mom full time; fuck\".After that I didnt hear from either till around bed time when my stepsister came in. I didnt say anything to her but she called me a \"Fucking bitch\" and went straight to bed. My 2 stepbrothers dont really care what I said but I dont even think they were paying attention to anything I said but my stepsister is ignoring me hard. Like flat out won't answer me if I ask her specifically a question.So I'm curious now AITA?EDIT:I know its gonna get asked and I forgot to put it in, but my mom and stepdad were on a dinner date when the whole situation happened so they didnt know about it.EDIT 2:It won't let me comment, but for ages, me and my stepsister are 16 and the boys are 13 and 14.",

One of the students is wearing heavy amounts of very white makeup with black eyeshadow and lipstick with crazy black hair. Yeah, they clearly look weird. Uncle sends a text with the picture, \"Well this is a first\".The comment maybe normally sounds lightly harmless but I know that T is essentially making fun of this kid. T is one of those that quotes JRE all the time, rants that \"everyone is a snowflake\", cant stop mentioning \"libtard\" and trans issues. So I knew exactly where his heart was when he made his comment.  I went off on him on our group chat:This is honestly bullshit. This is something a fucking 12 year old would do.You’re their substitute teacher. You’re their guardian for the hour or day you’re there. You don’t fucking send this shit.“This is a first”So the fuck what? Grow up. Get the fuck over it. These are KIDS. Let them fucking be. You talk about snowflakes? This kid has you so triggered you’re willing to risk your job taking a personal picture on your phone of their names and student ids, and then SEND it? You know that’s an actual fucking crime and you drag [brother] and I into it by doing that shit.Not okay. Not okay at all.Well, turns out other brother, K, thinks Im way overreacting and that this isn't a big deal at all, and some harsh words were exchanged between us. K is arguing I should have just wrote, \"Delete the pic and say hey maybe you should reconsider doing this next time\" and then I \"move the fuck on\". K also wrote, \"All T texted was 'This is a first' …. As in wow never seen a student do this before, you're insinuating the rest\". Which is total BS because students have been wearing tons of makeup and drag for decades now, so this is NOT a first.For me, this issue is three fold:Im a volunteer teacher in addition to my job at a Fortune 100 company. Being involved in a group chat like this feels like the kind of thing that gets leaked and then people get fired over. At the least I lose my involvement in volunteer teaching.Depending on the local governing body, sharing minor PID (personally identifiable data) like their student ID w/ names and photos in one screenshot is likely illegal.Who the fuck does this? They're kids! Leave them alone, dont send shit like that. They dress weird, so what? You're a 40 year old grown man.Brothers are saying Im way overreacting.",

Last year, she convinced me to add a line to my account so her then 12 year old son could have a way to contact her when he wasn’t home. So I did, I’ve been paying 65 bucks a month for this kids phone. Let’s fast forward a bit, this kid is now 14 years old, and he loses his charger all the time. When we don’t immediately fix this problem, he starts flipping out, cursing at his mom and trying to get in her face. I do not get to punish him, but neither of his parents do anything about his behavior. His dad just buys a new charger everytime he does this. Enabling his behavior. I have had it at this moment, so I told him I am taking away your phone for behaving this way. Fast forward, his mom gives the phone back to him the next morning after I leave for work. So she isn’t caring that I set a punishment “such as no phone” so I don’t feel comfortable paying for his phone bc time and time again I have threatened to have it turned off. Because I pay for it. But I have about had it. I told his mom I didn’t want to pay for his phone anymore that she could or his father could. She didn’t feel like discussing this with me so she then tells me to contact his father and tell him that I don’t want to pay for it anymore and why. His father just “angry emoji’d” my message I sent him and has yet to respond. This kid is horrible and doesn’t deserve a phone. Has no responsibility and never gets in trouble for anything he does. He has no consequences or repercussions for anything and I try to take away something I control and it still gets overruled by his parents. Am I the asshole for refusing to pay for his phone anymore?Something I guess I need to add. I am a woman, not a man.

I got a new laptop almost straight away.My sister didn't know about the new laptop until a few days ago.

I said no and my mum encouraged me to keep saying no until she apologised to me.Well tonight, I was called for a meeting where my sister was sobbing. She apologised and begged me again to let her use my laptop. She says she is really stressed about it and can't keep making excuses to her teacher. I suggested some times and places where she could do her work elsewhere, like going to class early or using the public library, but she made excuses as to why she couldn't. I said I would think about it but I seriously don't want her anywhere near my new laptop.Later, my mum spoke to me about it. She is defending my sister and saying I need to be a good sister and let her use it. I disagree. She was a bad sister for letting people into my room, letting them steal my money and destroying my property.

I told them I'm coming on here to post and asking for judgment; we're from the UK.I'm a first-year PhD student; it's a full-time job. I'm at university 5 days a week, 9:00 am to 5:00 pm; I'm never at home, including weekends, as I have a part-time job, also 9:00 am to 5:00 pm as I need to support myself.Three months before I became a PhD student, I was successful in purchasing my own house; the mortgage is £690.00 per month. Including the mortgage, the bills rack up to a total of £1,311.00. My income is around £2,300.00 per month. I've also got university costs to pay for, so after food, travel, and fees are deducted, I'm left with nothing for the month. I allowed my sister to move into my spare room. But I made sure she signed a tenancy agreement; for protection, I did state her rent is £400.00 per month. At first, I didn't chase this around. However, my sister is jobless; she sits in my house all day and is either on her devices, eating or sleeping. I come home every day, and when I do, it's cooking dinner, cleaning, and going to sleep. I don't feel it's fair to pay for 100% of the bills when I'm never in the first place. I've started requesting that my sister pay rent; she states every time she doesn't have it, and I'm keeping a record of how much arrears she's in.I've made a final offer: she either starts paying, or I'll evict her legally. She told my parents when I said that and they were pissed with me for threatening her with legal action. I've explained the only way I'll allow her to stay is if she gets a full-time job and pays half the monthly bills (I did add a clause in the rental agreement about this so I'm protected). I regret not making her pay sooner. My sister only wants a part-time job; she would be on minimum wage and have practically nothing at the end of the month. My family and I had a third argument about this; they called me an asshole as my sister is autistic; they said I'm being selfish because she's autistic and she wouldn't cope in the real world.AITA? Personally, I don't feel I am but your thoughts would create a piece of mind. I do have a best friend who is willing to move in and pay exactly half the household bills.",

I got pissed at him and told him he was out of line.Unsure of what to do, I decided to call Emily and discuss the situation. She seemed oblivious to our past issues and genuinely believed we were still close. When I explained that our friendship had ended due to her behavior, she became defensive and insisted it was a misunderstanding.Feeling frustrated, I told her bluntly that I didn't want her at the wedding. She became emotional, pleading with me to reconsider, saying she had changed and deserved a chance. She tried being toxic again by saying that I'm purposely trying to ruin her life and that we're family and that all our family members would be disappointed in me if I excluded her and that's not how family treats each other.I, however, stood my ground, citing the toxicity of our past and my desire for a drama-free wedding.After the call, I shared the details with my fiancé, who fully supported my decision. We decided not to invite Emily, prioritizing our happiness over potential conflicts on our special day.Jake, upset with my choice, claimed I should be more forgiving, especially considering the occasion.My fiancé and I are standing firm, but I'm left wondering if I was too harsh.

My husband is a stay at home dad, has not had a job since my twins were 1. Recently I have been coming home frustrated because my husband just starts playing video games and continues all night, I tell him since he is home he need to be making meals for the kids that include vegetables not just pizza nuggets ect, he still only does it once in a while. I have also been coming home to constant dirty dishes, and laundry,  the laundry is mostly washed but stuffed in Laundry baskets constantly ( there are currently 4 full baskets) and it stays that way unless I do it or tell him he needs to and he usually doesn’t finish it all. The bathrooms are never cleaned properly there is green stuff that starts to stick in the toilet bowl so I will have to clean it thoroughly. Today we got in a fight because he yet again stayed up playing games all night after I got home from work, I went to bed around 10 because I get tired after being on my feet all day for 12+ hours. I woke up around 9:30 am, my husband was still sleeping. All my kids were already awake I fed them some breakfast but there wasn’t much in the fridge. I waited for my husband to wake up to ask him if he can go grocery shopping, by 12:30ish I asked him if he could go, he didn’t get up. He didn’t wake up until nearly 4 that afternoon. I was  furious I am always coming home to no toilet paper, food, ect and have to go get it myself, while he has more than enough time all day while I’m at work and the kids are in school. I yelled at him and told him he should already have food in the house and that he doesn’t do anything all day. I was just so frustrated that it’s a constant thing and I would understand if the kids were home all day with him, but they are not they are at school till 3:30 every day, and he still acts like he does everything and has no time in his day to get to the things I mention. So aitah for telling him he does nothing? Update My husband does clean the house just seems to struggle with the specific things I mentioned above and cook , but needs to include veggies more often in my opinion. He also takes my children to all their sports ect. He cooks for me on my days off usually as well but does have days when does the gaming all night sleeping all day.

Toys are scattered everywhere downstairs (living room, kitchen, entryway), food is caked onto the kitchen floor and the high chair from the infant, and dishes are left out with food hardening on them.In addition, things just start to pile up around the house over time from never being put away. Clothes are tossed on or at the base of the stairs until they are a huge pile, things that have been taken out are just left on the tables or countertops until those are piled up as well. Some of this stuff is kid items but some are also my spouse's items that are used and never put away. Our bedroom has food and trash everywhere and every night our bed has crumbs all over because our kids wake up (8-9 AM) and my spouse sends them downstairs to get food to eat in bed with them so my spouse can sleep more.Every few months we have people over for some reason or another and there is always a fight leading up to it because of the mess. It takes us multiple days of cleaning for hours a day to get the house in a state where we can have guests over. I get extremely frustrated because the bulk of our cleaning comes from cleaning up the accrued daily mess that happens while I am working.  We clean up for multiple days to have people over and within a week the house is back to where it looks like we never cleaned at all.I understand that being a stay at home spouse and caring for kids is a job in it's own right but I feel like part of that includes picking up after the kids so we aren't left with this giant mess constantly. If things were picked up throughout the day then we wouldn't have such a large list of things to do once the kids are in bed. I also feel that if you take something out to use, you put it away when you are done instead of leaving it on the counter.I'm not expecting my spouse to do things like clean the bathrooms or do all the dishes daily, just pick up after themselves and the kids during the day as they go.

But it started happening more and in front of our parents and they said nothing and when I mentioned it to them they had zero reaction and basically ignored the topic.Since September/October all she has called me is dad and I tried to talk to her but I guess I don't know how to talk to a 4 year old in a way that she'll get because she just keeps doing it and it's frustrating but also worrying me.

She has accepted the children I brought to the relationship as her own grandchildren and for that I am incredibly thankful.My (42F) and my husband (41M) have been married 7 years, together for damn near 10.  I have a horde of 5 (3 are grown) and he has 2.  Cindy 22 and Joey 16.This has to do with Joeys mother, let's call her Gertrude. Gertrude and I do not have a good relationship.  From the beginning she made it SO clear that Joey will \"NEVER call you (me) mom!\" Ok, cool.   I was totally on board, I'll just be yours truly, I already have my own brood, I dont need any more.  Before you come at me for that, Joey has ALWAYS been treated like one of my own kids.  I refuse to make him feel less than.  I certainly dont talk negatively about his mother either, well to or anywhere around him that is.Gertrude has told me that anything to do with Joey and his dad is none of my business.  Sure. I get that, I'm not his parent, however I will tell him no, assign consequences (minor, like no dessert if there was misbehavior, etc), not make any life altering decisions in his regard, normal step parent stuff.  She would contact me regarding petty nonsense (like wanting me to wake up my husband so she could bitch at him), then when I would tell her that I am not to be involved, per her request, I get called a saboteur and that Im trying to come between Joey and his dad.  Uh, what?!Of course she would test me through Joey. Ex, \"my mom cooks better than you do, she told me so\".  He's get a reply along the lines of \"Joey, I've heard she makes some super delicious food! I bet it IS fantastic! Maybe one day I will be lucky enough to try some!\"  He stopped testing me after a while.Now onto the crux, my  MiL keeps telling me how Gertrude had this going on in her life, Gertrude this and that.  I understand that she is Joey's mom, and therefore is part and parcel of the family I married into.  The issue is, my MiL knows that we don't see eye to eye, I've finally told her that I legitimately do not give a rats ass about her, what she's doing, how her life is, etc.  In fact, I try to avoid contact with her if at all possible.My MiL has told me some of the things Gertrude has said about me, and seemed genuinely bewildered when I said I want nothing to do with her if at all possible and am perfectly alright not hearing about her life.So tell me Reddit, AITA for telling my mother in law I don't want to know boo about my husband's ex wife even though she is the mother of his son?P.s.

I'm her only child and I figured it was just “empty nest.” I'd come back for holidays and she would come to my sport meets A LOT. It was nice to have a supportive parent there.Things escalated when I started medical school. My free time was greatly reduced. I would still visit for holidays, but even then I still had to study. My mom didn't understand how important this was to me and how busy I had gotten, and actively guilt tripped me about the reduced time spent with her. I still did sports, but I stopped competing. It was too much. She continued to push for me to compete because that was how she got to spend time with me. I tried first year but after trying to study on planes and in air bnbs with bad internet, I realized it was unsustainable. We had a big fight and I set my boundaries. She did not take me seriously. My mom tried to manipulate me to continue competing and saying that I'm \"so smart\" I can afford to take time out of my studies to do fun things with her.I had enough and went NC with her for a few months before she finally came around. Maybe it was my dad (step dad who adopted me after they were married) who convinced her.They got divorced my second year of medical school, two months after I married my now husband.When my mom overstepped my very clear boundary about prioritizing my education over competing in her sport, we got into yet another fight. She said some awful things, including blaming me for marrying my step dad because she wanted me to be \"taken care of.\" Basically blaming me for her unhappy marriage. I think seeing how happy I was with my husband who is my best friend and biggest supporter put her over the edge.I am now four months from graduation, and we have one spare bedroom in our condo. My dad was very supportive throughout my education, and was always the voice of reason. He assumed I would pick my mom over him to stay with me and booked a hotel for the graduation weekend. My best friend from college was also super supportive, and wants to be there to see me graduate. I want her to stay with me because she's one of my best friends and I haven't seen her in over a year. My mom got extremely upset when I told her she was coming and I would host her. It came to light my mom expected me to host her and her new boyfriend at my condo.

On a leash he is perfectly well behaved when encountering male dogs.Now I live with my dog, my cousin (who is like my sister) as of October. She was taking care of her friend Mike's dog for the past year because he decided to go volunteer for some foreign legion in Ukraine. The other dog is very docile, lovely older dog, but a male. When we moved in, my cousin told me that Mike was coming back from Ukraine in December and that then the other dog would be gone.  In between that time, we had the dogs in the house, and there were a couple altercations between them so we eventually segregated the house with a baby gate and that was fine. Dave came to get the dog in December, all was well.This morning she tells me that Mike is dropping off his dog again today and going back to Ukraine, and doesn't know when he will be back. I am annoyed because 1. This dog wasn't supposed to be coming back at all and 2. They gave me no warning. Literally the dog will be here in an hour. I don't have a problem with the dog, he is very sweet, but my dog is definitely the problem. My cousin says that if I don't want to be stressed out by the baby gate and splitting the house I should just hire a behaviorist trainer...but that is very expensive and I have money troubles as it is! I told her that it's great that her friend is volunteering in Ukraine but ultimately unfair of him to dump his dog on us and he should find someone else or at the very least should have given us more time.She is annoyed saying that we need to be accommodating to Mike because he is doing good work in Ukraine...ok fine, that's awesome - but I still don't think this situation is fair!! I am not knocking his work, but the inconsideration of just leaving his dog with us when it was only supposed to be a few months!! AITA?Edit: my cousin and I are renting this house are both on the lease. I paid pet deposit and she didn't. The landlords don't know there is another dog coming.",

	"body" : "I (41f) have celiac disease, an autoimmune disease where I cannot eat gluten, not even cross contamination. Because of this and other health issues, I have a pretty restricted diet, e.g.  dairy free. I also seldom eat processed foods but when I do they are small helpings. My husband (40m), \"Steve\", and I only buy certified gluten free and dairy free snacks, which we share. These are usually expensive compared to normal snacks and not always easily available (e.g., I buy them online so they take a while to arrive).By his choice (which I definitely appreciate), Steve doesn't eat gluten at home so as not to worry about cross contamination. He either eats gluten outside the house or the GF snacks/food at home. He can buy a mini fridge for the garage if he wants gluten products at home, altho he is only willing to eat them outside, such as the backyard patio table. He finally bought the fridge a week ago even though he could have a long time ago.The problem: For some reason, Steve kept finishing the GF snacks. There were a few incidences before I finally got very angry when Steve ate a whole box of crackers. Bare in mind, snacks for me are rare treats, so I was looking forward to having ONE cracker only to unexpectedly find none. After that incident, we agreed he should always leave me a serving or give me a heads up so we don't run out before we shop again. That didn't work, so then we agreed that if there is only one serving left he has to ask me first, since he usually eats the larger portion of the snacks anyway.There were still other incidents, but the most recent egregious (prior to today), was when he finished a brand of ice cream I liked. What made things worse was there were two pints of this brand that I like and two pints of another brand he likes. Despite knowing that I never eat the brand he likes (because I don't like it), he chose to eat the brand I like and finished one pint. After the first pint, I just reminded him that he had to ask me before he finished the last serving of the second pint. He DID NOT. So again, I was left feeling upset when I went from excited about eating my ONE TABLESPOON of ice cream, to being mad and angry when there was nothing. What was left? HIS two pints of ice cream that he knew I didn't like.After THAT incident, the agreement was he won't touch the GF snacks unless he asks me first. Yet today, I go to find the leftover honeygrams I had kept in the fridge (again, because I only eat small servings), and lo and behold, there was nothing. He is at work, so I texted to confirm he ate them all, which he did. I told him to book himself for counseling because I can't take it anymore and don't know what how to fix this issue.I guess I want to know if it is fair to expect him to leave a bit of snacks for me? AITA for expecting this? AITA for making him go for counseling to resolve what I assume are underlying issues/anger against me?Edit: made changes bc I had to keep clarifying the same things.",

	"body" : "So this is a complex situation and I will do my best to keep it short. My partner and I have been living with my MIL since the beginning of May. We had fallen on hard times and she agreed to allow us to move in to get back on our feet.Despite the fact that she has a three bedroom house entirely to herself, she refused to make space for us in the main part of the house. So, we ended up fitting us and some of our things into the back corner of her freezing cold, unfinished basement. We got a storage unit that costs us almost $200 per month for the rest of our stuff because she didn’t want it there - it would have fit in our space, but she didn’t want to look at the clutter when she came down once a week to do laundry. She also wouldn’t allow our cats to come but luckily my friend took them in for the time being and we give her $30 per week for keeping them, plus of course paying for litter/food/care/etc. This was supposed to only be a couple of months.When we moved in, we sat down together and she decided that $250 per month would be our rent, plus $150 toward utilities. We said okay and have been paying that every month. But since then, she has screamed at us weekly and talked crap to everyone who will listen about how we’re taking advantage of her and she’s “providing for us.” She does not buy us groceries or anything like that, so we were confused and finally asked what we were paying her for then. This was in September.She said she has been paying the mortgage and all utilities on her own and has been putting all the money we’ve given her in an envelope as a moving fund. So things came to a head the other day because we are now starting to look for apartments and calculated that we should have about $3000 in that moving fund. We focused on paying down some of our debts so we don’t end up back in this situation again, because we trusted that she was saving this money. Now that we’re asking for it so that we can get moved, she has backtracked and said she’ll help with what she’s able to. After our huge argument about where all of this money is and why she would lie to us about it, she sent my partner and I a group text saying, “This text serves as your written 30 day notice and you WILL be out of my house by midnight on January 30.”So now on top of freaking out about where the hell we’re going to go, we have multiple people in his family calling us ungrateful assholes for “everything she’s done for us.” I’m just so exhausted by this toxic situation and I have no idea if I’m the asshole for calling her out on it because it seems like I just totally screwed us over. This is also the shortened version of all the smoke and mirrors with money that she’s pulled over this time but this is already a novel.Editing from a comment another Redditor said gives better context: Yes, we were saving since May. When we sat down for that convo in September, she demanded that I write down all of our debts and the entirety of our financial position, which I felt was fair given that she is helping us and could give advice since she’s done well for herself. She asked us what we had saved for the apartment and that’s how the agreement was come to about the moving fund. She advised us to put the money we had toward to high interest things we were paying down and then we came up with a plan together to tackle the rest of it. I really thought that we were all on the same page because she was being so awesome at that time. The conversation was “hey I’ve been putting away this money for you, don’t worry about it, pay this, this and this down.” The only thing that I can think of that changed was she spent time lately with her family that HATES that she’s helping us.",

We'll call his mom Jane (not her real name).For several months, Jane has been telling us that she would come down to our house for Christmas since our baby would still be so young. We gladly agreed since we wanted to spend Christmas at home for the first time. A few days ago, Jane mentioned that her husband didn't want to travel on Christmas anymore and asked if we could go up to their house instead. I told her that my husband and I would talk about it and get back to her.My husband and I already decided that we were going to go to my mom's side of the family since my grandparents are in their late 70s. We told Jane last night that we didn't plan on driving on Christmas day since it is harder with the baby. She mentioned that we were able to go to my side of the family's so why couldn't we go up there? I told her that we were already having issues with the baby at my family's side, so we didn't want travel two days in a row. She claimed that I prioritize my family over hers and thinks that we don't like going to her house anymore.This caused drama between her, my husband, and I. Jane's husband said that we need to make her Christmas better and go to her house to do that. I just don't understand why it was such a big deal for them to not come to our house. They would not be seeing their first granddaughter on Christmas because they didn't feel like traveling. I want to do what I think is best for my family or to help make us have a good Christmas. I feel like the drama could've all been avoided if I just would've gave in and immediately said yes to going to her house. Jane is upset over this situation as well as I am.AITA for not wanting to go to her house?EDIT: I am not able to comment so I wanted to mention that father in law had no particular reasons for not wanting to travel. It was his personal preference. My husband really wanted to see his family on Christmas, but we were going back and forth. The next time they would've wanted to see us to celebrate would be the following weekend.EDIT/UPDATE: For the people who think I hate my in laws, this isn't true. I’ve always made efforts to see them as well. I should also mention this is my first baby. I’ve never been a parent before, so I am doing what I think is best. I’ve never had to navigate life like this before. I don’t know where and when is best to keep up boundaries. I felt extremely awful that my daughter would miss her first Christmas with her grandma, so my husband and I decided to visit with the condition that we would have a conversation about what happened. The conversation didn’t happen. I plan on us all trying to talk again at a later time.",

They didn’t like it when I moved 35 miles away to go to a university, so now that I’m around 1,300 miles away, it’s a BIG deal for them and they call and text constantly. I’m genuinely shocked neither of them has tried to make me get Life360 or something, because they’re always asking where I am or what I’m doing and freaking out about every possible bad thing that could happen. It’s emotionally exhausting. Despite this, I do love my parents, and I try to maintain a good relationship with them.Ever since I moved, my mom has asked when she can come and visit. For those of you who have uprooted your life and moved hundreds of miles away, I’m sure you understand how stressful this is. I had to find a new job, get my new documents in order (license, insurance, etc), unpack my entire life, find a new routine, just a never ending list of tasks to get acclimated to this lovely new place.Anyway, she has finally settled on coming to visit in April, when she’ll be able to take leave from work for a bit. We started discussing activities and places to visit, and I told her which towns nearby would be the best places to get hotel rooms in, because I’m pretty sure that there’s nothing like that in my new town, as it’s so small. I told her if there were some vacancies in town, though, I’d keep an eye out and let her know. Things got awkward at this point, because she had apparently assumed she would stay with my partner and I in our apartment. I told that wouldn’t work, and when she asked why I provided all the reasons I could think of at the moment:If she gets a rental car, she can’t park in our driveway, there isn’t room.Overnight guests aren’t allowed in our lease.My partner and I want our privacy. This is our home, and we do not want to keep overnight guests.We don’t have the room to keep her. We have one bed and one bathroom.Her response to all of these was basically “BUT I’M YOUR MOTHER!” I told her I’m sorry, but we can’t host her overnight. She also has a habit of bringing her dog along with her when she says she won’t, and my partner and I aren’t allowed any pets in the apartment whatsoever. She’s angry with me and has since been accusing me of not loving or caring about her, that I’m ungrateful and selfish, and that I obviously don’t want to see her and just moved to get away from her. She also said that if we visited, someone would host us instead of making us get a room. I told her we would get a room anyway, because again, we prefer our privacy, and I’m pretty sure my relatives don’t want to host a queer couple anyways. My coming out last year had mixed reviews to say the least.After all of this, I’m wondering if I was really being an asshole here or if my mom is just unreasonable. AITA?",

This started as a way to celebrate my grandfather's birthday, and although now he is no longer with us it is a tradition we have continued. I have two sisters, my older sister 'Lottie' (35f) and my younger sister 'Olive' (23f). Lottie has a daughter 'Rosey' (4f) from a previous marriage, and her husband has three children (8f, 10m, 12f). While she only married her husband in March, they have been together for a couple of years so her stepchildren have come to family stuff before. While she is a very involved grandmother, my mother has never considered Lottie's stepchildren to be part of the family.A few days before we were supposed to meet up for the fair, my mother messaged the family group chat to tell us she had booked us a table at a restaurant, but she had not booked enough places for my sister's stepchildren, and had only booked Rosey in to see Santa. Lottie was upset with this and wanted the booking to be changed, but my mother refused. She thought her stepchildren should spend the day with their mother, or Lottie's husband could stay home with them, as this tradition was for family only.So, my sister decided not to go with my mother. She and her husband decided on a different day to attend the fair with all of their children.Here is where I may be the asshole. Lottie asked me and Olive to go with her too, to reinforce to my mother that her stepchildren were part of the family and should be included in family activities. While I agree with the sentiment, the date she chose was a day when I already had plans with my girlfriend. Lottie asked me to cancel my plans as this outing was more important, which I disagreed with as my girlfriend was going away with her family for Christmas/New Years so this would be the last time I saw her for three weeks.I stuck to my plans and spent the day with my girlfriend. Lottie still went with her husband and their children, my mother went with some friends and Olive, and I thought everything was fine.However, Lottie completely blanked us when we tried to arrange plans for New Year's, and when she did eventually reply she told us she was spending it with the family that 'cared enough to stick up for her'. She is especially angry that I chose my girlfriend 'over my family' and that Olive still went with our mother. I had not expected this to turn into a big issue, she gave me little notice and I do not think I was unreasonable for not wanting to cancel my plans, but I think given my mother's attitude this meant a lot more to her than I initially thought. So, AITA for not cancelling my date to attend my sister's holiday tradition with her and her stepchildren?",

	"title" : "AITA for consistently asking to exchange the gifts that my brother gets me, as well as, wanting to exchange a drone he got me for Christmas? My family has called me selfish, inconsiderate, and ungrateful everytime",
	"body" : "For the past three years, my brother (25 M) and I (22 M) have exchanged Christmas/B-day gifts. We live in Canada and with the housing crisis, moving out isn't really an option. This year, he surprised me with a drone. I Spent $100 on a white Nike cap, brown Raptors Toque, Hat Organizer, and Leafs lanyard. He's always stressed about misplacing his hats and wants more that are my style.I was shocked when I opened the drone gift. I was also worried it was expensive, so I asked how much he spent. He reassured me that he spent a similar amount.However, I couldn't shake off the disappointment and anxiety, as I felt the drone wasn't something I'd use. I belive, he gets me things, he wants for himself. My brother admitted in front of me, my mom, and his girlfriend - that the gifts he buys me - are also something he can wear and use.I acted happy and grateful but my girlfriend sensed my discomfort, knowing this is something my brother would love and that I’ve never shown any interest in.Some Examples (you could skip this):He gave me bright Red 550 New Balances. He already has the exact same for himself in blue “he liked both so much and couldn’t pick so he got the red ones for me” - I later asked for a receipt to make an exchange, no receipt and he has worn them.One b-day he gave me Purple Vans with a “One Piece” design (this is his favourite anime). I enjoy the show but I've NEVER worn anything like this (I have a very minimalistic style, I can provide a link to the shoes). This 100% was something he wanted for himself (no receipt provided). At the time, I felt really bad bc I knew I wouldn't wear the shoes and he would notice. I thanked him for the gift. Later I told him how I felt and asked him to keep the vans (he was very happy and wears them everyday), while I kept my gift to him - a custom “One Piece” poster of his favourite character (he wanted posters for his room this year).For the past 3 years it's just been more of the same. I feel he doesn't put in effort, I ask for a receipt, and my family calls me ungrateful. While my gifts are always so personal to him.My girlfriends noticed this trend and how increasingly rude he's been with me over the years. I don't feel close with him - like she does with her younger brother (4 years apart, we're 3). My gf asked me to make this post bc I've been extremely conflictedMy parents call me ungrateful. Sometimes I think my brother gets me stuff he likes, thinking I'd like it too. However, it's difficult to communicate with my brother. He reacts angrily to simple requests for advice. He says he's a responsible older brother but I don’t even feel close with him. I can give more examples of other shitty things he doesSo, am I being the asshole by always asking for a receipt? And would I be the asshole again, if I ask to return the drone? I know that it will cause an argument/greater rift between us, and how my parents would react.Edit; Thought I'd provide more context about our relationsihp and why I feel so conflicted.I want a better relationship with my brother. Recently, when I think about how he treats me, I get depressed. When I compare our relationship to my gf and her brother (or other brothers), it's night and day. I'm not sure if what I'm thinking is right becuase my family always made me feel guilty.But I've been thinking he genuially treats me like shit. Recently, he wore my suede timberland boots (that I keep in prestien condition) and put a years worth of damage on them in 1 night. This is because I wore his hat. Salt was everywhere, deep scuffs, and creases. He didn't even bother cleaning them with our salt wipes. When we reff hockey together - he yells at me/trys to embarass me in front of our boses and strangers (this only happens w/ him - reffs are supposed to have each others back). I've also I told him nuermous times to stop. Our parents have overheard our arguments and are quick to tell me he doesn't know what he's doing, or just try to get us to stop.When I try telling him how he makes me feel, he literally could not care any less. He completely dismisses/ignores me. been like this since covid. he's also so quick to anger and ingores me to my face when I try talking to him. He acts like he can't hear me (as I stand right in front of him) and continues on his phone.For so long my family always tells me how I'm not responsible, consistently giving me shit. Rarley anything is said to him and they display him as a role model. I feel like this is a breaking point for me, but I honselty think I'm being a pos for feeling upset about his gits.",

	"body" : "I (20F) am getting married this spring. My father (51M) will likely not be walking me down the aisle. We've had a strained relationship for a good portion of my life, despite him financially providing for me. My parents divorced when I was 15.Onto my dad. He works a difficult job as an executive at a tech company, and brings in at least half a million a year with bonuses. My mother works as an instructor at a local polytech, and we're well-off because of their hard work. He's been very emotionally withdrawn as long as I can remember, and has never told me he loves me or shown any affection. He's never been to a single school event, never driven me to school, never spent time with me, never showed any interest in me/achievements... and so on. Just a guy who lived in my house.My mother is, simply put, a superhero to me. She worked hard my entire life to provide me with a normal childhood and showed up to everything. She even broke her no-contact with my grandpa encourage him to attend my father-daughter events at school so I wouldn't feel out of place. She worked a 9-5, but still made me homecooked breakfast, lunches, and dinner. She tucked me in every night, called out of work to come to therapy with me, always noticed when something was wrong and magically made it better.A year the divorce, he started paying more attention to me. This coincided with him seeing a new woman (who is married with kids, and was a source of scandal in the family). This was shortly after I left an abusive relationship, where I was d. He stepped up on providing me with comfort and caring more than he ever did previously (I've had very poor mental health since I began grade school, and he never noticed, despite me having scars and being in hospitals often). He began taking a bigger parental role in my life, despite me living with my mom full time. However, his attempts were always half-hearted and I usually left feeling sour.This spring, I'm getting married to my highschool sweetheart, 20M. He's everything I've ever wanted, and knows about my relationship with my father. When I was worrying about whether I wanted him to be in the wedding party or not, he made the suggestion that my mother walk me down the aisle. I loved this idea, since she practically raised me on her own, and she was the one who also took my fiancé under her wing when we were younger.Yesterday, I had lunch with my father to invite him to the wedding, and he was surprised to hear I was getting married (even though fiancé and I have been engaged for a year, he was invited to the party but didn't attend as he was in Japan on a trip). I bit my tongue about it and let it slide, until he asked when he should arrive to walk me down the aisle. I broke the news to him that he wouldn't be the one doing it, and he got up silently and left. He has since not answered any calls or texts, even from my mom. I'm still planning on having her walk me down the aisle. WIBTA if he was only a guest?UPDATE: There is a character limit here, so the update is on AITAH.",

Like if I ask someone to watch the baby so I can shower they do but they bring the baby in to the bathroom and keep the curtain open the entire time so the baby can see me (at least 2 out of 3 times). Or if I ask someone else to make dinner, they will but they ask repetitive questions on what to do or how to do it (both my older kids do know how to cook because they took an interest in it early on in life). Any time I ask any of them to hold/keep an eye on the baby for a minute, they absolutely do but they just follow me everywhere with the baby. Saying things like \"what's mama doing?\", \"she will be done in a minute baby and then she will take you back\". And I feel psychotic because they ARE doing exactly what I asked but they just follow me with the baby the entire time OR ask me to walk them through what I asked them to do even though they can do it themselves. Kids and husband. And I have voiced this several times but I don't know if I was being too calm or less stern than I should have been because they just continue doing it. So I just stopped asking and my husband asked why I'm not asking for help anymore and I said \"because you guys really aren't helping me\". He said I'm wrong for saying that.ETA: I've been unclear. I don't ask my other kids to parent the baby. They don't change/burp/feed the baby. They are asked at most once a day to watch the baby for 10 minutes at most; when I am cooking or going to the bathroom or cleaning. I ask them to cook small meals (for themselves) maybe once a week. Something like Mac n cheese or pizza. My husband is the biggest culprit. My kids ASK to watch the baby but I never go more than 10 minutes if they do because 1. it's not their responsibility and 2. they are still kids and a lot could go wrong. I wouldn't ever force my kids to watch their siblings. They literally ask if they can and if I say \"can someone come keep an eye on the baby for a second\" they BOTH come running and fighting over who's going to. Do NOT project you parentification BS on people. That's not what this is. I don't understand how holding a baby or talking to her while she's in her swing is me \"forcing my kids to be parents\". The kids also do not watch the baby while I shower, unless their dad asks them to for whatever reason. Too much could go wrong. The showering thing is 100% my husband.",

In December of 2021 I decided I wanted to take control of my life and I quit drinking. My husband was super supportive at that time and despite me never asking him to, he stopped drinking as well. He's not an alcoholic but he did have drinking problems (not knowing limits when he did drink or making stupid decisions that even I wouldn't have made). So, we both stopped drinking together and again, I never asked him to do this.Well, we moved back to his home town 2 months ago and he started drinking again, socially. I have no issue with this. I simply didn't want it in the house and he agreed to that. He could even sit out in our garage and drink and I wouldn't care. I just physically do not want it in the house. I don't want to see it because it is still hard for me. But there have been 2-3 separate occasions where he will walk inside with an open beer and just set it down on the counter and forget about it and go open another beer in the garage, leaving his basically full beer on the counter. And I fucked up one night and I drank one. It was 2 weeks ago. It was at that point that I fully realized I would never be able to drink, even in moderation, because that one beer started what I could only describe as a \"frenzy\". I wanted more and was immediately pissed off that I didn't have more. So I talked to my husband about it and he apologized and said he would be more mindful and not bring it near the house and all went back to normal. But last night he shows up with his buddy and he had a beer with him. Set it next to the TV when he went to the bathroom (I was watching TV). He then went outside, leaving it inside. So, I dumped it. As I'm dumping it, he came inside and asked me why I was dumping his last beer and that he \"only left it for 2 fucking seconds\". I told him from now on, anything brought in this house will be dumped and if he can't respect my one request, he can leave (I own the house). I'm not spiraling because of him. Respect it or go. He says I'm being overdramatic.ETA: commenters are right. Me being an alcoholic is NOT his problem and I made it very clear in my post that I understood that. I don't care that he drinks. But he was in full agreement that he wouldn't bring it in to the house because I communicated that it was hard for me and continued to do so.

This was a relatively big purchase for me, as my family normally hand-makes gifts and cards or focuses on smaller, more personal items for holidays and birthdays. My girlfriend’s family is the opposite, and appreciates more expensive gifts, and she has gotten me very nice things in the past. Because of this, I decided to spend a bit more than I normally would to buy her the Kindle she’s been mentioning.It came a few days ago, and when I received it, curiosity and excitement got the better of me, and I took the package out of the Amazon box it came in. I broke the seal of the box the device came in and pulled the Kindle out, still in its plastic wrap. I looked at it to make sure it was what I ordered and almost unwrapped it, but eventually decided to stop messing with her gift and put everything back the best I could.I ended up mentioning to my girlfriend that I had bought her a Kindle a few days before I was planning to give it to her (this is the nature of our relationship; normally I’d try to keep it a surprise), and she asked if I had opened the box. I told her yes, I had opened the Amazon box and the box it came in, but left the actual gift in its plastic wrap.

I asked her to confirm that she wanted me to return the expensive gift I got her because I had messed with the packaging, and she said yes; in her family everything was left exactly how it was before it was opened by the recipient. I told her I wouldn’t mind or notice if someone opened the packaging for me because the gift itself is what matters, and she told me I wasn’t listening to her side, and that I should return it or give it to my sister who is an avid reader.

B and T have three kids, 13 and under.Lisa has never held a job for more than a year and a half to maybe two years ever. Becky and Teddy are in pretty much the same boat. They got pregnant pretty young and relied a lot on family and friends to get them going financially, to provide for their first daughter and now their two other kids, get them a car, etc. Becky has been a stay at home mom while Teddy has worked jobs spanning from a receptionist at a Veterinarian’s, a cell phone salesman, a DoorDash driver, a social media coordinator for a local pet store, a customer care representative at a call center, a pastry chef, and a payroll coordinator. Every single time he’s mysteriously let go or he quits because it’s a toxic work environment or the schedule isn’t working out or something - this has been going on for the entire decade plus Becky and Teddy have been a couple.When B and T were kids (teens to early twenties), I often contributed to their “fundraisers” online or donated household stuff, furniture, and sent them reasonably expensive gifts and cash for holidays and birthdays.However, I’m at the point where the constant GoFundMe asks, CashApp posts and other asks for donations on their Facebook and Instagram is not something I want to participate in. These two were at a Taylor Swift concert in Vegas earlier this year, and were literally posting the last day of the trip for donations to pay the hotel because they didn’t realize there would be taxes.A few days ago was the latest GoFundMe request which Teddy posted alongside an eviction notice from their apartment complex and a notification that his car payment is past due. This is on the heels of selling their multiple television sets, video game systems, and a whole bunch of Marvel and other collectibles and memorabilia.Usually I give them something, but I don’t want to anymore. Then Lisa texted me the payment link, following up to make sure I had seen it because, normally, I am one of the top contributors. I said that I hope things get better but I wouldn’t be donating this time. Lisa picked and picked until I said I didn’t feel like the money I was giving B and T was doing anything other than floating them until their next crisis and I didn’t feel like I was actually doing any long-term good. This turned into her telling me I should have said something sooner because I’ve set the precedent that I give them something when they ask so they’re “relying on me.”I guess it HAS been a precedent set, but I didn’t think that past behavior obligated me further. But now I don’t know and Lisa and I are on the outs. I haven’t spoken to either B or T, but I’m assuming they share the same opinion. So AITA?AITA for habitually giving in the past, setting a precedent that I’ll do so, and then suddenly stopping? Do I owe my cousins a warning?",

A lot of people were quite validating, but I think the response was overall too dramatic, but that's the internet I guess. The one comment calling me the asshole really stuck out to me though so I reached out to apologize and she invited me to her new years party to, in her words, \"Start a more casual friendship.\" I had nothing to do last night and I figured I'd go since her place was a small walk away.When I got there it was packed with people which already isn't my scene, but there were only a couple of hours until midnight and I could steal some chips and people watch for a while. I was there for about an hour before I saw my ex. She pulled me away to her room and she thanked me for coming, told me to enjoy myself and gave me a drink.Now I don't really drink often, but I can handle my alcohol pretty damn well and always have. (the legal age where I'm from is 18 don't come for us.) I figured it was in my hand already and I didn't want it to go to waste. Now when I tell you that this drink was STRONG. I mean it. I could barely taste the mixer, it was horrible in the way only straight vodka is. I ended up drinking it pretty fast so i didn't have to taste it all night, but that whatever. I'm rambling at this point, but it was a really bad drink and it got to me fast.Around 11 random people start coming up to me asking if I'm her Ex and if i still like her and what it was like to date her. Everyone and their cousin was interested in her and I's relationship suddenly and eventually someone let it slip that she was planning on kissing me at midnight.Now it was probably just a rumor or someones drunk idea of a prank but I decided I was done for the night and would rather just watch Animal Crossing fireworks so I texted her that I had fun but was leaving.Today I woke up to a million texts from her saying I shouldn't have left, that I should have spent the night if I was drinking, that it was rude to leave without a proper goodbye, that no one can leave New Years parties before midnight, and that I need to go apologize to her and her sister.AITA for leaving early? I know it was probably dumb to walk home while not fully sober, but it was just a few blocks and I'm fine, right?EDIT: I did not expect so many people to respond to this, and not as strongly as they did. To clear up a few things she and I don't talk often because I ghosted her after we broke up, I was at the party as an apology for doing so more than anything. I don't really plan on keeping too much contact with her after this, I just figured it would be better to clear the air in case I ran into her or her family.I still don't think the drink thing is that serious, but you guys are right that it was weird that she planned for me to stay overnight.Overall you have given me a lot to think about, I guess",

She's still welcome to call or visit my kids (12m, 4f, 3f) but I wasn't putting in any effort with her anymore.A month later, she sends a group text to all the kids- we need to show up at her house in 3 days to receive a check and show our gratitude.

Throughout the entire week I tried indiscreetly asking if my parents made any plans for my birthday so I could call off work and tell my friends when I'd be busy but they never brought the topic up. I even asked them outright if they had anything planned and if they didn't I'd be going out with my friends. They answered no.The night before my birthday my friends surprised me over text with tickets to a movie I wanted to see, outdoor rock climbing, and a paid dinner at this new restaurant I've been wanting to visit for a while now, everything was paid for by them and obviously I was ecstatic! I managed to get a coworker to cover my shift last minute and the next morning after i got ready to leave I was bombarded by relatives the moment I walked downstairs.Now to be clear these were aunts, uncles, and friends of my parents who I never really talked to aside from pleasantries during family gatherings, I wasn't exactly close with any of them. They had food, cake, and presents in the kitchen, and my parents were at the center. I was super touched at all the work they must have gone through to get everyone here (and the food looked delicious) and I told them I would be back before sunset. Immediately my parents got annoyed and asked me where I was going, and I told them I had plans with friends. They asked if I was just saying that to get out of celebrating with family and I told them that since they never gave any indication that they had anything planned for my birthday my friends made plans themselves, plus everything was already paid for. I tried to reiterate that I would be back before it was too late but they started yelling at me, calling me selfish for ditching family for friends and that I was a jerk for disregarding all the work they put into my surprise party. I once again tried to tell them that I had no idea they were going to invite anyone over, and if they had told me beforehand I would have been able to plan accordingly, but they said that would have defeated the purpose of a surprise party.I had to leave since my friends were waiting and if we were late our reservations to the restaurant would be rebooked, all the while my parents were yelling while my relatives watched. By the time I got home (6 pm) my relatives were gone and all the food was put away. I asked my parents about it and my mom told me I'd get the presents next year if I decided not to be selfish and put my actual flesh and blood before some 'silly friends'Aita?

So thats where everything went downhill.So like the title states im not black, but im South Indian so im a really dark brown, my skin tone is the same as Simone Ashley. My mum also has amazing skin like no wrinkles and shes in her 50’s, so I wanted to make a joke that since I have melanin Im not going to get wrinkles too. So I laughed and said im not worried because you know black dont crack and this is where I effed up.I said black because well dark brown doesn’t have the same effect. A few of my friends also giggled, but this other girl (a friend of a friend) who is white, basically called me a racist and said since Im not black I shouldn’t have said that. i basically defended myself back saying how am I racist, I didnt say anything offensive etc but we back and forth.

You can’t also scold her since she’ll just be a menace and would make a scene.A little background: when I was a teen (around 14-15), my aunt would often force me to babysit her.

At some point, it got tiring as a kid myself, I really don’t want to take care of someone who’s older than me yet behaves like a child.

She became upset, saying that it was unhealthy and odd for one person to eat a dessert meant for two. She also mentioned it might be disrespectful to the restaurant.We had a mild argument about this, and I ended up not getting the dessert I wanted.So, am I the asshole for insisting on ordering a dessert meant for two people, even though I was going to eat it alone, especially when it upset my girlfriend?",

We love nice wine but my wife and I were in more of a cocktail mood this particular night, so that’s what we ordered. The other man perused the wine list and ordered a bottle. When the server asked how many glasses, he said 4. My wife and I both had a half glass not thinking too much of it. After the first bottle was done, he ordered a second. Same thing, my wife and I both had half a glass. Then he ordered a third, but we didn’t drink any of the last one.After we got the bill, I saw the first bottle was $375, the second bottle was $275 and the third was $190. The bill was a little over $1400 and he paid with his card. Before I even got home, he had sent me a Venmo request for exactly half the bill, $706. AITA for not wanting to pay that much? I grew up with the understanding that if somebody ordered a bottle of wine for the table without consulting anybody else, it was their bottle and they could share with you if they offered. It just seems like bullshit because we maybe consumed 10% of the wine but still got stuck with half of an $850 wine bill.Curious to hear your thoughts.",

In a conversation we were having this weekend, he said that we wanted me to feel as though it was my house too, something that we were doing together, and feel as though I was able to contribute; I replied that of course I was very happy to contribute to the fair share of the bills, and that it would be great to start our life together.At this point, he said he was worried that I had misunderstood, and felt that he should be clear. He then suggested that he wants me to cover his share of the bills, and not just contribute my portion, in place of a 'rent' for living there, and so that he has to incur close-to-zero outgoings himself. I questioned why we couldn't just enter the house as equals, paying an equal share of the costs incurred as a result of living there: asking why I should 'pay his way,' and stated that I was uncomfortable in the power imbalance this would create, and that I would feel like I was 'renting off my boyfriend' and that he was trying to 'make money from me.'He questioned why his parents money should cover the cost of my \"rent,\" and claimed that I would be saving a great deal more money than if I was living in private rented accommodation (as I am now), which although is true, doesn't feel like a particularly nice position to be in, because as far as I see it, there isn't any \"rent\" to pay? At this point it was insinuated that I would be 'freeloader' if I didn'tThis argument/conversation went round and round, where neither of us could seemingly understand the others position, and ended with me feeling as though perhaps I was asking too much, and that I was trying to freeload off my boyfriend.. so tell me, AITA?",

Me, my friend and her boyfriend were all dressed in cosplay for the event as we enjoyed to cosplay during our free time together. After the event, my friend had suggested to take a simple photoshoot as it had been awhile since we’ve cosplayed together as a group. I agreed to it and my boyfriend was also okay with the idea so we headed out to a proper venue for a photoshoot.During the photoshoot , my friend’s boyfriend was trying out different ways to take our pictures. One of which was trying out the “Panorama” feature on his phone. I agreed to be the one he tries this method on and when we took a look at the results, we all bursted into a fit of laughter. It was genuinely a silly and innocent joke and I was in on laughing at how ridiculous I looked. The panorama had warped my image into looking like a default Roblox character.My boyfriend then asked if he could have the picture for himself on his phone. Initially, I thought it would be something he kept to himself as some sort of silly inside joke, so I agreed for it to be sent. I would have never agreed to it if what happened next didn’t occur at all.When it was my friend’s boyfriend turn to take pictures, I was standing next to my boyfriend when I saw my picture in a private chat with one of his own friends. At that time, I didn’t think to tell him what he did because I felt that it was funny, but after much thought, I did not like that he had shared images of me without my knowledge.After the day had ended, I decided to approach him with the situation and told him that I did not like how he was willing to act on sending pictures of me to his friends without my consent to which he responded with “I just thought it was funny”. I explained to him that I felt that it was not fair of him to be doing that as he himself had expressed how he would prefer if I consulted him on the pictures I post or send to others. I then asked him if he liked that I was passed around since he likes to do anything he pleases with my photos. He was taken aback and asked where the relation was and I explained to him again why I felt like he was breaching my trust for him.He apologised and said he wouldn’t do it again, but mentioned that I also did something like this a few days ago when I texted my friend that he was crying over a bad haircut he had. I had told him my intentions sending that message was not to ridicule him but to ask for advice instead as I was unsure on how to console him at that situation.

He mentions that none of it was with ill intentions and that he just wanted to share fond memories with his close friends about his own girlfriend.

Although we are always appreciative of the gifts we receive for our child there has always been a boundary issue with my in laws since my husband and I met which I will not go into but it’s important to note. This Christmas being our daughters first she was showered with many, many gifts majority being toys and stuff we had mentioned to our parents that she needed. We were super grateful that majority would be items that will be put to good use, since most of the gifts she received we can’t afford at the moment me being a stay at home mom and us living off of just my husbands income. this is where the boundary issue comes in. We had mentioned multiple times to our parents how we are choosing to raise our child. My husband and I both decided we would like to steer away from screen time as much as possible and opt in for more engaging activities and toys. That means no phones, no iPad and limited tv time since our little one is ONLY 5 months. Well my father in law went out of his way and bought our daughter a 65” screen tv for us to put in the room. We don’t even have enough space for a tv that big nor do we even watch tv that much ourselves to be interested in a tv that big not to mention that a FIVE month old has no business having a tv for herself. I told my husband that he’s just going to have to give his dad the gift back but my husband is refusing to since he says that it will offend him.[EDIT] there are just something’s I’d like to clarify since I’ve noticed previous comments have similar questions. No, my husband did not secretly go behind my back and ask for a TV for himself, we were both rather shocked when we saw FIL haul this thing into our living room. Yes, both sets of grandparents are aware of how we’re choosing to raise our child. At one point I did suggest my husband we swap it out with the one in our living for the occasional movie night. but unfortunately since we are currently living in an apartment there’s just not enough space hence why we also can’t just place it in the garage, etc. because we live in an apartment. As obnoxious as this might sound my FIL made it very clear to us that this is a gift for his grandkid and not a family gift which is why it doesn’t feel like a genuine gift. FIL has had a track récord of testing us as new parents. This is the same man who in summary threw a fit over a no sick visitor rule when our baby was a NB while no one else seemed to have any issues with that request. The only reason I’m suggesting we give it back is in hopes that, that be the best option as FIL can just return it and get back his moneys worth and we can forget all this even happened.",

	"body" : "I (f18) had a car that used to be my moms since I was 16. It was a 2010 and became no longer safe to drive (something was wrong with the axel? I don’t really know). The car was worth less than the amount it would have been to fix it. My parents graciously bought me a new car that I am very thankful for. They were set on this one used car that was a cheaper option and I was okay with that. While we were at the dealership to test drive, they saw a new one that we all really liked that was about $4000 more than they were planning on spending. When we got home I told them I was okay with either and I’m not gonna be picky since they are the ones buying it. They should just do what they think is right. The next week I was told I was getting the cheaper option but they came home with the new car. I was very happy and thankful that I had a car at all since I have to drive an hour everyday for work and I was ubering for the time being. They then told me they bought it in cash and SINCE they got the new car, I should pay them $500 by the end of the summer for it. That’s a bit under what I make in a week but I only work during the summer and a few weeks in the winter since I am a sophomore in college. The car is under my moms name, not mine. I am not sure if/when it will be transferred to mine but I am assuming when I’m done with college. I would be happy to pay any amount for it then since it will actually be mine. I have always paid for my own gas but they pay for my insurance. I If they had told me that the new car would cost me $500 beforehand, I would have made them get the cheaper option. I genuinely would have been fine with any car if it meant I didn’t have to pay and they knew that. I also go to school 8 hours away and as of now there is no point in me having a car on campus so I leave it at home. They also just don’t want me to bring it to school even if I wanted to since it would be a burden on my dad. I feel it is unfair for me to pay for a car when I can really only use it for 5 months out of the year. I wouldn’t mind paying for it when I am able to bring it to school since I will be the primary user. My dad also uses the car sometimes when I am at school since he doesn’t want to put miles on his. I also want to reiterate that my parents did not buy a new car out of the kindness of their hearts. It was obviously very nice of them to lend me a car at all but they got the new one because they want to show off to their friends. I am aware I am very fortunate for getting a car at all but AITA for refusing to pay for the car?Edit: the car is in my mom’s name for insurance reasons but they will switch it to my name once I’m out of school. They know I am very appreciative of the car but they wanted me to show my grate-fullness by paying. I would have been okay with literally any car that worked as I do not really care for materialistic items. They have always been into a flashy lifestyle and wanted to buy me a version of my previous car so it would look good in the driveway. I told them no since that would be ridiculous and I didn’t want to pay for premium gas. Even if I pay the $500 the car will NOT go in my name.Another edit: I know it sounds like I am super ungrateful and I am aware $500 for a new car is a great deal. That’s not the point. No one sat me down beforehand saying this is what was going to happen. I went into the whole car process under the impression I wouldn’t have to pay. That was the deal until they brought the NEW new car home. Then they decided I was gonna pay $500. If someone had told me beforehand, I would happily help out. The money is less of the problem than the fact that they sprung this on me without talking to me first. This makes me not want to pay anything.",

We are in the US so health insurance is something you have to buy. We have been on government insurance for years. Every year you have to reapply and give them proof of income. There is a time limit for when you can reapply.Since we live in the same house we all apply together but one adult could be approved and the other not based on income since we are not married. Our child's insurance would be attached to mine since I am the primary parent that handles most things child related.I checked online today to see the status of our renewal and saw we needed to provide our 8 weeks of previous check stubs. I got mine easily online and uploaded them. In my mind getting access to check stubs is simple and I've had to do it a ton of times in applying for apartments or to show proof of income for various things. It's a common ask.After I finished my documents I called child's dad and asked if he could send me his pay stubs. He straight up said \"No.\" I waited a moment for further explanation but when he said nothing else I said. \"No? You cant get your pay stubs? Its for proof of income for insurance but I guess if you cant you cant.\" He then said \" I cant do that I don't have access.\" I then said he should ask his dad about it since that's who he works for. his dad owns a legit business and he gets regular paychecks. he then says hell try and message his step mom and see if she can figure out how to get them. He sounded irritated that id even ask for this info and wasn't at all appreciative that I was taking this on (insurance business is the worst to deal with). I didn't have to help him out. I was just trying to be kind. Now I feel like why did I even bother trying?I texted him after we got off the phone and let him know id seen that his dad can also write a letter proving/confirming what he makes and his ours and that if he'd prefer he can go on the site himself and submit the information. I sent him the site link and even told him where to click to get to where he needs to submit the information. I reiterated that I am just trying to help. He just replied \"ill send it to you whenever they get it to me.\" Again no thanks or I appreciate it or even ill handle it myself. it just feels so entitled to me.I want to now text him back and say \"Never mind! You handle your own shit and ill handle mine!\" But I am afraid that when I get home he'll treat me poorly or act like I'm selfish or needy or childish because I expect common curtesy. I'm scared that he'll talk down to me even though he always says he doesn't and its actually me who treats him poorly. I don't want to be afraid to speak up but I am.

My bf added me to the group chat about a month ago, I guess as an invitation or to let me know they were all wanting to go. The chat is entirely in another language and translating 1 or 2 comments takes me 30 minutes (because they write in English characters, so I have to translate into the Asian characters by hand before I can google translate). It looked like most people wanted to go in February, enough time for me to earn 2 days PTO, but then this afternoon I found out everyone wanted a spontaneous trip tomorrow and we’d all go back home next week. I don’t have the PTO. Bf keeps saying to just take unpaid time off and that’s what the higher ups do to take their long vacations anyways. This is my first real job and it took me 1.5 years to land it after uni, so I’m hesitant to do anything that might get me fired. I asked some basic questions. Where are we staying? How and when are we going and how and when do we get back? What are we going to eat? All met with “It’s okay. We’ll figure it out.” Spontaneity is fine, though not preferred. Money isn’t the biggest issue. Based on my calculations, if I went for the only day I can go, it would’ve costed around $500. The problem for me is the timing and the language barrier. Everyone can speak English, but they prefer speaking in their Native language, leaving me feeling like a third wheel. When they speak english, it’s just to me. I’ve discussed this language barrier with bf as this isn’t my first time feeling left out and his only solution is if I just learn his language to be able to talk with everyone. For these reasons, I said I didn’t want to go but didn’t stop bf from going. Bf didn’t want to go without me and now everyone has canceled the trip because of me and kicked me from the group chat. At the end, bf asked me why I couldn’t just get along with his friends and asked why him being there with me wasn’t enough. Was I too dramatic? Should I have just gone?",

SIL also brought their new puppy, a corgi mix (cute but hyper and not yet trained) to stay with them while they were there.  It was all very chaotic and I was definitely overstimulated pretty much the moment we arrived.  This part is important because it supports why things happened the way they did later.  The dog kept jumping on my toddler and knocking him over.  MIL's house is pretty small and cramped with that many people in it so it leads to feeling like you're in the way no matter where you stand or sit.A little while later my son asks for a drink so we go to get his cup out of the diaper bag which my husband had packed.  I had distinctly asked him to pack a cup for a son on the way out the door and it hadn't made it into the bag.  I had also checked in on the way out the door and asked if we had everything.  I was kinda peeved not going to lie.  I was like \"Why didn't you pack a cup?\" Of course, he didn't know.  I sighed and we resigned to using this water bottle with a straw in it for seltzer.  Cue more interruptions and chaos with the dog and the baby combo.Husband comes back with the water bottle, opens the straw and immediate almost comical geyser of seltzer comes shooting out of the straw.  I was like \"Oh! you need to take the lid off and screw it back on with the straw up.\"  I look away due to more interruptions and cleaning up of the initial puddle of seltzer from the wood floor.

It's building pressure from the carbon dioxide being released when the straw is down and you need to put it on with the straw up!\"  He doesn't listen and makes a new puddle.I excuse myself to go to the bathroom.

SIL comes flying around the corner from the kitchen and starts yelling at me \"JUST SO YOU KNOW [Husband's name] YOU'RE NOT STUPID FOR NOT KNOWING THAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW THAT EITHER!\" I immediately apologized, to no avail and it was super awkward. After dinner, BIL, SIL and SILF go upstairs and it's kinda obvious they're talking about me.

Then I started suggesting again, and he's still not open to it. It's not a genre / taste issue, we often like similar movies, he just always wants to pick what to watch.So I told him I like the movies we watched (most of them) but I'd also like to choose sometimes, or we can just not watch a movie and do something else instead.He took this as an ultimatum, and thinks it's silly since we both enjoy the things he picked.

We already explained this to my future in laws. My fiancé has then received 3 calls from his mom and dad demanding that my FSIL be a part of my retinue.

My sister, Beth (40F), lives in another state and we don’t see her much, but she is here for the holidays, as the rest of our family lives near us, Beth is the one who moved. Beth has been here since Wednesday and after a major conflict, I don’t know if I’m acting like an a-hole.When Beth got here, we (our parents, my siblings, kids, nephews and nieces, ect) all greeted her after she was done getting settled in the hotel. We then went to our parents house for dinner.Beth was asking Paisley and Brysen about college. My husband and I love all of our kids, and accept them for who they are. Brysen has always been a very ambitious kid, even in elementary school, Brysen was elected athletics commissioner in his school elections in 4th grade and has held a similar role (like spirit coordinator) since , he plays baseball and has umpired for younger kids, is part of NHS, takes APs, has done college classes since late middle school, works at a sporting goods store, and is civically engaged ect. Paisley is a much more quiet, introverted girl, she doesn’t do sports or many clubs, she just likes to be in her room and draw, knit, paint or watch TV or TikToks. This is fine with us, we realize every kid is different with their own passions, talents, and abilities. Obviously, as one may expect from this information, Brysen is planning on applying to more selective colleges than Paisley and we’re ok with that and so is Paisley.The issue is Beth reacted to hearing all of this. She asked us why we didn’t push Paisley harder and said it was “a shame” Paisley “ruined her shot of getting into a good school”, Brysen was actually the first one to defend her, complaining about how he’s sick of always being compared to Paisley by other people, he told her to f-off. This is when she started to yell, and my mom took Brysen and Paisley away from the situation.I talked to Beth in private after she had calmed down, she demanded I make Brysen apologize, but I told her I wouldn’t and told her to apologize to him and Paisley, she said she was just telling the truth about a “dog eat dog world”, I told her to stop being an elitist prick.After this, she was quiet for the night, but when she got back to the hotel, she texted our siblings and parents what happened and now they’re telling me to apologize to her for calling her that.

	"title" : "AITA Monthly Open Forum, January 2024: Rule 1 - No Armchair Diagnoses",
	"body" : "New year, who dis?Oh! Dis Rule 1, our old friend. We’ve reviewed Rule 1 before but we had some requests to dive a little deeper, specifically with regard to armchair diagnoses. So let’s do this.As you know, Rule 1 is “Be Civil.” Armchair diagnoses, i.e. telling someone they have a mental disorder of some sort, are not civil. There’s a couple of reasons for that. One is that usually it’s clearly intended as an insult. That’s uncivil at face value, but also it’s really fucking messed up to use a condition that millions of people suffer from as an insult. Another reason is that you don’t have the doctorate needed to diagnose anyone with anything. No, put your hand down, we don’t believe you. And finally, even if you did have that degree, there’s no possible way for you to accurately diagnose anyone based on a few thousand characters in a reddit post. Which is, incidentally, why it would be unethical for qualified people to do so, which you’d know if you actually did have the credentials.So how does this play out in the comments? Claiming that “(person X) is a narcissist/autistic/etc.” is a classic example of violating this part of the rule. No matter how much experience you may have with someone in your real life that is actually (fill in the blank condition), you can NOT diagnose someone as such based on a Reddit post. You may relate your experiences to another user, but that’s about it. In short, OP isn't here for a medical diagnosis and AITA isn't here to provide it.Another common violation we see that’s related to all of this is usage of the R-slur. Yes, calling someone a “retard”, or any variation thereof, is absolutely uncivil. That includes versions such as “fucktard, libtard” or any other cross-breed word that one may dream up. There’s more info here on why this is a slur, and we’re not accepting arguments on this point. Using it will result in you being banned from this subreddit permanently and reported to reddit for hate.So why are we discussing this? We’re asking you to judge actions, not the whole person. Making a diagnosis is inherently judging the whole person. It doesn’t treat them with respect, give them an alternate perspective, or do anything to help them grow. We’re not here for you to get your jollies by insulting people, and we never will be.We always need US overnight time mods. Currently, we could also benefit from mods who can be active during peak \"bored at work\" hours, i.e. US morning to mid-afternoon.You need to be able to mostly mod from a PC. Mobile mod tools are improving and trickling in, but are not quite there yet.You need to be at least 18.You have to be an active AITA participant with multiple comments in the past few months.We'd also like to highlight the regional spinoffs we have linked on the sidebar!

We found out Thanksgiving that Im not handling things well so the team really stepped up to keep my mental health in check.Fast forward weeks before christmas MIL send text inviting us over for Christmas. Dan asked me about it and i told him \"i don't want the obligation. I don't know how I will feel that day.\" We expressed my concern and feelings. Nothing back unitl christmas eve. She texts me asking if we are coming tomorrow. I told her if i had to make a choice now then No. If i can handle things tomorrow we will call & bring food so noone is panic to make food. She lives 3.5hrs away. Explained my emtional breaking % manic expisodes that have compounded the issues im struggling with daily. That the Dr changed meds but takes time to get into the system. My world is shattered & she said well you need to get away from the memories for a day. I again told her no i just cant handle being around people right now. It too hard being functional at the moment.Christmas morning Im wrapped in a blanket w/ the pictures of my two boys crocheting a blanket to help my stress in pajamas. Its like 1pm. When no knock just entered her door code & walked right in. Saying \"she figured since we weren't going to her house that we would be cooking at home & this is usually the time when it's done so they (MIL & husband) are  here to spend time with us and have dinner.\"Literally I look at Dan & not in a soft voice said \"What the fuck is your mother doing her\". As if she wasn't even there. I lost my shit, tears were just streaming down in anger. This woman disrespected my home & my wishes to handle my grief my way. I told her to get out & never step foot in the house again. (Note I said never but im a softy) I mean never for right now.MIL leaves in & Dan starts in about how I was too hard on his. She is well in her 70s and might not have long to go, we never know. That I was an asshole for kicking her out when all she wanted to do was spend time w/ us & comfort me. I am not having it. That level of disrespect & carelessness is unforgiveable at the present time. Dan & I sat down & talked after everything quieter down & he sees why i am so hurt & upset. In turn, he said he will stand by me on my terms of when she is allowed back in the house. MIL went back pulling thw full victim card with the rest of the family. So now the rest of the family are all pissed at me saying im a bitch & asshole for breaking MIL's heart & keeping her son from spending precious holidays together. Am I the asshole?Side note: I never denied Dan from being able to go or visit anyone. He decided to stay with me so I wasn't alone.",

The city I study in is 3 hours away from my hometown. Personally I always had some sort of “extreme” attachment with my belongings and don’t like others touching my things or being in my personal space without my acknowledgement at least. Christmas break just ended and I have to return to my apartment and exam period is just about to begin. I really enjoy being alone in my apartment and before starting school and studying again I would like a few days alone to relax.This is where the problem begins. Ever since I began university my mother has been pestering me about her or my grandpa visiting but the issue is the distance is not short enough for a day trip which means whoever visits from my hometown would have to stay overnight. I wouldn’t mind this in the future but I have expressed over and over and OVER again that this a very challenging school and it’s my first semester out of 6 years so I would like to really settle in first and get into my own rythm before having visitors. My mother has brought it up anytime she can either straight up or with the excuse of wanting to clean up the house for me just so she could come even though I  have repeatedly expressed my feelings as of now.Tomorrow I am planning on going back to my apartment and I thought you know what f it and decided to ask my mom and granpa if they would like for all of us to drive down together, me and my mother clean up And then they have the rest of the day to enjoy the city. I made it clear that by Friday I want to be alone as I want to go to school and return to an empty house. This would give them all of Thursday to enjoy themselves as well as choose a time to return. They were both happy and I made it clear that I was crossing my own boundaries and making this exception because I love them both very much. All was well.A few hours earlier I was in my room when I heard my younger sister ask my mother when “they” would be returning from my city. I was initially already thrown off but even more after I heard my mother respond saying “Friday night or Saturday morning”. I immediately got up and asked what was happening when my mother said that my sister wanted to join and that they were thinking about staying longer.  I got angry and told them that she is literally breaking my boundaries that I told her not even more than a few hours ago and making plans without my presence or permission.She was ready to begin an argument but I cut her off saying the trip was cancelled and I was more than okay taking the bus alone. She began to take back her words saying we would do it my way but I’m not very trusting of her right now as I believe she can easily create this issue while over there and it wont be easily avoidable. I don’t want to risk fighting with her and embarrassing myself in my new neighborhood already.So AITAH",

	"body" : "My son (30yr), DIL (31yr) and two grandchildren (4yr and 2yr) are being evicted from their home. They had some serious financial setbacks that occurred back to back and got behind on their rent. My DIL’s sister (37yr) and her adult child (19yr), had to move in with them due to her loosing her home back in October 2023. During the time that the sister and adult child have lived with them the sister has not contributed financially at all and has been spending her money that she makes from her low paying job frivolously, she frequently posts on social media about her purchases (she is apparently quitting her job and taking a two week vacation in Florida to see her boyfriend and her other child), her adult child does not work or help out around the house at all. So now that my son, DIL and grandchildren are being evicted, my son asked if he could move in with me, I of course am willing to help them, then he springs on me that the sister and adult child need to move in too. (Side note, I had discussed with my son knowing that there was a possibility of them being evicted that the sister-in-law was not going to be able to move in too). I live in a 3 bedroom townhouse with a finished basement (that is a “great room”). One of the bedrooms is my office that I need due to being in nursing school. So essentially I have the basement and one extra bedroom. The main reason why I cannot allow the sister in law to move in is because this person has not shown that she is actually trying to get her life together and has repeatedly shown how irresponsible she is, her plans are all over the place with no actual plan, also I rent the home I live in. I have an amazing landlord, who would allow my son and family to move in but not two other adults. My son seems to think that it’s my responsibility to take them in and is angry with me now because I won’t allow it and that I’m being mean by not letting them come live with me too. He is telling me that he can’t just let them live on the streets and they will all just go to a hotel and figure it out, that they are his family and I guess I’m supposed to consider them mine, which I do, but where is the line drawn between what’s my concern and what isn’t?",

I also overheard a conversation she had with my dad, where she was wondering if my boyfriend actually cheats on me, because “it’s not possible that he loves her, she is so fat”.This whole week has been dreadful, I regretted deeply spending this week with them and I feel hurt. This morning, before leaving for the airport, she started crying and told me “you’re so intelligent and beautiful, why do you have to ruin everything by being fat?”, I got so mad and I told her “if you have to constantly complain about MY body, and have to cry because you think that I am so unlovable, then do not bother coming back to this country in 6 months to see my Masters’ Graduation”. She stopped crying and started screaming at me, calling me names and saying that I do not respect her, nor accept criticism, and most importantly that I am not thankful for all they’ve done for me. My dad agreed with her, told to me that there was no reason for me to talk like this to my mother, because she is correct and she is saying these things out of love. I reminded them both that I went through eating disorders growing up that were triggered by my mom’s behavior and constant criticism of my body. They both said that I never had an ED and that I am an asshole for talking to them like this after all they’ve done for me.Now I’m just confused and overwhelmed, AITA?",

	"body" : "So my brother (B; 31) and I (33) have had a weird relationship, sometimes in NC, sometimes talking... we went for a few years without talking, and over the last 2-3 years we have reconnected and our relationship is (was) better than ever.My partner (well, now fiance; F) and I bought a house last year and we moved in together along with his daughter (22) and my B has been visiting a bit. A few months ago he came down for a weekend and ended up staying 3 weeks...*side note - both me and my F suffer quite extreme anxiety, he is more social (we're talking panic attacks... both of us)*My parents also came down the week before to help clean, set up, see the wedding venue etc. They were all leaving the day after the party. So in total, we had my B here for a month, and my parents here also for the last week of that.B had a little tantrum when my parents arrived as he didn't want to leave our guest bedroom he had been staying in. We have a day bed in our rumpus room for him, but he thought it was unfair for them to kick him out when he had been there for 3 weeks already. He eventually conceded and ended up really liking the day bed.F had stated to me and my parents how much he was looking forward to having the house to ourselves again after such a long time. I love that he can be honest like that and that my parents appreciate it too. They totally understand that and also that it does not mean we don't enjoy and appreciate having them here and helping us - but we just need our own time too.The party ended earlyish (8 pm). Me, F and B jumped in our spa towards the end and while we were in there F asked him what time he was leaving the next day (just a general conversational question), which B responded to by asking \"actually, I was hoping to stay another night\". F (unsurprisingly) said as politely as possible, that its been a busy month and we really need some time to ourselves now. He only has a few weeks left before work starts again (he's a high school teacher), and its not personal, but does he mind still leaving the next day as planned. I didn't say anything, i let him talk, and my bro seemed fine with this (at first). However, I soon realized later that he was not. He barely spoke to me that night, and the next day he left (not early either mind you, 11 am) without saying goodbye, thankyou, anything! He walked straight past F who was just outside cleaning up, said nothing, then past me (I was in my office working - with the door open), and out to the car. I watched, hoping he would come back to say goodbye... but he left.So... aita for not letting him stay an extra night?",

Is what we’re considering ok?My younger son married his college sweetheart. They have three kids with a forth on the way. His wife’s family is extremely poor and have never been able to help financially. We cover quite a bit since there’s no help from one side. She also has multiple siblings and whatever is left in her parents estate is being split among them all. It will likely be very little.My older son’s wife’s family is of equal (if not more) wealth to us and provide for their daughter without hesitation. As such we have not given them much help since it was never needed. This DIL is not only an only child but the single member of her family in that generation. She is set to inherit from a half dozen estates as the last living relative. They also do not plan on having children.Our wills, written before either was married, were originally equal splits. With how things have gone we feel we should leave the majority to our younger. They will get next to nothing from his wife’s family and have children of their own to support. My older son will inherit more than enough from his wife’s side to equal out.We were talking about this with some friends and they said to be prepared to cause tension by treating our sons differently.

	"body" : "A little premise: me (29F) and my sister (26) still live with our parents in a two-storey house that used to be a duplex. On the upper floor there are the bedrooms and a bathroom, on the lower one there are the kitchen, the dining and living room, another bathroom and our parents' wardrobe.Now, I don't like celebrating New Year, largely because I'm an autistic introvert and Christmas celebrations leave me drained. Every member of my family knows this, my friends know this, even my coworkers know this, so everyone knows better than to try and invite me for anything. So I just spend New Year quietly on my own and keeping an eye on my family's dog - he's scared of fireworks and needs someone to reassure him.That is still the plan this year, but yesterday my sister started complaining about it to me: since our parents decided to go to our uncle's lakehouse for the celebrations, our own house is free, so she invited her boyfriend over. And she wants me to leave too.As I said, our house has two floors, so I offered to simply mind my own business on one while she and her boyfriend take the other. I'm even willing to sleep on the couch in the living room for the sake of leaving them alone. But she still complains that I'm leaving her with no privacy and that she can't stay alone with her boyfriend at his house because he too still lives with his family.I think I've been pretty reasonable and I think she hasn't given me one single good reason why she needs the whole house for herself and her boyfriend. Our parents too got dragged in this discussion and they're both on my side, but I do find myself wondering if my sister doesn't have some reasons: after all, I would still be in the house and I guess she may feel guilty about basically ignoring me for the evening? Or her boyfriend - a really sweet guy - could possibly try to involve me in the celebrations and she fears that would ruin their evening.Anyway, the point is: will I be the asshole if I don't vacate our house for my sister and her boyfriend on New Year?UPDATE: My sister gave up: I ate dinner with her and her boyfriend and now I'm up in my room playing the Switch with a Doctor Who episode as background and my dog is hiding his head against my side.

Yep, Emma.I dropped some hints in our group chat. You know, general stuff about sticking to the plan without directly pointing fingers. But Emma just shrugged it off.Finally, I had enough. I confronted her, trying to keep it chill. Explained how her actions were messing with the apartment dynamics. Emma, though, went full defense mode. Accused me of being uptight and controlling. She even brought up some excuses about being busy and forgetting. Classic moves.After that, things got even more awkward. She'd give half-apologies, saying she'd try to do better, but it felt empty. One time she blamed it on a hectic work schedule, another time on forgetfulness. It became a cycle, with me confronting her, her making excuses, and the tension in the apartment building up.Is it so hard to just ask to borrow stuff and/or at least give it back in time? Is it so hard to just clean when everyone else is doing it too?

	"body" : "Wow I did not expect this to blow up.First off, so many things have happened since this post, so I want to cover all basesFirst off, thank you everyone for your support and help for making me realize that I am not the a-hole. Many of you have great points of knowing music and what songs are appropriate for vocal ranges. I did theater from 14 til 22 and had taken vocal lessons. I even had a band in HS that was just for fun.Secondly, many of you may be wondering if I cut Travis off in the wake of this. And the short answer, no. Yes he was a major Richard to me, and said many harsh words, but we went through the runt of it in life when it really counted. I know many people cut off friends when it’s clear they don’t want you, but I’m more of a, “just let me know when you are free to talk” person, not to everyone, but the people I love.I went to Travis’ place, with Taylor as mediator, to finally attempt to squash this feud. It was lengthy, but what sold the deal was this statement. “T, Ive known you since kindergarten. We’ve been through stuff no other duo has. And you know that I love Taylor as my own sister. Do you really expect yourself to believe that I would ruin your guys’ special day over this?” That really made him wake up. He apologized. Apparently, and I genuinely didn’t know this, this was his Taylor’s and her sisters’ favorite song. When she died from a stroke, Taylor was devastated. Travis made the song a new memory with the proposal, and the expected walk down song and was planning a surprise honor for Taylor’s sister at the ceremony. When that didn’t happen, Travis went into a deep anger when his plan didn’t go through. I’ll admit I had told him that I was filling in for the singer, I didn’t tell him that I was changing the song until the quick rehearsal before letting people in. He realized that I truly didn’t know this and apologized. We are good nowThird and final update, I’ve been asked to consider singing for weddings. And I’m going to be. However, like I said, I’m not a professional singer. So I’m only doing it for close family/friends weddings. I got asked to do one for my other friends for this summer!!Thank you all!",

Apparently she had mentioned to my dad she was craving meatloaf offhand a few weeks back, and that is what my mom made her the first night she stayed!!So anyways, cut to tonight. She drank the last of her favorite alcohol last night - Glen Livet. Now for as long as I can remember, my parents have gotten a bottle for her in preparation for her visit. I suppose this time they just forgot? Not sure. So as my dad is fixing her a beverage of some other alcohol, she turns to me on the couch and says all huffy “I can’t believe he didn’t get a bottle of glen livet for me”. And I said “oh, I thought I saw a new bottle on the counter yesterday” and she said (again all huffy) “no, there was like half a drink left”.In response I say, “well geez we are all human, I’m sure they just forgot”. And her response was “well when they come to my house, I have all the alcohol for them” and starts listing everything. And I say, “I am sure it was just an oversight, how many times have they forgotten it before?” She says “I usually buy it” (NOT TRUE. My parents usually always buy her a bottle.)So I finally tell her that if she is going to complain like that, she just shouldn’t come. I think it was a bit harsh, but I was taken aback by her ungratefulness and lack of empathy. This is just one example, but in general she seems to have the mentality that the world should revolve around her. She definitely was annoyed, and possibly hurt, that I said that, but she’s always making comments like this every year and it finally got to me. To me, if I am a guest in someone’s house, you don’t get to complain about anything. AITA?",

Everything is gone. I have let his probation officer know, and have filed a police report for damaged property. This was my final straw with him.At his new job, he has been reportedly flirting/hooking up with one of his coworkers.

I told her everything that he has done and how he is an alcoholic and is a frequent drug user.She had no idea about any of it, let alone he had three kids and was in a five year long relationship. She proceeded to tell me she had already gotten a weird feeling from him when he called her over 100 times a few night ago at 3am.

Rita has no idea and basically says her and bf will either wing it or just figure it out when the time comes. She's made it crystal clear though that her future does not involve higher education.

My husband and I refused.At first, my sister and brother-in-law asked us nicely, but when we politely declined, they started kicking up a fuss, arguing that my husband and I have no proper reason to refuse since the both of us are able-bodied, mentally capable, childless, financially stable, and otherwise unoccupied adults. All their other family members either have children of their own or are not able to babysit due to various financial/health reasons, and Mary and Bob do not trust babysitters. So, since our only excuse was that we didn't want to, Sam and I were the only ones who could babysit their kids. Plus, we are family, so that would be a nice thing to do.My husband and I told them that we would be happy to babysit their kids for a few hours (we had done that many times before), or, at most, a few days, but a week was far too much. Sam and I both tolerate kids (we love our family though), but we don't like spending time with them very much, which is why we chose to not have children of our own. Therefore, a week with two young children would be very strenuous for us. We also both have full time jobs, and I was in the middle of an important project at the time my sister and BIL asked us to babysit. On top of that, Mary and Bob wanted to go a week before Christmas and come back on the 24th, a time period which happened to coincide with their children's winter break, meaning that the kids would be at home 24/7 with no one to care for them. Therefore, we would be forced to either use money out of our own pockets to hire a babysitter to babysit the kids we're supposed to be babysitting (and, again, Mary and Bob don't trust sitters), or one or both of us would have to take the week or parts of the week off. Both options were clearly unfavorable for my husband and I, so, we declined.To put it plainly, we refused simply because helping would make us uncomfortable, which, when phrased like so, sounds very b*tchy.

Now the whole family is calling us cruel and lazy and saying Sam and I ruined my sister's anniversary. Am I the @$$hole?UPDATE/EDIT/MORE INFO:Mary and Bob asked us in May, and this argument went on for months.Mary and Bob don't hire babysitters anymore because they caught one drinking on the job.They asked other family members, but they all declined.They cancelled their vacation in late November.Both my husband and I have very high-paying jobs and a lot of pto.Our house has 4 guest bedrooms, so there is plenty of room for more people.Also, thank you all for your comments.

	"body" : "Our houses sit on a hill right next to each other, where our backyards are the high point and the land slopes down to our front yards. My house also sits much higher than his, even though they are only about 25 feet apart. The water from my roof goes directly to his property. His house also sits in a bit of a bowl. His land rises toward the front of his house before dropping off again, effectively trapping all the rain water right around his house.Last year his basement flooded completely. In an effort to help, I had new gutters installed on my house. The leader goes into what I thought was an existing dry well. Apparently, it is only a small catch basin that does not hold much water. In major storms the catch basin overflows and we are back to the water going directly to his house. Now his basement flooded again. He wants me to rectify the problem. He does not have French drains in his basement and said he does not want to break up his floor to install them. His property really needs to be regraded, but it would be incredibly difficult and expensive. It would be difficult to get machinery there and he would likely have to destroy his driveway.I could have a new dry well installed in my backyard to handle the overflow from bad storms, but doing it correctly would be a real financial hardship. It just seems a bit unfair. Why should I have to bear all this cost when he is unwilling to do anything to improve his own situation. Even if I install the dry well, there is no guarantee that it will solve the problem.AITA if I tell him I'm not willing to spend any more money to fix his flooding issue?",

It distracted me from my workout and interrupted my zone out time.I tried gently explaining to Jess that working out is very personal time for me and I have a focused routine when I'm at the gym alone. I said we could certainly do a weekly yoga class or something else together, but I don't want to change my gym time.Jess got offended and said family should workout together and I'm excluding her. She claims she has been looking forward to be members at the same gym so we could motivate each other. I suggested alternatives, like yoga, hiking or running together on weekends, but she insists on joining this specific gym.My husband thinks I'm being selfish and should just let Jess sign up and work out with me a few days a week.

Now patently there is nothing wrong with wanting to leave a marriage if it is irreparably broken. However, I am sure that would most would agree that there are proper ways and means of doing it. My dad just upped sticks and left, giving my mum no explanation. He refused to go to therapy. Not long afterwards he had a new girlfriend. He claims that there was no overlap. However, after he left, it transpired that he’d had a seven-year affair with someone else in the 90s, which I had no idea about. He doesn’t exactly have the best track record generally so it’s hard to believe him. He was also pretty horrible to my mum around the time of his leaving. About a year before, my mum was undergoing treatment for breast cancer and he was so unsympathetic, often dropping her at appointments and then leaving her alone to get the train to work. His job is such that he could have been way more flexible, especially under these circumstances.Anyway, fast forward to the present day and he is still with this woman. In fact, I overheard that they are going to get married. I know he wants me to get to know her. However, my mum who is still alone is unhappy at the prospect of me playing ‘happy family’ with this woman, especially after she called my mum a ‘lazy cow’. My mum is a very fragile woman. In fact, she’s had a history of abandonment by everyone, including every boyfriend/husband, brother and parents. Despite that, she is the most loving person you could ever imagine. She has supported me more than anyone in the world, including through some of my darkest moments, and I am forever grateful. I feel that I owe it to my mum to be loyal. Besides, she never wronged my dad.AITA for not wanting to meet my dad’s girlfriend?Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!",

I don’t mean a bit of dust and clutter - I’m talking years of grime and dirt that has built up. Layers of dust everywhere. Every surface in the house, from counter tops in the kitchen, light switches, walls, floors - all of it is filthy. For the record, I’m not a germaphobe or a clean freak. Cobwebs everywhere, detritus on the floors that never get vacuumed. Don’t get me started on the bathroom. It’s revolting. I was so disgusted last year that at night when everyone had gone to bed, I asked my partner to get me some cleaning spray and I cleaned the toilet and the sink myself, just so that I could feel somewhat comfortable brushing my teeth and using the toilet. The bedroom we sleep in has the carcasses of dead bugs and dust bunnies all along the baseboards. I feel repulsed eating food there as I know it is being prepared in an unclean kitchen. Ironically, I won’t shower there, because the shower is so gross. I just give myself a good scrub at my house before we leave and make sure to pack my deodorant.I have brought this up to my partner before.

This year I found myself completely fed up with this situation. On the drive home, I brought it up again. I offered to rent a car for next year (we have one vehicle) and I would drive up Christmas morning and then home after Christmas dinner. I would miss my MIL’s birthday dinner the day before, which isn’t really anything special (just a cake, my partner doesn’t get her a gift). I also offered to host them at our house instead on Christmas. I told him that his expectation that I should put up with this was unreasonable and unfair. He got very upset and we had an argument with no resolution on this matter. He thinks I should make this sacrifice for his sake and that I’m being a “princess”.

There is something I would like to address before getting to the update. There a few lengthy threads about how Ashely must be using weaponized incompetence since she failed her driver's test several times. The written part she has passed, its the driving section that she fails all the time. You see she has ADHD and is on the spectrum so she tenses up a lot when she gets behind the wheel. While her anxiety has gone down in recent years, driving is still a sore spot.Now, many of you (including me) believed that this was all just financial abuse and she wanted control of my money. Well we were all wrong.Yesterday I went out to take care of a few errands and when I came back Ashely came to me with tears. It had looked like she had been crying for a long time. She apologized for getting angry at me and for avoiding me. She said she knew my old car was on its last legs and knew a new one was necessary. She also understood that there would be plenty of money left. Ashely admitted she wasn't mad about the money, it was actually the memories of my old car. She only mentioned the wedding because she didn't want to sound pathetic and seemed to be the most obvious choice.You see last year we had a 14 year old German Shepherd that we sadly had to put down after she got cancer. Ashely had her ever since she was a pup and loved her very much and so did I. Ashely was an absolute mess after that. We never took down her crate and had placed her old blankets, pillows as well as her leash and collar in it.What does this have to do with my car? I still had her old blanket in my old car whenever we took her out. Some of her fur was also still in the back seat as I almost never vacuumed the back. Ashely was afraid of forgetting her and that's why she wanted me to keep the car.I assured Ashely that I love her and that I loved our dog. If it meant anything, I took the blanket out of the car which she asked me to place in the crate. I had donated my old car but the tow truck won't be there to pick it up until tomorrow so she asked to see the old car one last time.So we drove to the lot and she had a tearful goodbye over it. I took her out to eat after that to get her mind away from it.So there you have it everyone. This was never about money.",

Both work & are equal income earners.My in laws, who I only met a few times before our son was born, live in Israel and had been very nice- although there is a language barrier. After our son was born, my MIL came to stay with us for 6 wks, which we were grateful for, but due to the language barrier, her presence was awkward and difficult at times. MIL started becoming overbearing, commenting on how our son was dressed, hovering while we changed the diaper, etc. MIL wanted the baby to call her Maw Maw (which means grandma in Hebrew)-  I politely said no to this bc it can be confusing in English being too similar to Mama. After her visit I felt a bit traumatized, but was still thankful for the help.When the events in Israel started this year, my MIL & FIL came to the US to stay with us for safety. This is when things start unraveling. So far here is what I’ve experienced during my in-law’s 2.5 month visit:FIL constantly comments about how I should cook & clean more, perform more “wifely duties” (even though I work and earn the same as my SO)MIL enters mine and my SO’s room without knocking MULTIPLE timesMIL cannot watch the baby for more than a couple hours bc she is too tired, so we still take him to daycare. Side note my FIL won’t help since “it’s a woman’s duty”The in laws and SO don’t speak English in front of me, so I feel very left out in most conversationsThe in laws do not have a car so they never leave the house and when they do, they need to be drivenMIL has reorganized the whole house including where we keep our private intimate itemsMIL didn’t take either mine or my son’s food allergy seriously and 2 separate times added ingredients to our food that caused reactions (luckily these  events didn’t lead to hospital visits)MIL taken over the kitchen, critiques me all the time, etc.To make matters worse, MIL dotes on SO so he has regressed a child state, where he lets her do everything for him & he hasn’t helped with our son or household chores. He owns a growing business, so he has been working late on weeknights and weekends; which leaves me home with FIL/MIL the majority of the time. My SO also sees nothing wrong with the situation, and in his eyes his mother can do no wrong.My in laws have other family in the US: another son with 3 kids, & MIL has 2 sisters. They have plenty of money and resources, so they are not staying with us for any money related issues. They have visited their other son for 4 days during their 2.5 month stay with us, and I’m told my MIL’s sisters will not allow them to visit due to a separate situation where they overstayed their welcome.At this point I want our guests gone and want to feel comfortable in my home again.

I don't want to dwell on this topic for a long time, so I'll just say that I'm undergoing examinations.So, the main conflict began on New Year's Eve. In my country, Christmas is not particularly celebrated, December 31 is the main holiday. This year I celebrated it for the first time without my family: my girlfriend and I went on a trip. My mom (F40) and I were separated by a time zone, and her year 2024 came a little earlier than mine.Mom was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, which has always made her a little overprotective. A few hours before the new year came, I went to sleep for a while. At this very time, mom had already moved on to 2024 and wrote me a message congratulating me.I didn't reply to this message for about 20 minutes. Mom was worried that something had happened to me, wrote me a million more messages, and finally called. The phone screamed in my ear. If I am woken up ahead of time, it will absolutely provoke a migraine attack, and my whole family knows about it. I woke up and convinced mom that everything was fine. I spent the rest of the holiday with a hellish migraine.The next day, late at night, when I went to bed, mom texted me and said that she had checked the weather forecast in the city where we are, and she was worried that it was too cold here. Again, I didn't see this message because I was already asleep. Again, mom wrote about twenty messages to me and a few more to my girlfriend, and then she started attacking our phones with calls, because she decided that we froze to death.Finally, today she started calling me at seven-thirty in the morning because I hadn't answered her cat's picture for about an hour. I woke up already feeling like some dwarf had planted explosives in my head. Even now I can literally feel my head throbbing and I'm sick of migraines. I wrote my mom a polite, but passive-aggressive message, where I reminded her that I had asked her a million times not to call me at night or early in the morning because it physically hurts me, that I am an adult and can live for several hours without her control, and that, finally, now I will just turn off my phone at night and reply to her messages when it is convenient for me, and not at any time of the day, as it was before.She texted me (I quote): \"I'm sorry, I won't write to you anymore\" and stopped responding to my messages. My brother says that she is offended by me, and now it seems to me that I should have been more tolerant of her. She has never behaved so anxiously before, and I think this is due to her tendency to overprotect and the fact that I finally started the separation process.AITA?",

Katy refused, and said that she's concerned the country they're going to is unsafe. This caused multiple arguments between Laura and Marcus, as Laura wants to go on the vacation without Elle and she can just stay with her mom.Eventually that is just what they did.

She explained that she and her mom had a massive argument and she can't handle being around her right now. She said that one of her younger stepsiblings (F13) used her laptop without asking and had downloaded a virus onto it while trying to download minecraft, causing her to lose a lot of very important schoolwork that was assigned over the break.I let Elle inside and I contacted Katy. We spoke on the phone and she said she's okay with Elle staying with me but asked me to encourage her to go home. I then texted Marcus to let him know what happened and he told me that Elle should go home to her mom. I responded and told him Elle really doesn't want to go home and Katy is okay with it, he left me on read.Elle ended up staying with me for the rest of the vacation and we had a lot of fun together. When Marcus, Laura and the kids got back, Marcus was not happy with me. He said I've been \"rewarding Elle for sh*tty behavior\" and that she can't run away to my house whenever she's had a squabble with someone. We had a long conversation and i made the point that Elle is going to be an adult very soon and he could be jeopardising their relationship. Marcus told me that's his problem not mine and I am not her parent, and he doesn't want his daughter to think the world revolves around her. AITA?",

She told me to “suck it up and go” because my boyfriend is such a busy man so he shouldn’t be disappointed. I didn’t go, and he really wasn’t disappointed. He came over and took care of me. My mom didn’t talk to me for two weeks after this.She’s continued basically telling me to give him whatever he wants because “this is a once in a lifetime man for people like me”. Whatever that means. I find her new behaviour weird because she’s never done that with any of the guys I’ve dated so I asked about my own happiness and she basically said my happiness doesn’t matter because “this isn’t a regular joe”. He literally is though…She told me it’s better to cry in an aston than a ford (which I have had for 4 years). I’m not a car person all I care about is it gets me from point a to b so this meant nothing to me and I let her know it.She’s only met him once but referred to him as a “high value man”. Can someone explain what this means because I still don’t get it lol?I finally told her off when she basically told me to “ditch the feminist agenda” and go grovel and give my boyfriend sexual favours when HE was in the wrong. My mom waffled about how I should be playing the long game, I should keep him happy so I don’t have to sign a prenup and things like that. I couldn’t control my laughter which is rude but I just found it so ridiculous. I had to laugh. After I composed myself I firmly told her to stop giving me gold digging tips as she’s a failed gold digger herself, I firmly reiterated that I don’t *need* this man I *want* him. I don’t need tips on how to get him to buy me expensive jewellery or pay my rent, I have a job and I’m happy living within my means! Just like all my other exes I will leave when I notice a red flag. She hung up and hasn’t spoken to me in two weeks.My dad called to call me an AH because I could’ve been nicer and less blunt with my mom but for weeks I really wasn’t getting through to her when I was gently telling her I didn’t need to do all that.",

	"body" : "Background:I’m a German national/citizen, but I’m biracial.Dad is German: blond, blue-eyed, white.Mom is Asian: brown skin, brown eyes, black hair.I resemble my mom, so I do NOT look like Claudia Schiffer, Heidi Klum or Diane Krüger.Due to my parents’ jobs, I grew up across different continents and speaking 5 languages. Proficiency in multiple languages is also necessary for my job.I currently live in America and the usual reaction, upon learning I’m German, has been: “You don’t have a German accent AT ALL” or “I thought you were American, you sound American”.Takeaway: I am not a tall, blonde, blue-eyed woman with a heavy German accent.The problem:My friend Dave hosts game nights. A regular attendee is Jennifer (note: I am only acquainted with Jennifer via Dave’s game nights.) Jennifer’s dad was in the military and was stationed in Germany, so she spent a few years there. Since it’s December, she got onto the topic of the German Christmas markets (which I also adore) and other German things. All was fine until she mentioned that the German national anthem is racist: she was referring to “Deutschland, Deutschland über alles, über alles in der Welt\" (\"Germany, Germany above all, above all in the world\"). I corrected her that after World War II and the fall of Nazi Germany, the third stanza has been used as the anthem, which goes “Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit für das deutsche Vaterland\" (“Unity and justice and freedom for the German father country”). In modern Germany we do NOT use the “Germany above all” anymore.We argued. She questioned who I was that I dare correct her and I said “Because I AM German”. Of course she hits me with the “But you don’t LOOK German” and “You’re not a REAL German”. She insisted I was lying and wanted proof. I don’t carry around my German passport on the daily for obvious reasons, but I had my Personalausweis (German ID) and Führerschein (German driver’s license) with me. I do keep copies of important documents on my OneDrive, so I showed her a scan of my German birth certificate. Essentially, I went “Yes, Jennifer, I am, in fact, a ‘REAL’ German and what you said about our national anthem is factually incorrect.”Now she insists I “tricked” her into “humiliating” herself and she has told Dave she won’t come to game nights anymore unless I publicly apologize for “concealing my true identity”.I take offense to that, because “tricking her” implies I have been actively and deliberately trying to deceive her, which I have not. I don’t think I have anything to apologize for: I never pretended to be American, I just spoke English how I always do. When somebody asks where I’m from, I always say Germany.In my opinion it’s not my fault she assumed I was American. It’s also not my fault I’m not a 180 cm tall blonde or otherwise ‘obviously German-looking’. I guess it is my ‘fault’ for not having a German accent (?) but I don’t think that requires an apology, either.AITA?EDITED: I added paragraphs",

I was talking right in front of mother and OS and I told her that as it was her house, she gets the final say so she should kick him out and sever ties because he's irredeemable.Mother is kind, too kind, and after the loss of dad she has tried to keep the family together so my words (in anger, I admit) carried a combative edge.He went on to say that I was being cruel and callous for suggesting he be homeless over the holidays.

She has the mentality of a kid and always spent tons of money on dumb things instead of trying to fix her life.

This is because he will fall in love with a TV show, character, singer, or a an actor, and become them.For example, when he was younger he fell in love with spiderman, he wouldnt answer to anything but peter parker no matter what u did. He took a picture of andrew garfield from his laptop and u could see his reflection in the computer screen with the flash on LMFAO. He has also become justin bieber, and the flash in the past too. Usually someone would find a hole in his story and then it would all come undone and he just becomes himself again.This in itself was never really a problem, but recently he has fallen in love with kpop, and there is a famous singer that is about 26 years old, so he is now 26 years old too (in reality he is 16). This is a big problem when he interacts with people, girls especially. He has told multiple girls around his actual age that he is 26 and he has a crush on them.People believe him because when they question his date of birth, he has an answer. It is so believable because he literally has an explanation for almost any question thrown his way.Obviously alot of people have gotten upset at my aunt, and our family for allowing him to behave this way as an \"adult\" when in reality he is just a kid and he's just expressing his feelings.I hang out with him a lot and Ive finally found a way to break his character. He has an older brother who is only 24, so whenever I catch him lying about his age I ask him how old his brother is and he answer 24, then I ask who is older to which he replies his brother, then finally I ask him how old he is and he says 26, then he has a brain fart and then sits there for a bit and then finally admits hes lying.I dont know why, but he still hasnt caught on to my trick and so now whenever I need to confirm his age with a parent or something I just use that exact script and all is good.People are saying this isnt the right way to deal with his delusions, some people are calling me a jerk for making him look stupid like that and trying to embarass him.Im just his cousin, I do what I can.

	"body" : "My gf Lisa (27F) and I (28M) have been dating for two years and discussing about moving in soon. The main disagreement we have is about her dog, Coco.Lisa has had Coco for six years before we met her, so needless to say they are very attached to each other. I’ve never been a pet person, I’ve just never had one growing up and I also migrated from a country where there are a lot of stray dogs that just coexist with us, they’re not as adored or treated as part of the family as much as the Americans do. However, Coco is a small dog and Lisa loves her, so I’ve also taken on a caretaker role with Coco, such as buying her food & treats, cleaning up after her, walking her, etc.The main problem I have with Coco is having her on the bed every night when I sleep over at Lisa’s house. Every single night she will snuggle her way into sleeping in the middle, and usually kick me off the bed by slowly edging me out, getting aggressive when I try to move her. Every single time she hears a small noise in the house she will jump off the bed using my chest as a launch pad (a few times every night) which will wake me up. Half the time I’ve slept over at Lisa’s, I always end up sleeping on the couch. Having sexy time with Lisa is always an issue for us because Coco will jump on the bed every chance she gets, and when we ask her to step down she just stands there and stares, which is kinda weirds me out. When we put her outside the bedroom, she will bark/wail all night until we let her back in. Imagine trying to do it with a small dog running around on the bed every few minutes and hearing her wail loudly outside the door when we kick her out, it usually kills the mood fast. Coco also tends to get very aggressive at random times when I get physically close to Lisa, so I usually have to be very careful not to make sudden movements around Coco (one time she bit me when Lisa was tickling me so I bear hugged her and tackled her to the sofa jokingly. Another time she bit me again when Lisa dropped a large box in the kitchen and I ran in from the other room to see if she was ok) Lisa is used to everything since she’s had Coco for a long time.I am completely okay with not moving in together mainly because of Coco and I like having a place to myself where I can sleep peacefully all night, but my lady is basically getting mad I don’t want to move in and insists on us getting a place together. I told her that she either let Coco live at her mother's (5 mins walk away from where our new house will be) or I wont move in with her. I genuinely can’t imagine having to sleep on the couch every night in my own house or having to watch my back every time I want to hug my girlfriend if we were to move in. Lisa thinks I’m being the biggest douche for saying I won’t move in with Coco, but I’m just mostly concerned about my sleep and since Lisa is always against disciplining Coco, so I don’t think it’s that absurd for me to not want to move in unless my condition is met.",

Everything seemed to go according to plan until two months before the wedding when my SIL asked me if the kids should have two dresses for two entrances (wedding ceremony & dinner reception). I told my SIL that the kids will only have one entrance, as our flower girls, during my wedding ceremony. My SIL looked upset and said \"they MUST walk during the dinner reception too.\" Note that my wedding ceremony and dinner reception was at the same location and the wedding aisle was long (85ft long) so it takes some time to get from one end to the other (especially for kids).I am not the confrontational type, so I asked my husband to tell his sister that her daughters will only walk down the aisle once. My husband agreed and told his sister. My SIL disapproved and said to my husband that he is the kids' only beloved uncle and that her daughters will never get a chance to be flower girls again.I thought everything was sorted out... until the big day. The wedding ceremony went as should and the flower girls were so beautiful; however, when the dinner reception time came and my husband and my entrance to the dinner reception was about to happen, the SIL inserted her kids in front of us with fresh baskets of rose petals. The SIL never told me nor my husband about this entrance.I was blindsided. Turns out that my SIL went behind my back and told my MOH to tell the wedding MC (emcee) to announce the flower girls first to the dinner reception. The flower girls entered the dinner reception laying out a fresh set of rose petals down the aisle once more. While I was surprised, I was not angry (nor sad) because it was a special day and I did not want to let bad emotions ruin the day. I was also going to let the MC introduce and thank the flower girls during the reception anyways, so I did not mind.This quickly changed when my SIL planned a surprise dance by the daughters in the middle of dinner as a gift to us. The MC once again announced the flower girls and they started dancing down the aisle onto the main stage again. So, all in all the kids \"walked\" down the aisle not once, not twice, but three times! My husband and I were supposed to have our first dance during this time, but instead her daughters danced on the stage, while my husband and I had our first dance on the side...After the wedding I told my husband how upset I was at his sister and said she was trying to make the day about her kids. I confronted my SIL about this, but she shrugged it off and said that they were just kids and I am being a bridezilla/an a-hole.

RSV/COVID/flu is pretty bad where we are, and the local NICU is at capacity.My husband and I have different opinions on precautions. I’m admittedly overly cautious and dealing with PPA (which I’m open about) and would honestly have had no visitors for 2 months if I had my way. He would have preferred basically no precautions.Our compromise was no visitors for 2 weeks to let me heal (which I bent for him because his grandparents are snowbirds and were leaving the country), the visitors that we allowed after that needed to be vaccinated, and we wouldn’t attend any Christmas gatherings and would lay low for a week after to let any illnesses that spread rear their heads.I found visits exhausting. They always overstimulated Oliver and disrupted his feed/sleep schedule. He would be cranky for days after and I’d get no sleep.MIL didn’t take the “no gatherings” plan well and insisted on visiting us for Christmas Day. To her credit, she held her big gathering (without us) a week before. But all parties obviously miscommunicated, because I was envisioning a quick drop in for some pictures. Instead, they invited SIL and brought a whole turkey dinner to enjoy at our place. It was a nice thought, but I was overwhelmed and felt a little put out.SIL has an active social life (pubs, etc.) and I didn’t want her holding Oliver. To avoid singling her out, we simply said we’d prefer no one held Oliver. Not to mention, at the last visit, MIL failed to mention she had just visited a nursing home that was in active outbreak until she was already holding Oliver. MIL was disappointed, but hovered over top of me the whole time touching him anyways.In order to avoid a cranky baby for the next 2 days, I decided I would stick to Oliver’s schedule. I’d go to the nursery to feed him, pop back out to socialize, and within 5-10 mins he’d want more food (growth spurt).After an hour, it was time for his nap. MIL wasn’t giving me a lot of space, was grabbing him, taking pictures and trying to FaceTime people with him on screen…  so I was delayed getting him down by 15-20 mins. This made him cranky, and I tried for ages to get him down before giving up and letting him contact nap on me. Since his nap is 2-3 hours, they had gone before we came back out.MIL is disappointed she didn’t get to hold Oliver or see him much. My husband thinks I should have just kept him up and bottle fed him in the living room (we are still new at breastfeeding and have worked really hard to ditch the bottle. I didn’t want to backtrack our progress).My husband feels guilty because of all the work they put into the food and they brought a bunch of presents. He thinks we ruined their Christmas.

My husband told them no, come on up, it’s your Christmas come spend it with us, we want you here. So they decided to come up.Both families celebrate on Christmas Eve, we discussed still going but only a few hours, which he agreed. He proceeded to go  the entire Christmas Eve, from 3:30-midnight. I’m upset because that’s not what we agreed on, we agreed to only go for a few hours. We argued about it and he said “I’m going to spend Christmas with my family, it’s only 1/2 a day!”  I took a separate car, went and returned, but he kept our son there. He even told his family it was our Christmas with them and that’s why I was leaving. They have always offered my parents to come over there, but my parents have done it once and we’re super uncomfortable.My parents are upset, since they offered not to come specifically so he could spend Christmas with his family. My husband thinks I’m wrong for being upset as we technically did spend Christmas Day with them. Considering that’s not when we celebrate, it’s not the same. We normally cook a nice meal and open presents after. They ate baked potatoes alone at my home.Edit: I’m new and it’s not letting me reply to posts. There was a typo and my parents aren’t baked potatoes.",

	"body" : "My boyfriend (27M) and I (27F) received a 2-player video game for Christmas that I’ve been saying that I’d like us to play together for a while now. I specifically asked for it as a gift from my Mother, and I chose this one because it’s a similar kind to one my boyfriend and I have enjoyed playing together in the past. It was a fun small gift, but one that meant a lot to me as a couple’s activity. I’ve been saying I wanted us to play this together for months, and we were both really pleased that we received it as a gift.We’ve been staying with his family since Christmas Eve, without our games console, so haven’t been able to play it yet. We’re going home for New Year’s, and my plan was that our NYE activity would be to play this game as we have no plans to go out, especially as we’ve had no quality time alone over the festive period.Tonight, he went to hang out with a friend who still lives in his hometown. I stayed in with his parents. When he got home, I asked if he had fun and what he got up to, and he told me that his friend had just got the game, so they played that.I’m really angry, and told him that he’s just robbed me of the joy of getting to play this together for the first time now that he’s played it with his friend. To me, it feels like he opened OUR present with his friend, and because he’s already played it, it’ll no longer be a special couple’s experience. It’s also not like this is the only thing he could have done with his friend, the friend has loads of games and would have understood if BF has said “actually, I want to save that to play with my GF because we received this for Christmas as a joint gift”. He thinks that because he’s only played the first few levels and it’s just a small game, I’m overreacting, even when I told him it’s much more than that to me - he spends a lot of time playing games with his friends which I’m glad that he enjoys, but it often gets in the way of us spending quality time together. This game that I wanted to play as a couple, when I don’t play many games, was my way of finding something for us to do together that we’d both enjoy. I feel like he totally didn’t consider me.So, AITA for telling me him shouldn’t have played this game without me?",

Few horrible incidents happened after and my fiancé could not take me being pushed over like that and proposed to move in before marriage. I agreed. After few months living together we got officially married. We wanted to make a wedding celebration and invite friends and family. I have been telling my dad that I want to invite my mom and X will not be invited. However, he tries multiple tactics to make me invite her including saying that he won’t come if I don’t invite her. On which I replied “ that’s your decision”. He even sent my aunt to urge me to invite X. Also told me he will show up with her, on which I told him she will be kicked out by security. All the family members know the story and on my side even though they cannot say it to my dad’s face. ( they feel like it’s not their place ) Am I the a-hole?",

She’s always treated me as her baby because I am her youngest child.  She cooked for me everyday and always bought me whatever I wanted.When I moved out, I gave her my new address so that if she ever felt lonely she could come visit me. Of course, she came by often. At least 3 times a week. I didn’t really mind it, she’s divorced and has no one with her. My sister (29F) is a doctor and basically lives at her hospital. My mom can’t ever really visit her so she comes to me. I’ve never had a problem until 8 months ago.About 9-10 months ago I got a boyfriend and he’s moved in with me. My mom hadn’t known about him, so as you can expect, she was very surprised when she came by to my house and saw him. She started asking him so many questions. Some of her questions were so personal, things she didn’t need to know.Of course, she started asking me why I needed a boyfriend when I had her. She told me that he was just playing with me. Which I know isn’t true. She was just really trying to get in my head. Why? I’m not sure. But anyways, she kept telling me this stuff for a while. Until one day, she came into my house while I was working and took most of my boyfriend’s money. Luckily, I have cameras so I caught her in the act and threatened her with the police.She stopped doing this until last month she came back in and took much more stuff. I again threatened her with police but she didn’t care. She said that she was just looking out for me. I told my boyfriend and he suggested to tell her that if she came back to my house then I would call the police and get a restraining order against her. I agreed and told her that. She was not happy at all to hear that. She then called me a bunch of things (like an egocentric bitch) and said that if I didn’t want her there then she was just gonna go over to my sisters’s house instead. I told her I didn’t really care. Then she started to break down and told me that I didn’t love her. I told her I did love her but what she was doing was wrong.She’s stopped talking to me so aita?",

I said okay, but the place I'm renting can only accommodate 9 people.Then she calls me again and said that we must invite my 12 year old cousin and her sister. I said again that the place can only accommodate 9 people and she said that she is fine sleeping on the floor. I said that is ridiculous, no one should sleep on the floor.After all this back and forth, I decided to cancel the Airbnb and book 3 rooms in a remote hotel.am I the asshole for changing the hotel reservation knowing that my aunt can't afford transportation for her and 2 girls to get there?Edit: I have been talking to my aunt for 6 days straight about this. Stating that the Airbnb can only accommodate 9 people. In the past I have stated the Airbnb rules to my family including the no pet policy and guess what, last time I went my cousin still brought her dog even though I said no and I was charged a penalty fee.I'm afraid that even though I have said no to my aunt, she might be bringing extra guests to the place. I am aware that this is a passive-aggressive move. She is still welcome and join us, but I doubt that she can afford 2-3 ferry tickets or try to pull this \"I'm bringing extra guests because it should be fine with the homeowner\" at a hotel. If she decides to come without the extra people I will reimburse her ticket cost after the fact.",

	"body" : "I'm engaged to a gal who purchased a home early in our relationship, prior to our engagement, for her and her 9 YO daughter. My kids and I would stay at the home with her typically one weekend per month when I was visiting my two kids who lived nearby. We always did projects around the house to help fix it up at my cost.We all live together now in an apartment in a different state that we both picked out together and moved into at the same time (she came from out of state; I was local). I covered 100% of expenses while she settled into a new job over 3 months.  This included rent, parking, storage, all utilities, rental insurance... literally all expenses for the home.Now that she's settled into her new job, I've asked her to pay her fair share of expenses. By fair, I suggested we total our combined incomes, determine the percentage we each contribute, then pay that percentage of the joint bills (e.g. my income makes up 59% of our joint income, so I'd pay 59% of the joint bills).  I thought this to be more fair than 50/50, even though she's using more of the home's value (her and her daughter vs just me).She asked if we would include her mortgage in the joint bills as we had loosely talked about before.  I told her I'd be open to it, but that she needed to be aware that co-mingling our funds to pay the mortgage would make her house a joint asset.  I also said that if I didn't have a stake in the property, I wasn't interested in paying any bills for it.She balked hard at this saying she'd have to cut back on paying down her prior debt so she could cover both the mortgage and her 41% of our bills. She also insinuated that I should pay even more than the 59% proposed.  I was surprised and a little appalled, particularly since she knows I'm carrying substantial debt as well.Am I the asshole?  Am I missing some perspective?Edit:  We did talk about her contributing to expenses when we moved in together and my potential financial contribution to the mortgage.  We did not discuss a specific percentage or dollar amount and she didn't realize that my paying would make the house \"community\" until I ensured she knew that first.  Yes, I agree, we should have been more explicit.  I shouldn't have assumed that a fair contribution wouldn't be an issue or that she would be OK with me having a stake in the property if I'm paying for it.",

This was completely unexpected but we’re both so happy and excited for this baby to arrive. So are our families.For some context, my parents divorced when I was around 2 years old and neither have remarried. My mom (50f) has been in many different relationships since the divorce where my dad (54m) hasn’t been in more than maybe 2 relationships. Growing up, I predominantly stayed with my dad and visited my mom almost every week. I love both of my parents and they both tried their best to make sure I was happy and well taken care of. My dad always had a steady job where my mom bounced between jobs. So my dad paid her child support and helped her out as much as possible so I didn’t go hungry or anything when I was with her.My mom and I always butted heads, especially once I got older. We have a pretty good relationship now even though we do argue occasionally. She has always resented my dad though. Growing up she would try and get me to dislike my dad by telling me stories and saying how horrible of a man he is. I think this is a main reason why we fought so much. She hated that I would want to be with my dad or go on vacation with him. While my dad would only speak highly of her and was a great buffer between us when we would fight.Now to the reason for the post. I found out I’m having a baby boy. When discussing names, my boyfriend suggested we name him the male equivalent of my name and have my dad’s name as his middle name. It didn’t flow right to me but switched around sounded perfect. We both fell in love with it immediately. So we decided to tell everyone the name after a few days. My dad was obviously shocked and beyond happy. My mom on the other hand said she would have preferred the middle name to be first. Understandable, but I thought that would be it.Last night I went to dinner with my mom. She said “I was very upset when I heard the name.” To which, again, I could understand. But then she said, “If you have another baby and it’s a girl, she better be named after me or I’m never speaking to you again.” I was completely taken aback and extremely upset. She then followed this up with, “I refuse to call my grandson my ex husbands name. So im going to call him Lex.” Which would be a nickname for his middle name. I didn’t know how to respond to her so I just stayed quiet until we left the restaurant.I’ve been thinking about this a lot since last night. I talked to my boyfriend about it and he said that she never should have said that to me and I did nothing wrong. But I can’t help but feel like I’m in the wrong for upsetting my mom so much. I really love the name and don’t want to change it though. I just don’t want my baby to grow up with his grandmother resenting him because he’s named after his grandfather.

My parents provide funds for me to attend university and for general expenses (eg. rent, food, etc) they explicitly stated their funds could not be used for partying/clubbing/etc. They do the same for my sister (F 22) as well. We both get the same amount per semester. We study in different towns but in the same country (too far away to live together). Our tuition and rent are about the same, although my rent is slightly higher but on the other hand, restaurants in her town are more expensive.I, however, developed multiple disabilities and chronic illnesses that even with insurance cost up to 700+ EUR a month. Over the last year, I've had to be in and out of the hospital for testing and treatment. I now have a diagnosis and a treatment plan but it's expensive. I don't party or even drink but, I burn through the funds considerably faster than my sister. My sister goes out clubbing all the time and even goes to concerts. She recently got a job to help fund this but previously used our parents' funds.As a foreigner in this country, it's incredibly hard for me to get a job due to my physical and psychological conditions. On top of this, there is a lot of anti-immigrant discrimination in the town I live in. I got accepted for 2 jobs before but both are not accessible to me (physically) anymore plus, to work I have to get my visa sponsored, and it's hard to find employers who will do that for me. I've done what I can think of to try and be strict with my money; buying only discounted food or the cheapest item, growing things myself if possible with my limited space, I haven't even gone to a restaurant since developing the condition nor have I gotten take out. I do lab studies at my university as a participant but they often pay only like 4-5 euros. I've sold clothing, food, etc. to try and get some income but it's incredibly hard. I had to make a GoFundMe to get a wheelchair as I couldn't afford it.Because of the difficulties in gaining finance and my medical condition causing a large variable expense every month, I am forced to stop treatment or ask for more funds.At the same time, my parents refuse to accept my new condition medically. I have given them any and every document they ask for and have tried countless times to explain it to them but they refuse to believe it. I don't blame them, it's a lot to process.

We ended up with 175 people on our guest list, and the capacity of the venue we chose is 150, but because we have a lot of out of state friends and family that we knew couldn’t make it, we were comfortable with this number. Our wedding is in March. I’m working on sending out invites right now, and only have 25 left to do.A few weeks ago, my fiancé’s mom informed us that she was going to add people to the guest list, including friends of hers and extended family that my fiance didn’t even recognize by name. I’m feeling quite frustrated because I asked her multiple times to add people and to make sure the numbers on the list were correct before we even booked the venue. I had ordered extra invitations to have just in case, but I had to order more stamps and seals for these extra invites. Our guest list went up to over 250. I am incredibly stressed about this, and I expressed this to my fiancé’s mom. She told me that she is stressed about it too, and that I need to take people off my list because I have more people invited than my fiance does.

Also, they have been on internships with prestigious companies and had a lot of fun w/ their coworkers during those times. In their most recent internship I went to visit them because I missed them & because they really wanted me to meet their coworkers. It was a lot of fun for me too. The actual situation at hand now is that their coworkers planned a small 5 day trip which spans over new years. My partner did not invite me. They deliberately told me I could not come. I did not ask to come, but this did hurt my feelings. When I asked why, they only said that they wanted to go alone and that they felt they couldn’t socialize as well when I was around… and that they did not want to be awkward for being the only person bringing their significant other.They did not give any indication of these feelings when I visited them during their actual internship, so I am especially confused why this is the case for a small trip that is less serious. The only reason I decided to be okay with the decision was because they insisted nobody else was bringing their significant other. They informed me that mostly guys are going on this trip, but that there will be a few women. Today I overheard on a phone call that one of their friends was expecting me and said it was unfortunate that I wouldn’t be going. Am I not respecting their independence? Am I the asshole for being upset and embarrassed by my partner’s decision? Any perspective would be helpful!Edit: I wanted to clarify that when I visited them during their internship I was the only significant other who visited, but nobody thought extra of it. Also, when I overheard on the phone call that at least one person was expecting me, it made me extra upset that the only reason I wasn’t there was b/c my partner said so.Edit 2: I have never posted here before and it has been brought to my attention that people apparently cannot respond.

	"body" : "To start off, I’m in my third trimester of pregnancy. My husband and I drove some 7-8 hours away to see his family for Christmas. Unfortunately, I had some of that magical pregnancy stomach upset the morning we left. Since pregnancy has you living on a knife’s edge between horrible constipation and a convincing dramatization of the Oregon Trail dysentery, I didn’t want to take Imodium and back myself up. I was doing pretty well until my baby decided to use my bladder as her yoga ball.No big deal. We had to get gas anyways, so we stopped at a big chain gas station on the East Coast. I hurried off to the bathroom while my husband took care of the dog and filling the car. There were 3 stalls, 2 regular and 1 accessible. One of the regular stalls was roped off and out of order. There was a very small line. I was behind another person and then this old lady walked in behind me. She asked if there was a line and I nodded. She was using a cane and was elderly but not extremely so.The regular stall opened up and the woman in front of me went in. Then the accessible stall (being the only one left) opened up and I went for it. The person who came out of that stall was not visibly disabled, they did not have mobility aids - I know invisible disabilities exist and am not trying to split hairs here but this is relevant to the story. I was in the stall for about 5 minutes, essentially applying a power sander in the form of cheap, single-ply TP to my poor, already sore backside.I exited and the old lady was still standing there tapping her cane in annoyance. She stared at me like I had just kicked her dog and yelled at me that, “Handicapped stalls are ONLY EVER for the handicapped!!!!!” She didn’t say anything to the person who had just exited the same stall before me.I am a pretty shy person and was fairly stunned. I looked down and muttered I was heavily pregnant. She yelled that being pregnant wasn’t an excuse, that she had been pregnant like most other women and was never in her life so rude as to steal resources from the disabled. At that point I had finished washing my hands and noped out of there.Now I’m worried I’m an ableist asshole. But, I’m genuinely confused. Was I supposed to let her cut me in line? If she had asked to go ahead because the accessible stall was the only one she could use, I probably would have let her go and waited. Likewise if she had a walker, wheelchair, or another cumbersome mobility aid that would definitely not have fit into a stall.What’s more is that the baby changing station was in the accessible stall, so it’s not like it was exclusively intended for those with disabilities. If I had an infant, would she have still expected me not to use that stall just because I’m not disabled?So, Reddit, what’s the etiquette on these sorts of things?",

I asked him what was wrong, and he sighed, stating “do you really have to go back to work?” I was confused, because we’d talked about this already, and I’d been reminding him my maternity leave was ending so this shouldn’t have been a shock. We’d also worked out us being the primary caretaker of our daughter every other day (when I’m teleworking I’ll watch her) and I thought this was fair. He then proceeded to go on and on about “what if I get fired” and “how will I have time to work” and empathized that I should just be a stay at home mom.This is where I start to get frustrated. I have been caring for my daughter 95% of the time since her birth. When she was a newborn my husband used to leave me by myself with her so that he could go off to DJ somewhere, or go over to his friends house to make music. I was the one waking all the time, every night, to care for her. I was the one that did all the regressions, growth spurts, and leaps. My husband, in my opinion, has had it easy with our daughter up until now because I’m not around to jump in when he decides things are getting too hard for him to deal with. It’s even in his job description that he’s allowed to do childcare while he’s working so that’s not even a good excuse.Now where I may be the AH is that ultimately, this isn’t our infant daughter’s fault. She can’t feed or put herself to sleep on her own and I’m worried she’s going to be all out of wack from him caring for her because he doesn’t always pay attention, he’s relied on me to watch her. Now I don’t know if I should just quit my job so I can watch her. I guess what I’m saying is I may be an AH because my daughter needs me, if that makes sense. AITA?",

I then explained after that IF they would have ASKED for a bottle i would have let them take one, and since they didn't ask and my mother just told him to take bottles i didn't let them.Keep in mind the only time i ever get any money is if i work during the summer break, during christmas, where i usually get maybe 1000 Sek, and on my birthday where i get about the same.I kindof feel like an asshole but since my mom didn't ask and just told to take one for both of them i got kindof upset because i ALWAYS have to ask if i want anything from the fridge, either my mums or my brothers stuff.I know 2/10 cans might not seem like much and that its completely stupid to not let them take any but they always told me to ASK before i take anything and i always do, so why they don't have to ask i dont understand.",

She had post-partum depression, along with a lot of other health issues which meant she 'missed' a lot of E's first few years. She was physically there and taking care of him, but she wasn't really able to play with him or interact with him and he did end up in front of a screen a lot just so she could cope. None of that is her fault. However, she's had her second child (M), and this time around things are so much better. She's happy, she's present, and she's doing all the things she feels like she 'missed' with E - baby photoshoots, cute keepsakes, playing, going to the park as often as possible, etc. Here's where my comment comes in - E has picked up on this, and he doesn't understand. He's overheard her say this is her chance to be a good mom, and he's also fully aware there are no special photos or keepsakes from when he was little while M has so many already and he's not even one yet. The other day E drew a picture and excitedly asked me \"Do you think it's good enough that mommy will love me as much as M? Do you think she'll take me to the park just me and her?!\" (for context - E is frequently left to 'spend time with daddy' while sister takes M to the park). My heart actually broke for him. I sat my sister down later and said it was great that she was having a good experience this time around with M but that E was clearly feeling neglected and she needed to be a good mom to both her kids. She got incredibly offended and told me to leave, and I've since had messages from our mom telling me I was completely unreasonable.

I’ve never had an issue in the past.This time, I receive a text from my step mom the evening before we leave after we’ve gone to bed. She details at least 10 other chores we must do before we go.

We are leaving at noon the next day to catch flights. Surprised, I didn’t respond right away. So she texted me also at 2am and at 8am with a photo of the cleaning supplies.

We work different jobs, but on Mondays we all get to work from home.This past Monday, I made the horrible discovery that I was out of groceries.  I tried to survive the day on two granola bars, but when 3:00pm hit I was absolutely starving.  I'm definitely not supposed to run personal errands during work hours, so perhaps I'm the asshole here by default.

	"body" : "I (26F) am a white American engaged to an Indian man (32M). I met my fiancé two years ago, and we started dating privately, as I wanted to protect him from my family. My dad (66M) is a sporty and loving guy whom I've always had a close relationship with. On the other hand, my mother (50F) and I have always had a turbulent relationship: I've always felt her pressure me to achieve academic success. I also related closely to the 'almond mom' stereotype – all my life she has insisted I try different diets, which pushed us apart. I moved out of the house at 19, and we got along a bit better for a while.However, when I was 21 years old, she started to nag about grandchildren. She has explicitly described her dream about my future family. Around that time I also realized how racist she is. Clearly her vision for her son-in-law is a blue-eyed Aryan or something like that. Only men with paper-like skin color seem to be good enough for continuing her bloodline! This is why I wanted to keep my fiancé a secret.Recently my mother started to send me lists of \"adorable\" baby names, reminding me of the fact that I'm not enough for her. Understandably, my fiancé wasn't pleased that I couldn't introduce him to my family, as he had done with his. I tried to explain that my mother wouldn't approve of him because of his skin color, but he insisted we'd go for at least a small visit. After weeks of fighting, I finally gave in and decided to go see my parents at a restaurant.We met them yesterday. As soon as my mother laid eyes on my fiancé, she visibly tensed up. She was not prepared to see a brown man, as I had only mentioned his American-sounding name earlier. During dinner, she was blabbering nonsense about stuff she doesn't normally talk about and looked uncomfortable. She ordered only an appetizer for herself, and just poked it while staring at her napkin. The irritation of all those years started to build up inside me, as I watched her efficiently ignore my fiancé and talk about the weather for the whole dinner. I thought to myself disdainfully, \"why isn't she asking about the grandchildren\"? So, in the heat of the moment, I burst out with \"We're pregnant\". She just sat in silence for a long time and looked at me. Finally, my dad stood up and basically dragged her out, saying they'd better get going. Upon leaving, he whispered \"congratulations\".After they left, my fiancé looked bewildered and asked what I was talking about. In actuality, I'm not pregnant and wasn't planning on getting in the near future. He was furious that I'd lied to him and my parents, although I tried to explain all the racism, microaggressions and other things from my childhood that made me blow up like that. He replied saying that he didn't notice any of that during the dinner and said that I can't define racism for him. To me, my mom's behaviour was clearly caused by my fiancé's looks, but he can't understand this. After that, we haven't talked.",

It can often be overwhelming but I know this is the way she shows love. I would consider myself more of a minimalist and try to just buy and keep what I need. My wife and my two younger siblings are similar, my mom knows this, and it is often something we all joke about and tease her about when a care package with half of Marshall’s arrives and we don’t know what to do with it all.Today a package arrived from her with about 20 different baby outfits in it. Some we loved, others we simply couldn’t imagine dressing our daughter in. I wanted to tease her a bit and give her some feedback on some of the outfits we liked and which ones we didn’t, while still being appreciative for the gift. I just know that this is the beginning of *many* more gifts to come throughout my daughter’s life and it just feels so wasteful to turn around and donate piles of unused stuff. I'm thinking ahead to birthdays and christmases and would really like to set some boundaries around gift giving with her. My thought was that if she could get a better sense of our taste / style, less would go to waste. The following texts were exchanged:Me: [Picture of one of the outfits we didn't love]Me: MomHer: You know those are adorable! *kissing emoji*Her: Did you not like the cute outfits?Me: Thank you for the clothes!!! Can we gently nudge you towards our style? lolMe: If you won't be offended I'll show you which ones we really like and which ones... not so much hahaHer: There's a place you need to visit on Reddit. It's called, am I the asshole? Go there and post what you said to your mom who picked out a variety of adorable clothes for the first grandchild in the family. Sent with zero strings attached, only with love and joy for her son and his beautiful wife. Include some photos. Let's see what others think, because in my humble opinion, your response is so unacceptable, I simply don't know what else to say.Me: Woah I'm sorry! We really are appreciative! Can we talk?Her: I've had people who said nothing at all, that were more appreciative. That's ok- I'll just put cash in a card for you.Me: Will you please answer the phoneHer: Honestly, no need to talk about this. I've learned my lesson. No harm no foul. I should have known better- It's on me.I tried calling her a few times to clear the air but she didn’t want to talk.I’m certainly willing to accept that I was the asshole here and after reflecting, I definitely could have led with showing more appreciation for the gifts and communicated more tactfully. I also could have just let it go, chalked it up to grandma being a grandma, said thank you and just donated the unwanted clothes.AITA?

We're both from the US, but we met abroad. Before I met him, I decided I wanted to return to school in the US. When we got serious, he asked me to stay, and I put my schooling on hold.We moved back to the US and live about a 6-hour drive from his family. My boyfriend always wanted to live in the area, so we agreed to try it out for a few years. We live close enough that his parents can visit frequently, and he can quickly fly back to see them when he wants. I am currently taking classes, and things are looking good.My bf's parents called a few days before Christmas and told him they wanted to visit for the holidays. He told them I was renting the extra room because his parents are conservative and they don't know about our relationship. The day after Christmas, his dad gets a call and has to return to work, but his mom decides to stay. She has cancer and wants to spend time with her eldest son. I thought things were fine until his dad called yesterday.My bf's dad told him his mom felt better here because the weather was nice, and she could relax. His dad pointed out that they wanted to visit more as a family (his brother, sister, and nieces) and that it would be crowded with me here. So his dad suggested that my bf get the extra room back and have me leave. His dad told him his mom had more energy here, and it was for her health.My bf told me what his dad wanted on our way to buy groceries and thought of some solutions. One is for me to move back to my parent's place ( my parents live on the opposite side of the country) and have a long-distance relationship while his parents visit. He tried to soften the blow by saying the flights are cheap if we plan ahead and that my classes are offered online.The other solution he thought of involves our friend. Our friend is having an interview in our area and plans to move into our building if he gets the position. My bf suggested that if our friend moved here, I could stay with him. Which is ridiculous, and I almost lost it.I didn't speak to him on our way back. When we got home, I went into the extra bedroom, and he hung out with his mom until she went to bed.I understand that his mom is sick, and I want to do what's right for her. However, a part of me thinks we wouldn't be in this mess if he told his parents about us. I also feel that it is unfair that I have to derail my life again. I pushed back going to school and stuck with the job I disliked because he asked me to stay. I feel like I am making more sacrifices and have been more accommodating about his needs and feelings.I'm unsure of what to do.AITA for wanting to tell my bf I don't want to leave and have him figure out his family?",

Nala is big dog, but she was so skiny that she weighted only 15kgs (where normally her sized dog should weight about 35kgs). I heard about her from my friends, who are owner’s neighbours, and went to ask them if they would give Nala for adoption. They agreed as “we do not need her here”.Fast forward to November - Nala is getting healthy, she is the sweetest dog, usually very calm but seems to be having separation issues - she starts howling at night if no one has been giving her at least some attention at daytime. Now my sister asked me if I could watch her kids (boy 5 and boy 3) for a few days while she went on an anniversary trip with her husband, and I agreed. Everything went well, Nala was at my parent’s, 4 days have passed and my sister returned. I went home to my parents and haven’t noticed Nala. Went to look if she was in the backyard, but she was not there.I waited until my parents got back from the store and asked them where the dog is. They said she was in a shelter in a different city. I asked them why, and their explanation was “She was bothering us with her howling”. I got really attached to Nala so I got extremely upset about it, and asked again and again crying why my parents would do this. They said that this dog was not theirs so it didn’t bother or hurt them, and they don’t see the issue here, because she was making them uncomfortable at their own place.

They could have called me and I would come by to check on her if she was misbehaving or anything, but every time I called they said that she’s great. We got into a fight and now everyone in my family are telling me that I’m the asshole for mistreating my parents and no one really wants to keep in touch with me.I have tried going to that shelter to take her back, as I am now renting my own place and landlord is kind enough to let me keep a pet, but as my mother turned Nala in under my name - shelter cannot let me adopt her…So please, help me understand, AITA?",

	"body" : "AITA for defending my wife and her female coworker from a drunk customer who was supposed to leave 30 minutes ago? They work at a bowling alley and had already asked him to leave a couple times since they were closed. I originally told him to calm down, since he was throwing F-bombs and shouting at them about being asked to leave. When he got hostile even more towards them I stepped in and told him if he doesn’t like it here he can bowl somewhere else. He complained that he’s been bowling here longer than I’ve been alive and I told him that doesn’t give him special privileges. My wife got upset and told me to stop arguing with the guy but when he starts calling me names and a “f- Face” and I say something back she gets upset at me. Now she doesn’t wanna talk to me cause I embarrassed her at work even though everyone said I was fine telling him off. AITA?Edit: So, this morning I was able to talk to my wife. As we talked about the situation she made it clear to me that she wasn’t upset about me stepping in, as she appreciated the fact I got his aggravation directed at me instead of her coworker and her. Since she felt he was getting hostile. But more at the fact that after she felt things had started to calm down me arguing with a guy who was yelling cusses and random cuss involved names at me I continued to argue back. She felt like I didn’t respect her asking me to stop arguing with the guy. Which I understand. We’ve since made things clear and are doing better. I’m also taking the day off work to go clear things up with the owners and bosses and possibly the guy if he’s there. We’ll see how things go.",

I switched into software this year and have little experience but am working really hard to keep up with others since they are all more experienced than me.I am home for the weekend. my uncle is over for dinner at our house. He's is asking me about my school. I tell him about how I switched into software and how I am currently looking for an internship this summer but it has been hard since I'm new to programming and don't have that much experience.He has the audacity to go on and say stuff like \"Why would you choose software engineering? most people in there have been coding since they were 10 and are way more experienced than you... there NO WAY you'll be successful even trying your best. I mean... only like 5% truly make it. Its basically impossible for you. Why didnt you choose something easier that you actually have a chance at succeeding in. I dont mean to discourage, Im just being realistic. You know me.. i dont like to sugarcoat and im telling you now you cant do it\" After have a brief conversation with him about this where he just goes ON and ON about how I cant do well. I get frustrated and without saying anything else i leave the room and go to my room upstairs.At this point I was FUMING, i could feel my blood boiling but they only thing I could really do was sit there and cry. So there I am in my room bawling my eyes out because I didnt know what else to do.Then, I heard the conversation he is having with my parents downstairs and he said verbatim \"shes an entitled whiny b*tch\" ... \"her brother is better than her\" ... \" she wont be successful like her brother\" ... etc etc. literally AWFUL things. Now, if you know anything about me, you know that my academics/career means EVERYTHING to me. Ive worked incredibly hard to get to where I am and have the grades that I do. Also, the topic of comparing success between my brother and I is a touchy subject for me.So at this point I was so angry in my room listening to him say this. Worst of all my parents were listening and didnt defend me at all. I got so angry listening to this, I opened my door and yelled \"STFU\", then my uncle comes upstairs and starts yelling at me saying \"you are entitled and spoiled and act like the world revolves around you. you will never amount to anything and i'm saying this because its what you need to hear\" me and him are in a screaming match for a bit. in front of his wife and kids I say \"GTFO, I dont wanna hear whatever it is you have to say.

	"title" : "AITA for warning my friend about her surprise party?",
	"body" : "I have 2 best friends, Maya and Jean. We’ve been friends since highschool, so we’ve known each other (and our families) for 15 years. We are kind of introverts, and we are happy doing low-key stuff for our birthdays. We let the birthday girl pick a place to have dinner at (usually at a fancier place than the ones we normally go to) and exchange gifts.For context, Maya lives with her mom. This means that when her siblings go visit their mom, this becomes Maya’s problem. She ends up helping with food for them, cleaning up, babysitting… just keeping busy when she’d rather be resting. Maya recently got into an argument with two of her siblings, since they owe her money. They came to an agreement that they’ll pay back, but considering her situation, this is really a dick move. She is working full time to support her mom and doing her masters degree, which is expensive, and knowing this, they’re still not paying her back soon. In Jean and I’s opinion, it’s not just money they’re taking from her, but the little downtime she has left during the weekends.Now, one of the siblings had a surprise party organized by his wife a few months ago, and yes, this was at Maya’s mom’s house. She had to help cook, ended up paying for some things, and had to help decorate. Even when some family stayed late to clean up, she and her mom still had to clean up some more the next day.Maya’s mom thought the surprise party was a great idea, and has texted Jean to let her know that the family is planning a party for Maya in two weeks. It will be at her house, of course, and it’s being organized by her siblings (that in my opinion should just pay her back instead). They’re asking Jean and I to take her out of the house on Sunday morning, so they can prepare, and then bring her back home for the surprise.To Jean and I this doesn’t work on so many levels. For starters, we had already made plans with her to go out on Saturday to a place she picked. It would be so unlike us to take her out for breakfast the next day, almost suspicious. Also, Maya’s sister (who had been estranged from her until recently) is contacting Maya’s friends from college to go to this surprise party, friends that she hasn’t seen in years. Jean and I are not sure she’d be happy to see them, since we haven’t heard these names in so long. In fact, the last time we did, she was telling us about how awkward their group chat was.I am sharing all this context because Jean and I think that this “surprise” could be more of a burden for our friend than a celebration. She has work and school the next day, she might end up indirectly paying for some of this stuff, and be forced to socialize on her birthday.We know Maya’s mom has the best intentions, and we don’t want to ruin all the planning the family is putting into this… but we don’t think our friend is a “surprise party” type of person.Would Jean and I be assholes if we warn Maya about the surprise party?",

My husband (42m) and I (37f) usually alternate each year between going to his parent's house and my parent's house for Christmas dinner, and Christmas Eve dinner we do at the other one's house. So this year we did Christmas Eve at my parent's house, and Christmas at his parent's house. Both families usually do a potluck style dinner.I'm lactose intolerant and have been for about 5-ish years. My family does a really good job of accommodating for this. So for all the potluck dishes, my family works really hard to make sure they don't put any butter in them, or milk, etc. They use plant-based butter that doesn't have lactose, soy milk, you get the idea. My sister is also gluten free, so we're used to making dishes in different ways. So, for Christmas Eve, I had a really great dinner with lots of food for everyone to take home leftovers.Christmas at my in-laws - they are really bad at remembering I'm lactose intolerant. They do know, but they have their traditional dishes that they make every year and they refuse to make them differently, which is fine! I don't want to make anyone not get what they're wanting just because I can't have it. But I've also gotten really tired of just eating a side green salad for Christmas or Christmas Eve whenever I go to their house. :( So this year, I brought over leftovers from Christmas Eve so I could eat something.My mother-in-law was REALLY offended. Even when I pointed out to her that there was nothing for me that I could eat (there wasn't even a salad this year because the one they made had dressing already on it that I couldn't have), she said that it was bad manners for me to bring my own leftovers, especially at a nice holiday meal.AITA? I recognize it probably wasn't polite to bring leftovers for a Christmas meal, but I never ask them to make anything specifically for me (not that they've offered) and I'm tired of going hungry.",

But her bf continued to yell at me, so I told him that he was insane if he thought I was to blame and hung up.This has since caused a rift in the family, with my cousin’s side saying that I’m in the wrong for almost making him relapse and for being rude on the phone (even though I never raised my voice) and with my parents and husband siding with me.

	"body" : "For context, I am the youngest of 3 brothers I am 26 and my brothers are 28 and 32. My parents got divorced when I was 18 months old, I initially lived with my mom for about 3 months before she couldn't afford to take care of me, so for most of my life my father and Grandmother raised me. (My father moved back in with his mother after the divorce to get some help raising my two brothers.)During the 3 months I was with my mom she requested that my father increase child support twice just to cover her never-ending spending habits.The main reason my parents got divorced is because my mom was a compulsive shopper and constantly wanted new clothes despite having a backlog of new clothes she hadn't worn yet.After the 3 months, I stayed at my mother's apartment, I was raised by my Dad and Gran for the rest of my life, the only contribution my mother gave in terms of monetary support was taking us boys on extravagant holidays with her new boyfriend, she never contributed any child support and now my father won't have a pension to rely on when he retires because he had to spend all his money to raise 3 boys.I only learned in my 20s the truth behind why my parents got divorced and how my mother paid no child support to my father, despite that being something they agreed to in their divorce.Now I hardly talk to my mom and am planning on blocking her on all socials. I haven't told my mother \"I love you\" in about 2 years because the truth is I don't love who she is, I love her for giving birth to me and that is it. I have learned my mother is actually a horrible person.TLDR versionMy parents got divorced and my father raised me with the help of my Grandmother, my actual mother never contributed in terms of child support to help my dad raise 3 boys.

	"body" : "Okay so many details here but I’ll keep it vague. Characters: me- 26 year old female. Chad- my fiance- 25 years old. Paul - Chads father- 55 years old.Paul texted Chad soon after we got engaged and told him that he would like a plus one to our wedding. Paul told Chad his plus one is 30 years old and that she really wants a signed baseball from Chad (Chad is a minor league pitcher lmao). Paul made Chad text this plus one to invite her based only on the above info “for brownie points” ? Lol. Chad and I were kinda side eyeing this bc why is a 30 year old fan girling over her “boyfriend’s” son and requesting a signed ball and a text from him ?Then I got on Facebook and looked up his plus one. Chad and I found out that Paul lied. the plus one is actually MARRIED and has 2 kids under the age of 4. She is ALSO 25 years old (3 months older than Chad and 1 year YOUNGER than me).We didn’t want to pry Paul for info or make him explain his relationship. So we told Paul that we didn’t appreciate being manipulated and that we were no longer comfortable with this plus one coming bc we don’t know her and our wedding wasn’t the place to bring her into our intimate moment. I.e. photos, front row in the ceremony etc etc.Paul has now drug this topic on for 6 months of our engagement- he is not respecting our boundaries. He informed us his plus one is happily married and that the three of them are in the relationship (?). He’s sold Chads things and forged Chad signature on an MLB check. And now Paul is not coming to our wedding bc his plus one isn’t invited. So my fiance will not have a father at his wedding. AITA? Or are we the assholes —?!Adding : Chad and I are very much on the same page here. Chad has done all of the communication with Paul. I have been super careful not to overstep Chad. I even told Chad - this situation is out of hand let’s just let him bring her and Chad said absolutely not. Chad is embarrassed by his dad’s actions. We are from the south, polygamy is not normal in the Bible Belt. Chad knows everyone will be weirded out if she comes. Again she’s 3 months older than Chad.",

So I didn't text and forgot to turn on sound before going to bed.This morning I woke up to 7 missed calls from my mom, several messages and calls on snapchat and some from my friends.I of course called my mom, thinking someone had died, and she was crying her eyes out asking where I was, having called my friends, if I was safe and that she'd been expecting the police to show up all night and didn't sleep a wink. She even cussed out my brother for thinking he knew where I was, didn't tell him either.I started crying too and have been feeling like shit the entire day, thinking that I should leave from my date early.Now I've lived alone for a few years and of course I don't tell my parents everything I do, I'm an adult I'm allowed to have a private life.

I called her before dinner today and she thought I was dead(thats why she was hysterical), I told her she shouldn't have cussed out my brother and that she doesn't need to know everything I do. You guys are right in that she doesn't need to know my location but I feel like it's a security blanket for me too, she asked if I was gonna remove her from my GPS list and I said no.

I took my licensing exam twice but failed and they cut me loose. Sucks, but I’m in a tough field and it’s not unheard of.  I’m moving back across the country now to figure out my career and what I want to do next as a license is not required for every job in my field.Every year since I was like 5yo my mom (63F) has written a holiday letter with a short paragraph on how everyone in the family is doing. Usually it’s fine but every year my sister and I have to edit what she says about us. My dad always heavily edits his too. Everyone always leaves out anything negative, it’s a holiday letter for crying out loud.This year in the days leading up to my huge move my mom sent me the letter to review. I told her I would look at it and get back to her. She said she kept my paragraph simple and brief.Well, before I got back to her, boom. She printed the letter as is and mailed it to nearly everyone we know. She wrote everything about me failing the exam and leaving the program.I was crushed, I sobbed. I feel beyond humiliated to have my personal information sent out like that. There were other wonderful aspects of my 2023 she completely left out. She briefly mentioned I’m getting married in 2024 at the end and that was it.WIBTA if I explained to her how awful what she did was? It will hurt her but I feel she needs to understand. I’m extremely hurt right now and want her to know. But maybe I can’t see it clearly.Edit to add: thanks for the dozens of kind replies guys. You all perfectly put into words how I was feeling. I talked to my mom, even using a lot of the comments to help guide how I talked about it. It didn’t go great, but I feel a lot better after having just told her. She said she just doesn’t see how it was hurtful at all. Refused to acknowledge what she did was wrong or could’ve been upsetting. She insisted that I shouldn’t be ashamed of the truth. That all she was doing was telling the truth and what’s the point of a holiday letter if it’s all fake. I rebutted that just including positive things in a holiday letter is not lying. Basically… I could just scream. I’m so disappointed. Oh well. That’s family. She probably won’t be making a speech at my wedding now since I cant trust her to understand basic concepts.

So, for Christmas we promised we would cut back on gifts for each other, setting a $50 limit and saying we would not do stockings for each other. This was hard for me, as Christmas is a big thing for me and gift giving is something I love to use to show love. Still, I stayed close to the budget.About a week before Christmas, my husband came home with a bag from Target and said not to look because my stocking stuffers were inside. I panicked and said “I thought we weren’t doing stockings”. He had forgotten about that part of the conversation, and said he just bought a few things. So, I went out and got stuff for his stocking. The thing is, I love buying stuff for stockings, it’s my favorite part of Christmas, so I went a little bit overboard and ended up spending about $200 on his stocking.On Christmas morning, when we emptied our stockings, he had gotten me just a few things like he said, and felt guilty when I opened mine. I assured him it wasn’t a big deal, as I truly was happy with what he gave me and was happy he was able to save money since I clearly could not. We had a happy Christmas and didn’t have any more issues.…until we saw my family. I had gotten myself a Groupon for some CrossFit classes and my family asked how I could afford to do CrossFit right now while we are so broke. I told them about the Groupon and they were still confused since we should be saving money. So I lied and told them it was a stocking stuffer from my husband. They took that a lot better.However, when my father mentioned to my husband that he got me a really good gift with the CrossFit classes, my husband now feels like I lied because I didn’t want to be embarrassed by his lack of gifts. I assured him that was not the case but he is not convinced and is embarrassed that I “had to lie” about my presents to my family.So, am I the asshole?",

My father had him when I was in my 20s, so I always spoiled my little brother whenever I visited my pop's house because after he was born, my father couldn't work anymore due to illness and wasn't bringing in much money anymore. So I took it upon myself to bring my brother toys, clothes, electronics on his birthday or Christmas, or money every time I visited.My stepmother has a brother who now makes 3 times what I do. This dude, from the moment his son was born left him in my stepmother's care because he was going through a financial rough patch at that time and his own mother was an addict, so she was useless. My stepmother took a liking to the baby and my father reluctantly agreed to take him in like he was the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.At first, whenever I visited, I'd keep him in mind whenever I thought of bringing pizza or some other food over. I never got him anything for his birthday, but I'd get him something small on Christmas so he doesn't feel left out when I'd bring my brother something and I'd give him a little bit of money, though not as much as my brother, whenever I visited. When I took out my brother, I'd include him as well, so he doesn't feel left out.But in the last few years, his own father has started a small one-man business and he's now making like 3-4 times more what I'm making. At the same time my father's health declined and money was getting tight around the house. But this guy wouldn't take back his own kid. So my father and stepmother were footing the bill for this kid, even while his father was perfectly capable. I understand that maybe they didn't want to move the boy somewhere else and completely change schools, lose his friends or whatever, but he's still a little a kid, so he'll get over it.My father died in 2018 before the pandemic started and the economy started tanking due to it. Money was already tight because he wasn't working and my stepmother had to get a job and basically be his nurse until his death. But after my father's death, I found out about her brother's business and how well off he was. The mother is still an addict and/or dead somewhere in the streets which means she's still out of the picture. Though I will admit that he started giving my stepmother some kind of child support for his kid after my father died and is helping out with groceries for the whole house each month.This year, money was tight for me, so I only got Christmas gifts for my brother and didn't even give anything to my stepmother. Keep in mind, this woman has never given ME anything for Christmas.When I bring my brother his gifts, I'm in the living room watching Christmas movies with him and I overhear my stepmother's mom in another room, who was also visiting that year for Christmas, saying that I was wrong for not including her nephew.

When she gets a new BF, she becomes unrecognizable. It has happened time and time again since my parents divorced when I was 8. She’s dated guys who despise kids or dislike me or my sister specifically. A past BF called my sister a bitch to her face when she was just 13, and my mom blamed her. These men become her everything. Both my sister and I still struggle with trauma stemming from her behavior when she is in a relationship. It’s like whiplash.Fast forward to now. About a month ago, she started talking to a man online who lives across the country. They would talk on the phone for hours every day, she was even pulling all nighters before work. She would rave about how he was the best guy despite some of his past being incredibly concerning (she believes he’s changed). She thinks she knows him very well… and she doesn’t.Coincidentally, he had just accepted a job in our area when they started talking. I said to her, woman to woman, please do not let him move in (she has moved guys in after just months before). She said of course not and that they were taking things slow.We fought about it for the last time 3 days ago, she was raving about him again and I replied that maybe she should be a little more skeptical. I said I didn’t have a good feeling about it, she didn’t take it well. I decided after that she’s an adult and I just need to stay out of her business. The next morning, she texts me that he is flying in last minute and staying at the house for a few days.I woke up at a friends house to the text. I replied that I was not comfortable with that and she knows this, but that I would come get my stuff for school and work and stay somewhere else. She said “ok”.I spent that entire day crying because my mom is usually my best friend, and now I feel less important than a man she’s known for a month. I called her selfish for this, and now our family members are split. Half say that she’s an adult, it’s her house, and I can get over it. The other half say that at the very least, she should’ve considered how I’d feel since that is currently my home. My sister is on my side which means the most to me since she understands. I’m staying with her for now.Do I think this was incredibly stupid and unsafe? Yes, but that’s not my business. What hurts me is that she gave me hours notice that some random man would be staying in our home, and that she would rather her daughter pack up and leave than tell this guy to get a hotel. But I’m 22, not 15, and it’s her house. So am I out of line? AITA for calling her selfish?Tl;Dr— my mom had her long distance online BF of a month fly in and stay at our house after I made it clear I wasn’t comfortable with him. I packed up and left and then called her selfish.",

	"body" : "I(13f) recently told my teacher that I think the rules at my new middle school are crazy . This was mostly because there are multiple rules that are frankly just weird, such as all the girls have to have the \"school girl haircut\" aka a short hairstyle that doesn't touch the collar of the uniform and cant have layers. I think that this rule is really silly and stupid to put it in gentle terms because when i joined the school i had to cut my long hair that reached my thighs. After that I went on this long rant to my teacher about this, later she simply told me that i was being \"too attached\" to my hair and that the school board knows what's best for me and that I should have put my opinions in more gentle terms . i just stared at her blankly then left the classroom a few minutes later. Later that day she confronted me and told me i \"shouldn't be so sensitive\" and that (i should respect my elders and that I had to stop being an asshole about it ) basically, she then told me I had to complete an essay about respect and hand it in to her tomorrow.

She’s fine for now and does not appear to be in any pain, but the vet says she will get worse.The surgery itself will cost $3,500. Follow-up chemo will be about $4k, maybe more. Altogether, the price tag for treatment will top $10k. I can afford it, but it will wipe out my savings and require me to take on a lot of debt to boot.I love this dog. I love her very, very much, but she is sixteen friggen years old. She’s well past the life expectancy of most dogs, deaf, and nearly blind. Honestly, she’s a bit like a Roomba. She spends most of her time licking the rug and getting stuck in corners.And I can’t justify wiping out all my savings, or taking out a high-interest loan, to extend her life a year or two.But my mom is very, very attached my dog too. She thinks no amount is too much to get more time and that the 60% chance that she’ll even live in the first place is good enough reason to try. That’s all well and good, but it’s not her financial security.I’ve decided that we’re not going to do the treatment.  Maybe the mass won’t grow but if it does, I’ll make sure she’s as comfortable as possible when it's time to go.No one is blowing up my phone or anything. My mom is just being really passive-aggressive. Right now, she's petting my dog and saying \"if she really loved you, she'd save you.\"I hate myself right now.

	"title" : "AITA suing my ex for not paying rent",
	"body" : "So a couple of month ago my girlfriend of 4 1/2 years broke up with me. She gave reasons, mainly that she didn’t have the energy to be in a relationship with me anymore. I did not want to break up and am pretty shook about the whole thing as this is my first real love, long-term relationship, and breakup. It was the 2 of us and my best friend all sharing a house. When she broke up with me she made it clear she wanted to exit the lease and was going to stay with her mom who lives about an hour away. She gave me these options:The first and best option was to sublet the lease and have someone sign in her place. We actually did have someone who wanted to do that which would’ve worked out perfectly for everyone. However the landlord made it clear that was impossible without signing a new lease entirely and we don’t consider that an option.The second option is for me and my friend to sign her out of the lease. She would pay a $500 fee and then we would be stuck paying her rent for the duration of the lease (5 month)  Me and my friend said this isn’t a good option for us since we can’t afford to pay all of that plus utilities.The third option is that a $5000 termination fee is paid and the lease is ended early. This would leave all of us living with our parents again for a couple months. Me and my roommate didn’t want to do this. We told her she would have to pay the entire $5000 and we wouldn’t split it 3 ways. She says she cannot afford that and we are obligated to split it since we are all on the lease.After talking to my friends dad who is an attorney he made it clear those were not our only options. He said unless she pays the entire termination fee, we could just do nothing and keep the lease going. This was a good option for me and my friend, but bad for my Ex. She would have to drive an hour to work and back and pay rent for a place she wasn’t staying. This would also prevent her from getting her own place until the lease was over. When we told her this was the option we are choosing she quickly took all her things out of the house and completely ghosted both me and my roommate.So pretty much a month goes by and she doesn’t pay her portion of the rent. We spoke to the landlord who said she was not answering any attempts at contact. I even texted her daaaaad. My friends dad says we are able to sue her for her portion of rent. So we did and are currently waiting to have the papers processed and served. It won’t cost us any money in the long term since my roommates dad will represent us for free. However this seems to be completely screwing her over and it feels petty taking legal action against my ex-girlfriend of almost 5 years. This would also potentially mess up her renters history. Is it too far suing her or is this a reasonable response?",

	"title" : "AITA for asking my roommate to have her mom over less often?",
	"body" : "I (21 F) have recently started renting a house with my friend (22 F). This is my third year renting, and her first time leaving home, where she lived in a small apartment with her mom, where she didn’t have wifi or modern tv or most modern technology.We have been living in the house for a month, and my roommate’s mom has been coming over almost every night. Sometimes she will stay for an hour; sometimes six. She helps herself to using all of our things such as our Wifi, our smart tv, our air fryer, all our dishes and leaving them in a mess for us to clean, etc. She has also been frequently bringing her boyfriend, and sometimes even his friends. My roommate never tells me if they are coming over and I often come home from work to find them in my living room. What’s even more frustrating for me is I’d say about eighty percent of the things we have are actually mine too; things I gathered over the first two years I was renting, but I barely find time to use them as her mom and her boyfriend are using them at times when I would want to myself.I get trapped in conversation with her mom when I don’t feel like talking to anyone and just want to chill every night I come home and they’re there. I work long shifts, 10-12 hour days, and it is very frustrating when I have been looking forward to chilling and watching tv but my roommate’s mom and her boyfriend have their feet up on the coffee table watching tv with a plate full of food they cooked in the air fryer. Sometimes my roommate isn’t even with them and is just in her room.AITA if I ask my roommate if she came over less? I’m not sure how to ask her without seeming insensitive; her and her mom are very close as it has just been them most of their lives. I have been thinking about asking her if they could just come over once or twice a week and spend the other nights at their place. Is that reasonable?UPDATE: I tried to talk to her. “I very nicely tried to begin a discussion by saying “hey, your mom is here quite frequently, I was wondering if you could have her over a little less often” to which she responded “OMG it’s literally my mom, you can’t control how frequently I have visitors” and went to her room and slammed the door and refused to talk about it.

When I fell pregnant, we moved into my husbands place. I'm very family orientated, with 3 younger sisters who I adore and are my best friends. Last year, when I had our baby, my husband and I moved elsewhere (2 hours from his upbringing/family, 4 hours from mine).I went back to work when my daughter was 5 months. My MIL travels two hours each week to and from us, to look after my daughter for 2 days a week. My husband minds our daughter the other 3 days.My mum has 3 kids under 15, with the youngest 2 being 8 and 11 - so she's unable to drive 4 hours to babysit obviously. However, without asking, she's happily offered to babysit at her place and come and stay with us during school holidays (12 weeks each year) to mind our daughter. Coming up to the holidays, it was agreed my family would spend Christmas and new years with us - and leave on 3rd Jan. on the 4th jan, I took my daughter to see my MIL, as I understood she would've missed her.Current issue: for two weeks (8th-19th jan) work is extremely busy and I need either my mum or MIL here helping me with meals & looking after my baby. Obviously I would prefer it to be my mother as I don't spend time with her during the year - BUT I asked my MIL first if she wanted to come and babysit during those two weeks. She said no, so I asked my mum to (who said yes).It's the start of the second week and this morning my husband asked me if he could go take our daughter to see his mum. I was shocked and so hurt. (My mum barely gets to spend time with her and you want to take her away from me and my mum??)My husband doesn't like me spending more than 2 nights away from him, and as mentioned above, with the four hours distance and my mum having younger kids with school/sporting commitments my mum only sees our daughter during school breaks, compared to my MIL who sees her weekly in the school term. Because of this, my husband believes my MIL needs to see her more because she misses her and is more of a grandmother to our daughter.My husband thinks I'm trying to hurt my MIL or play games with his mum/my MIL. I've told him that she can come stay with us next week, after my family leave.He thinks that his mum/my MIL deserves to see our daughter because she looks after her 2 days a week.AITA for thinking my MIL can wait until next week to see our daughter?",

I was able to go to school with the help of loans and I worked very hard at this school, even graduating a semester earlier than expected. Currently, all of my own money is going to graduate applications. My mom (49f) has been very generous in helping me out with school by letting me take out parent plus loans for the entirety of undergrad. Last semester, I must have made a mistake and requested the entire year’s loan for the fall when I should have split it between spring and fall. I remember telling her to watch out for a sudden large deposit into her bank account (the refunds go to the borrower) and that the money should be saved for the spring. She said she had forgot and that she was in a “very low mental place” and that she spent the money on bills and other life necessities. She promised me she’d make the money back and pay it by the time I graduated.Last night I called my grandmother and told her the situation. I was scared of being unenrolled from classes and barred from graduating. I told her this and said I wasn’t asking for money but I was scared and angry and didn’t know what to do. She said (without me asking) that she would pay and to not let this “become a fight with my mother and potentially face estrangement”. I thanked her and calmed down a little bit until this morning.Here’s where I may be the ah. After running an errand I came home and my mom told me to take a seat in the living room. She basically told me about how hard she works to make a life for me and that sometimes she thinks of abandoning my brother and I. We’ve always had these sorts of fight where she threatens to leave and though I bit my tongue before saying what I wanted to, I told her to stop worrying about tuition because “I figured it out and called grandma to help me”. She was pissed because I went behind her back in a immediate family issue and fixing the problem would have made her feel better about the situation (even though I NEVER got an apology). She told me not everything was about me and that I was selfish before storming upstairs and slamming the door. I know she’s supported me for the last several years and maybe I should have let her handle it, but her making several thousand dollars on top of life costs is not feasible and I am not risking my degree for that.So AITA for going behind my mom’s back when she said she’d pay my college tuition?",

	"title" : "AITA for comparing my intern to a child?",
	"body" : "Last summer, I (M43) decided to hire Linda (F25) as the new intern working directly under me at the company I work for. Linda is a long-term friend of my niece Jess (F24), and Jess essentially begged me to hire her as Linda was struggling to find work in her field of study and wanted to live in the city I work in. I’ve taken on a sort of mentorship role for Linda, teaching her the ins and outs of our field. Linda is a quick learner and has been able to largely succeed in her role.Given how closely we work, we’ve gotten to know each other quite well, and as such, Linda does regularly open up to me about her own personal life. That being said, for the past month or so, I’ve been getting the feeling that Linda seems to want something more than employment. It was subtle at first, but I’ve noticed she has started acting more informally around me. It started with many compliments and bizarre questions; then, her mannerisms started to change. She has also begun texting me outside of work hours (which is pretty normal) but about things that are more casual and non-work related. At our relatively recent holiday gathering for work, she kept coming into my personal space, and her behaviour and comments were a little suggestive, to say the least.This past Friday evening, I and a few of the younger workers (including Linda) needed to work late to finish off a project. When it got late, I decided to order us some pizza. I said something along the lines of “What do you kids want on your pizzas?” Linda seemed taken aback by this comment and asked me if I thought she was immature or something. This caught me by surprise, so I told her that while I didn’t think she or the other interns were immature, I mentioned how since they were all young and new in the field, they lacked experience and were therefore like kids from my perspective.She seemed very disappointed by this and didn’t speak with me unless work-related for the rest of the evening. She was also absent yesterday from work \"due to illness.\" I told one of my non-work friends about this last night, and he suspects it's probably because of what I said.AITA?",

	"body" : "Me(18F) & my older brother(26M) argue constantly over small disagreements, it usually stems from him trying to “parent me” in some sense. We both live under my fathers roof & it was agreed that once we finish school we pay rent or move out. I haven’t finished school yet & I'm planning to go to college as well. My brother has been finished school for a while now &  he is jobless at the moment. He has his own family & my father told him and his gf(24) that he could live with us until he got his feet planted on the ground which is pretty understandable cuz he became a father at 21. The issue is that he has had his feet on the ground for a very long time & he had a position that payed very well & he made it clear to me the other day that he “has enough money to start a business” so it made question why he has the money for that but not the money to afford a mortgage. It’s no shocker he has money saved up because he doesn’t pay my father rent & neither does his gf. They live in the basement, 1 of the bedrooms was turned into a gaming room, my brother's bedroom was turned into their kids room & the guest bedroom is being used by my brother's girlfriend's sister(who also doesn’t pay rent) & then they turned the living room into their bedroom. So there’s not even enough rooms for all of them living down there. They leave messes in the kitchen & expect me to clean up after it. If I leave a plate or 2 in the sink he yells at me to clean it up but that means I have to clean their dishes so I've refused to clean them up a couple times. My father works week on week off & the house usually gets a big clean up before he’s home but they expect me to clean up all of upstairs even though i’m pretty much confined to my room everyday, i eat my meals in my room, i clean my messes up in the kitchen & so on. You might as well call me Cinderella at this point because all I do is clean up after everybody else. I love my brother & his family don’t get me wrong but it's unfair on me, i can’t have the kitchen between 5-7pm every night, if i want to clean my dishes i have to put all of theirs away so there’s room for mine, i have to be quiet in the evenings because their room has no walls and they can hear me. Me & my father had conversations about him moving out & my brother overheard me & my dad’s conversation, he later told me I was “stabbing him in the back” because I agreed with my dad kicking them out. I feel like an asshole agreeing with my dad but at the same time i think he’s old enough to move out & considering he said he has enough money to start a business i’m sure he won’t be homeless, there’s also 3 adults so i’m sure they could put their money together & buy a place. I honestly really wouldn’t have a problem with them if my brother didn’t try to parent me and speak to me like i’m less than him but it’s beginning to get to me, and even in situations where he’s wrong he and his gf will “gang up” on me.",

Jack and I moved in three years ago almost and Dave moved in two years ago under the condition that he has a job pays his rent and take the trash out. Dave has a girlfriend Miley (18f). Miley is extremely different than me and that’s okay. Jack and I are introverts who like quiet and to be weird in the peace and quiet of our own home. Dave is a sometimes introvert sometimes extrovert and it worked well with us till his girlfriend started coming around. Miley is a princess. She has to have her way or it’s a scream crying temper tantrum. We don’t like to stick our nose in their relationship because it’s their relationship we don’t know the intimate details of it and we don’t need to. I grew up in an extremely dysfunctional family so I like to have my peace and quiet it’s helped me fix myself a lot. But with Miley coming around I’m picking up my old bad habits. I also lost my only grandma and my dad in the space of three months in the end of the last year so things have been stressful to say the least. Miley has been at the house for the last three weeks non stop. When I lost my grandma I asked Dave if Miley could maybe not come over for the night because I was grieving and extremely upset. That ended with Dave “putting his foot down” and Miley was still there and had a scream tantrum over him not making her ramen right. When my dad passed I wasn’t as upset he was a horrible person but he was still my dad and Miley was to busy to be there so I got the quiet I needed. Dave doesn’t have a job right now and it’s not his fault but Jack and I are paying for everything. The grocery bill has gone up because Miley is an extremely picky eater and I refuse to let people go hungry in my home but that means we basically have 30$ for two weeks to make it to and from work. Jack and I are extremely stressed right now and the scream tantrums are not helping. This morning I put my car in a ditch to prevent an accident Jack and I are fine and so is the car but we had to pay 150 to get us pulled out so we really have nothing except things Miley won’t eat and I can’t stand another scream tantrum so I asked Dave if Miley could go home and sent him pictures of the car in a ditch saying we’re extremely stressed and if Miley could go home for the night just tonight. We haven’t received an anwser but god I don’t want to go home if she’s there I can’t stand another scream tantrum or to hear her whiny voice as she cusses him out for something she herself can do on her own. Am I the asshole for asking her to just go home for one single night. I feel like I’m the asshole because he does have a say on who’s in the house seeing as he does live there but two of the three are saying go home and one is being stubborn and ignoring the house vote.Edit: we did give Dave a warning that if he did not have a job by February first he has to leave. We did that over a month ago so he will be gone soon. Dave lost his job due to a Karen loosing their mind over gas not pumping fast enough. Jack and Dave are subtenants as well.",

My husband said to stop worrying about it (again) but SIL involved my MIL and MIL’s sister and they agree that a parent making their kids dress up all matchy is at worst selfish and at the very least: obnoxious.

I’m lucky enough to have started an Etsy business when I was 15 so I have some disposable income. Which means my sister keeps borrowing cash from me. A 20 here, a 50 there.Sometimes I let her keep the cash, sometimes I ask her for it. Sometimes she pays, sometimes she doesn’t.But towards the end of October last year (2023), she called and asked for a pretty big loan. 1500$ and promised to pay it all back. For a 19 year old making her own money, 1500$ is a LOT of cash. She said she’ll pay me with her next paycheck and just needed it to “get by” so I agreed.Well, getting by apparently means buying an iPhone 15 Pro with a loan she got from me. A loan that she kept refusing to pay back, despite her getting paid biweekly and knowing she can pay me back with just one paycheck.I think what irritated me the most was that she used money I removed from my savings to buy a phone. I didn’t want to bring this up during Christmas so I waited until afterwards and asked her about my money. She was loud and combative and the conversation didn’t go anywhere.Now usually, my grandma gifts us cash for Christmas. It really depends on the interest she’s gotten out of her investments. Guess how much each grandkid got? Exactly 1500$. And guess how much my sister got? Exactly 0.This was bc granny hands out the cash in envelopes and usually gives an envelope to a present sibling to pass on (we’re 7 grandkids).I didn’t pass on my sister’s envelope.Well, my sister found out. She called me and screamed at me for “stealing” her money and said I should pay it back immediately or else she’d sue me. I reminded her that she owes me much more than 1500$ (honestly, maybe even up to 5k cause 20’s over the course of 3 years realllyyyyy adds up) and I just took back what she owed me.My family is pretty much evenly split. My older brother and younger brother all agree with what I did as she borrows them money and doesn’t pay back but my parents and my oldest sister say it’s not the right way to go about “conflict resolution”.So Reddit, am I the AITA here?",

We have always been very close, as I spend a lot of time babysitting him while his parents work.He turned 7 on Saturday and the whole family got together for dinner, and slowly filtered out towards the end of the night. By the end I was the last one left and we did some drawing together, and the last interaction we had was \"love you lots, bye\" and a big hug, like usual. Before that we agreed I would pick him up from school to go out today for a birthday dinner and some cake, just me and him.Since then something has changed. I have seen him 3 times and he has completely blanked me. Not everyone, just me. He makes a point to talk to other people in front of me and doesn't even look at me when I'm talking to him. Even to the point of he was asking for medicine for his cough but didn't even acknowledge me trying to give him any. I've tried explaining this is hurtful, asking why, and I'm getting nothing in response. He is his usual self with everyone else.I now won't see him until later today and honestly, part of me is hurt and doesn't want to spend the quality time together and just take him home to the family, but mainly I'm concerned about taking him out and being completely ignored out in public which to me seems like it could become a safety concern. I also don't want to reward bad behaviour.I'm worried I might just be justifying punishing him for having my feelings hurt and also not being understanding of his age, and I don't have my own children or experience with 7 year olds as he is my only nephew. I also don't want to make things worse by not taking him and having him resent me for it.Thanks.EDIT: My current plan is as follows:I will be picking him up from school and, instead of going straight out which was the plan, taking him home first and try to talk to him again, where i will explain that he is being hurtful and that he doesnt have to tell me why but if he wants to he can, but if he wants to just move on he can change out of his school clothes and we can go out and have a good time, but if he wants to proceed ignoring me we will leave it until another date.I have also made my MAIN concerns about safety bold as nobody seems to have addressed that, with some people straight up saying i am too worried about my feelings being hurt, when my point was specifically that i want to clear up that that is not why, in my mind i was thinking this, but wanted to be clear i wasn't just excusing myself.",

For context her gym is a 7 minute drive plus we have two cars so I didn't want to drive her because not only does it inconvenience us, but it lines up for our dinner time. Due to our schedules our lunch is at 5:00 so the two days she goes to the gym, we have to take her to tge gym, go back, make lunch in a hurry, feed my kid then hurry back up to pick her up or else she'll be mad.I arrive from work at 4:30, I'm human and I just want to rest a little because I have to cook but immediately forced to drive her to a very close location it gets to me.

My mom wanted to pitch in to buy a house. I first declined, then she insisted and told me I wasn’t leaving her house if I did that. So we looked for a small house. I found one and I had saved enough money to buy it. My mom insisted on me using the money that was in an account that was opened at my birth. It had my birthday money and my inheritence from my dad. It was in her name but she made me believe that I was entitled to that money so I agreed. Using that money I only needed a small loan that I could easily pay off in 10 years. So I bought it and my name is the only one on the deed.She has a spare key and uses it whenever she wants. I come home from work and see the dishes have been done and the bed has been made. I called her to tell her that she shouldn’t do that. I told her I didn’t feel comfortable with it. She ignored it and kept going when I was at work. One day she threw away stuff I still needed. I called her saying she should not touch my stuff and should respect my boundaries. She got upset and told me I was being ungrateful.No she is mad at me because I didn’t message the family a happy new year. I told her I did message some family. She then called another one and shoved the phone in my face so I could talk to them. I panicked, pushed the phone away and told her to leave my house. I then cried for some time. I called her to ask if she got home safely. She yelled that I have disgraced her and called me ungrateful. I told her she didn’t respect my boundaries and I didn’t want to get yelled at in my own house. I apologised for kicking her out and told her I wanted an apology for her overstepping. She laughed and told me that I was a horrible daughter. So AITA?",

Henry loves living the good life (staying at the Hilton when on trips, spending $200 on a fancy Japanese dinner, etc.) and if someone suggests going somewhere to eat that's below his standards, he throws a hissy fit.I proposed a group trip to Europe. Henry was a yes, a few were no's but the main core were on the fence. I see the main core more than Henry and I asked what's their biggest worry for going on the trip. They all said that they do not want to travel with Henry because he will double the cost of the trip.Henry hates being excluded and if we sneak away he'll know and make things worse. We know he has a LDR BF in the US (we live in Canada) and Henry goes to see him on 4th of July, American Thanksgiving, etc. So we know when Henry is going to be gone and the idea was to tell Henry and plan the trip the Tuesday before he heads to see his BF. We think this is a good way to tell Henry and avoid him coming.I told another of my friend groups this plan (they don't know this friend group) and they said it was kind of a dick move to deliberately exclude Henry. But if Henry comes, the trip is cancelled so I insisted that this was the lesser of two evils.TL;DR- We want to take a group trip to Europe which will be pricey. We have a friend that only likes upper class things and will throw a tantrum when things don't go his way. We plan on taking the trip a couple of days before he goes to see his LDR BF so he can't come.AITA?E: since I cannot respond to comments-We have had face to face talks with Henry in the past and he’s been retaliatory. He’s typically a calm guy but very weak to criticism. Henry is a spiteful guy at times. Apparently he’s still mad at one of the core guys over something that happened 6-7 years ago and is not a factor in his life.This is a one time thing so far. No subsequent trips planned so this should be a one off situation.We could set a plan but Henry will force his agenda. Henry will agree and then try to take control.We have addressed Henry’s spending. He failed to pay his cards on time twice and a couple of guys had to bail him out. That didn’t convince him to change.We don’t bend to Henry’s demands despite the hissy fits. He just has a sour look on his face and often says “isn’t this better than what you guys pick?” when he gets his way.Some backstory about Henry. The group was formed out of individual friendships and became one by association and the core have become tight-knit with a couple on the periphery. Henry was a core of the group but then he became this pissy person I described, we talked to him and he fought back so we started to phase him out, multiple people have called him out because he changed and then he met his BF and reverted back to OG Henry.E2It may sound like we give Henry control but we don’t. We just let him sit there and pout and not let him ruin our day. Multiple people have talked to him (from both his friend groups) the first time and he got better. Then he reverted back to OG Henry.Maybe it’s time for another discussion but the fact that one group already cut him loose didn’t open his eyes is probably a sign that what we say won’t have any clout and his BF and BF friends enabling him takes priority.",

He said he didn’t like that because it was showing my ego. From his perspective, we were both comfortable and warm in bed and I could’ve gotten up to get it myself. Why should he get up and do it when I’m perfectly capable of it? He also said I was being lazy.I explained that yes, I was comfortable in bed and that is probably why I asked him to grab me some water in that moment. But I asked because it was something I would appreciate from him, and it would make me happy. Why wouldn’t he want to do that simple gesture? I’m having trouble wrapping my head around his resistance for doing nice things for me.I told him if he asked me to do the same of course I would because I want to make him happy and I know it’s something he’d appreciate. He said he would never ask me to do that though, because he’s perfectly capable of doing it himself.Am I letting my ego show? Please help, I don’t want to be an asshole :(Edit: My own curiosity has gotten the best of me. Those who are commenting, I would love to know if you are currently in relationship. I wonder if this has any baring over one’s opinion? I’ve been getting very mixed responses and am genuinely curious.Edit 2: Someone said I should add this comment I made to give more context since here it is!“Not trying to defend myself (well, I guess by definition I am haha) but when I think about it I do feel I do things for my boyfriend to try and show I care. I’ll clean his apartment when he’s at work, make the bed for him even though it’s not something he does for himself, etc. I think this might be why I didn’t think it was the biggest deal to ask him to do a favor for me.”Edit 3 (and most likely final): A lot more people have chimed into this post than I initially expected. I’ve been trying to respond to people who have (mostly) civil.Wanted to clear a few things up: A lot of people have been mentioning I am “playing mind games” by asking if he could get me a glass of water. While I can’t know for sure if that’s what I was doing subconsciously, I promise it was not that deep lol. It was such a fleeting moment. To me I was just asking a favor, just as he has asked me in other scenarios.I didn’t demand, I asked. And he said sure. A LOT of assumptions are being made about the type of people my boyfriend and I are. If you need more info, just ask me to clarify and I’ll be upfront and honest. It’s crazy to me that people are assuming I “constantly nag” and am “purposefully manipulating” him. Same goes for my boyfriend, please don’t assume he’s a terrible person I should just ditch. After reading through the comments, I think at the end of the day we show our love in different ways. A lot of people have been saying my love language is acts of service and it made sense to me.Edit 4: Forgot to mention another assumption being made. This is my fault for not being clear in the comments. We weren’t laying in bed saying our goodnights with the lights out. We were watching TV and both occasionally getting up to go to the bathroom or something like that. Not sure if this makes a difference for people.",

She rarely cooked, cleaned or care for her children beyond their most basic needs.When the kids were 6(M), 10 (F) and 12(M), she left them all with only one letter behind, stating that she wants to focus more on her happiness, and hopes they'll understand.She also left a big debt (due to her gambling), and the men she borrowed money from, were the type of people that would take your organs if you do not pay.The father was now alone and frustrated. Needless to say his frustration manifested for a long time in horrible ways. He still managed to pay the debt, and keep the kids alive, fed and in school. He latter found himself a great lady, that straightened him up. He was now normal, and the kids became adults and left the nest.The \"mother\" divorced the dad, never paid any child support and left the country 18 years agoWhen she calls them, she only complains about her medical issues and how hard life is for her. She briefly asks about her kids' lives, but then goes back to complaining.The kids hate talking with her, my Andy only answers her call once per year.At the same time she infested the social media with post about how lucky she is to be a mother, how her kids are her life, and keeping her navigating life.After being introduced to her via video chat, she asked for my number and kept asking me about her children's lives through messages.I told her that if she is the amazing mother that she claims to be on social media, she would not need me to inform her about her kids, she would already know everything. But she doesn't, because she abandoned them, was never there for them when they had their own celebrations, traumas or when they were in the hospital (the daughter was about to leave this world, if it weren't for the great stepmom that saw her collapsing and rushed her to ER, discovering a life-threatening condition they were not aware of). I told her that all she does is to complain to them, that the kids see her as nothing more than an acquaints, and that I'm sick of being the one that gets interrogated about their whereabouts. If she wants, she can call her kids herself.She started crying and told me that if this is the case, she will never bother me again.Still, sometimes I wonder if IATA for being so harsh. Was I projecting? Was it too much?I understand that being in an abusive relationship is not ok, and a divorce was necessary, but what triggered me was the fact that she left the kids in a dangerous environment, with an unstable man, collectors knocking at their door, paid nothing for her children, but still had the audacity to call herself a mother and BSing on social media.Was I wrong?",

For context: I (20F) was adopted on the same night I was born, but it doesn't seem to bother anyone in the family on both sides and everybody treated as their own with one exception which is my cousin Lucy (41F).It wasn't always like that, though. It all started almost two years ago when Lucy and I disagreed over a topic on the family's group. She started to try to make points to try to make me look wrong in the group which led to a huge discussion between her and other family members. I had already silenced the group chat. When she saw family members defending me, she started to tell them they'll go to hell and everyone just stopped trying to talk to her because she won't admit any different opnions.Some days after this, my mother came to talk to me about my adoption. I knew right away that someone had told her to talk to me about this. Eventually, my intuition proved to be right and it was Lucy. Also, I found out she was one of the people who helped to handle some of adoption papers and she has this obsession about having a mission with me (this part scared me a bit because of her tone).It ended up with me blocking her on Insta because she was trying to say something like “You have to agree with me and be grateful, because you're adopted” and “You're lucky your parents did things for you even being adopted”. This hurt me deeply and I was really bad for some days. She talked as if I was a second class family member. IDK if it's really because I'm adopted because she has done this to three other cousins who disagreed with her at some point and they're biologically related to her.Either way, it was effed up (my parents don't know about this). A few months after, there was another disagreement on the family chat and I wasn't even going to talk until I saw her nieces humiliating our uncle for his finances and the only reason was he sent a picture they didn't like (and it was really harmless). I didn't answer them, just sent a text saying the obvious: saying things like these about someone is cruel. Then Lucy sent an audio screaming and minimizing my course.My parents and I are starting to plan my graduation party. My mom wants to make me invite Lucy and since the situation last week happened, she pressured me more. We were in my grandma's house in the countryside and she appeared because her mom went to visit. I talked to everyone but I \"didn't\" talked with Lucy. Technically, I did, I just didn't talk much, only answered for education and it was obvious. After it, my parents scolded me. They both said I should forgive everything because she's family. I explained in a calm tone that even though I could forgive her, I don't want to have any type of contact with her.Now they're saying I'm TA and even though my friends and some family members say I finally stood up for myself and I'm right, I'm start to think I might be a bit TA.

I only want one answer questioned, \"Where is all her money\" cause none of it adds up.She is \"always working\" and that's why she can't visit or reply to me, but at the same time she is only working less than 20 hours a week.

Its rude.\"By the way I work hard. Which it isn't like I have a massive income myself. I live okay, enough to pay bills, not starve, and once in a while buy something for myself. And this has been going on for almost a year now. Every time I ask about my sister working, I get blown off, I offer a position at my job cause they need people I get blown off.

My wife, on the other hand, has traveled all over the place, lived in multiple countries, and is always planning the next big adventure.This really hasn’t been an issue for us. I do travel with my wife probably once or twice a year, usually staying a little closer to home. Otherwise, she travels with her family or friends. She always invites me on these other trips but I rarely go. While I miss having her around, it’s a good arrangement. She gets to do something she loves and I get some alone time to unwind at home. She’ll send pictures, we FaceTime, and she usually brings me back some cool souvenirs.All of this to say, there’s one trip she takes every year and I’m starting to get uncomfortable about it. She goes, by herself, to the same place every year and it’s non-negotiable. When she’s there, I hear from her way less than any other trip. She’ll send pics and we FaceTime but less often. When she gets back, she’ll give me snippets of information but I don’t get a full day-by-day run-down.This trip predates me - she first went to this place in college and has been back basically every year since. She’s told me several times how much this place means to her. But my problems are as follows:The trip is non-negotiable. She’s had lots of trips change, get cancelled, or not materialize but never this one.I’m not invited.It feels secretive, like she doesn’t want to share it.This place isn’t not exactly a tourist hotspot. It’s not what you would think of as a vacation destination and there aren’t a lot of sites to see - even according to my wife. So why the need to go back 10+ years in a row if there’s not that much to do?I’ve brought it up to my wife but she can’t see where I’m coming from. The issue being that we have the money, we have the time off work, and we still have a great relationship outside of this. I even asked if I could accompany her some time but she accused me (probably correctly) of only wanting to go to keep tabs on her because I, under any other circumstances, would have no interest in going to this place so, according to her, it’s either my “insecurity or ego” that’s trying to keep her from her passion.I get where she’s coming from but it also seems crazy to me to be deliberately unwilling to include keep your spouse in something like this.",

And as much as I love my Mom, she has been a huge pain about all of it. Everything has been handled by me and my fiancée, but my mom has been constantly by my side these past few months, insisting to know EVERY. LITTLE. DETAIL, and criticizing every choice I made. She will insist I could get something better for cheaper, and fought me on almost everything, including insignificant little things. Which effectively stressed me out more. I’ve tried telling her she’s not helping, but she insists she is (she’s not) and that if it wasn’t for her I would be way more behind (I cannot emphasize how little my mother has done).The final straw came a couple days ago. My step-sister (who we will call Avery, 22F) used to date one of my fiancée’s younger cousins. They dated for over 2 years. It ended horribly a couple weeks ago. She quietly approached me and asked if it would be okay if she did not come to the wedding. Avery loved him with all her heart, and I could tell she was still hurting a lot over it. It would have sent her over the edge to go to a wedding where he would be there, especially when rumor has it he was going to propose. Me and Avery had never been close, and although I wanted her there, it would not have been in her interest to come.But once my mother heard, it was hell. In front of me, my mother yelled at Avery over the phone, calling her an ungreatful b**** and saying she never could support me.  She started criticizing her and demanding she come to the wedding. I literally had to wrestle the phone from her. I yelled at her, saying this was MY wedding and how dare she talk down that way to her own step-daughter, who was hurting so much. My mother said she couldn’t believe I was taking her side, and continued to call my sister names. I very plainly told her that if she could not respect my sister, she would be uninvited to my wedding. She blew up at me, saying that she was the reason this wedding was happening, and I was ungreatful.Thinking about it, I feel bad. My step father has called me, asking me what happened. I told him. A while later, he texted to say my mother was in a fit, and he talked to her about what she had said, and she was planning on apologizing. He basically begged me to let her come to my wedding, that she was acting crazy over not going.But what should I do? How will she react if I don’t let her? Would I be in the wrong here?ADDITIONAL INFO:I asked Avery if she would feel more comfortable if we didn’t invite my fiancée’s cousin. She said she doesn’t want to come at all, she doesn’t feel ready to go to a wedding, even if he isn’t there. She knows his family very closely and said she can’t handle facing any of them yet.  She was cheated on, and they had a harsh breakup, so I can understand why.Me and my Fiancée are paying for EVERYTHING. We are even paying to fly some very extended family out, and bought my mom a very extravagant MOTB dress. She isn’t spending a dime.",

Everyone really likes lasagna and I will make it at least once a month. A couple of month's ago I noticed that a lot of the meal was wasted because the kids were picking the pasta and cheesy bit out of the lasagna and leaving the meat sauce. I noticed a fair amount was thrown away mostly by the kids. ( I have 8 grandkids under 8 years old). The same with the apple pie. The kids picked out some of the apple sauce and left the crust.The following month, instead of two trays of lasagna I made 1 tray of mac and cheese and one tray of lasagna. For desert I had just one apple pie and made cookies for the kids. Everything was finished and hardly any wasted food so i was pleased with my decision.My older son mentioned to me the following week about how him and his wife had discussed that I shouldn't make two types of dishes when I cooked, as the kids need to learn to eat what they are given and not be choosey. This was in reference to dinner the previous week. I noted what he said and this week I made two trays of Mac and cheese and cookies for desert. Everyone ate, and there was just a bit of left over. Barely anything was wasted from the plates. I noticed DIL was just picking at her food but didn't think anything of it. It was also less time consuming for me and a bit less expensive.My son later told me I was an AH for making him come over for mac n cheese.My intention was to really reduce waste as food is so expensive these days. Also the sauce I make from my veg garden in the summer so as there isn't a huge amount and I only use that sause when they come over so I hate to see that wasted. There was also other stuff like soup salad and garlic bread and the time we spend together isn't just about dinner. The grandkids really enjoy being together for half a day.I'm thinking maybe I am an AH because they did drive almost an hour, after packing the 3 the kids up, just to eat mac n cheese when I knew him and his wife really liked the lasagna and apple pie. I also only have everyone over once a week as I cant afford to do this twice a week as I previously had before the pandemic, so i should put in more effort.So am I the AH for not making the expected dish(es) when my son's family took half a day to be with me.",

For some backstory, I have two children and my ex husband and I divorced around 15 years ago, when the kids were young. I have tried to date since, but haven’t had any luck in terms of long term relationships. I wasn’t gonna settle down with just anyone, my kids are my top priority and I’m okay with that.My mother and siblings like to poke fun at me for being single for so long. They had my wedding picture up on the wall for a long time, and recently they put a piece of paper over my ex husband’s face with a sticker saying “open position, inquire inside.” They thought it was soooo hilarious. I, however, was offended and expressed that as such. Despite me telling them that I was in fact not okay with their joke, they left the picture up. I had to see it for months and months, all while biting my tongue to keep the peace. My sister especially likes to make jokes while she’s living in a glass house herself, as she is also divorced. But my mom favors her for whatever reason. There’s no wedding pictures of her up on the wall.For Christmas, I got my mother a bunch of lovely pictures, hoping that she would cave and replace the joke one. She refused, saying she liked that picture. I rolled my eyes. Eventually I got tired of it and took the picture out of the frame. I told her she has many options that don’t make me uncomfortable, and left with the joke picture. I honestly wanted to just rip it up, but I didn’t. I have it at home. My mother called me screaming that I stole from her. And well, I did, but I feel justified due to the fact that I gave her so many chances to just respect how I felt. AITA?",

	"body" : "I’ll just get right into it. About a week ago the man my MIL is married to, Gary, came to my house early in the morning to pick up a steer. That was planned. All be it last minute but I did know he was coming the night before. My husband was at work on this particular day. I was in the barn when Gary arrived. I had every thing ready so he could load and leave. He attempted to make small talk and asked where my daughter was; I said she’s in the house sleeping and I went back in the barn. After several minutes I noticed I didn’t hear the truck start. I went to the house to see him walking out the door. I said, “I would appreciate it if you ask before entering my house.” Yes, I’m sure I had a “tone.” He said he just wanted to say hi to my daughter. I said, “I know.” Because duh. “But it’s MY house.” And walked away, stressing the my but not shouting. I said it all calmly. I sent my husband a quick text saying I’m sorry I’m sure you’ll hear about it. Gary did call my husband and I was informed I will be lucky if they ever set foot in our house again. (I’ll call that bluff.)Context/ history: Gary met my husband’s mom when we already adults and have been together probably 7ish years. So he’s not a “father figure” or anyone we are super close too. They live about 3.5hrs away. My husband also was raised by his grandparents and she did not have custody of him as a child.  For reference, my husband and I have been together since college and married a short 10 yrs.When we first moved in together we rented a house from his mom. But purchased our property 6 yrs ago. I would HAVE NEVER said a word if we still lived in that house because it was hers. Now that we own our house I feel I have that authority.I tend to be over sensitive and easily agitated. So I try really hard to let things slide and not make mountains. I tend not to stand up for myself because I’m probably in the wrong and not looking at all sides. Yes, my distaste for them makes little things seem big. I’m not asking for forgiveness for setting an expectation because I feel setting boundaries can be healthy. I don’t feel this is unrealistic and I’m not looking for an apology from him. He feels he did nothing wrong and per usual I’m freaking out about nothing.My husband says he doesn’t think I’m in the wrong but I’m not sure I believe that. I’m worried he thinks I’m an emotional bitch. I offered to apologize if it would help smooth things over for him but he told me not to worry about it; I just done pissed them off good. I’ve wanted to tell them for years they aren’t welcome here but I never want to hurt my husband. I just want to know my husband isn’t mad at me.Obviously, there’s alot more that brings me to this point but I don’t think anything is relevant to this instance. There are two sides and this is very much just mine. Idk why I’m here other than to ramble.",

They both agreed on split custody over me. Thinks back then were fine, I was entirely ok with going back and fourth and I found it even amusing to spend one on one time with 1 parent at a time. But when I turned 15, my father had met my step mom, she already had kids, 1 boy and one girl, my step brother is 12, my step sister is 8. I don't hate them tho, I don't hold them accountable for anything their mother does. But God, their mother is not really what I expected. Everytime I tried to come over to see my dad, it just so happened she had plans, when I do come over, it's like I'm completely out of the picture. I've tried talking with my dad about how I felt several times.My birthday came up on Jan 1, I was going to stay with my dad for the week, I was really excited to finally spend time with him. But my step mom had other plans. My stepmom bought gifts for her kids, to open on my birthday, when it was time for presents, my dad asked me why I wasn't opening mine. It wasn't the best thing to do but I completely lashed out and started screaming. My step mom said that 'you're from the past, your dad needs to move on, he has a new family now' that really stung tbh. I'm not very proud of this but I will openly say that I said this 'So maybe this is why your last marriage failed' not proud of it but I was angry.My mom quickly came over and picked me up, cause I just couldn't stand to be there anymore. Yesterday I had gotten a text from my dad, and to summarize it up, what he pretty much said was that he wanted to move on and focus on his new family. I feel like I've completely lost a part of me, I have a cool stepdad but now I was losing my actual father, it really hurts. I don't know what to do anymore. AITA, did I goto far?Not really an update but just something fun: me and my stepdad played video games til 12:30 last night, it was pretty epic and calmed me down. He's a really neat guy, and now that I'm most likely gonna lose my bio dad. My step dad will probably fill that void. He's an awesome guy, him and my mom have opposite hobbies but both find each other's hobbies and interests interesting so they try to engage in new things together, my step dad never hides anything from my mom, my mom knows all the passwords to my stepdads accounts, and devices.

He's always had a ton of girlfriends, or just random girls he met at bars over at our place when I was younger, they were always gorgeous and i remember them always spoiling me with sweets, or doing my make up etc.Not too long ago, Liam married a woman (Meg, 36) he had met at work. It's awful, we had to move to her house, which resulted in me having move schools to one where I have no friends. She's always moaning about me. They're also expecting a baby in April, which I am dreading. Meg despises me, I'm pretty sure. She's making me follow all the rules she's created (no make up, no dressing how i want, no diets or going out), and she always talks bad about me to my dad.

I rolled my skirt up a bit and I had make-up as well as fake nails on. She came into my room and started yelling, tell me to put my skirt down and take my make up off, I yelled back that everyone has their skirt rolled up, and that i'm not taking my make up off because most of it is minimal. Besides, Dad did take me to get lash extensions, so I can't just take them out.Liam ended up getting involved, he said to me that i shouldn't rile my step-mam up and just to 'roll the damn skirt down'. I then told him that it's not my fault he's not attractive anymore and had to settle for   Meg, and he shouldn't let her think she's my mam now.Since then, dad's been short with me for insulting him and his wife, and Meg has been even harder on me, saying that they got married because she is a decent, responsible woman and not because she looks like a doll. I've felt a bit bad about it too, because I know Meg's insecure about her looks, and doesn't like thinking about my dad's exes, who were all practically model material.",

Andrew gets invited to all of our group hangouts and shows PDA with Chloe while Jake is acting all casual and sits back talking to us.For the record, Chloe is the one that wants polyamory, not Jake. It's a bigger more complicated picture but I wont go into any more details.Anyways, we handed out wedding invitations and gave one to Jake and Chloe. Chloe asked if she could bring Andrew as her +1. We said \"No, sorry. You ARE the +1 to Jake.\" Long story short, she got upset with us and threatened to not show up at the wedding. We said \"That's fine, you are free to come or not.

However I paid for and organised everything, my brother didn't even come see my dad when he was dying. He kept making up excuses about work even when my dad was begging him.

My mother has been included with readings, lighting candles, and part of the bridal package so all her room, hair, makeup etc is included.My invitation was as my mother's plus one.

My father died 10 months ago, leaving the house to me, and the “right to usufruct”(I used Google Translate for this) to my mother.My main income comes from renting out my apartments (1 3 bedroom, where we lived before, and two one-bedroom) and after my dad’s passing, I started working in a grocery store 3 days a week, 12 hours a day.After my father’s death, my mother’s reign started: she started constantly criticizing me and my kids but in the most petty ways possible. I tried to de-escalate calmly these situations, I even asked her if she wanted us to move out, and I tried to find ways to coexist in peace.At the end of November, while I was, there was a big snow, and my daughters (11,13yo) went out and played in the snow, Mom lost it on them, calling me and them every name in the book, and how we are lucky, that she didn’t throw us out to the streets. The reason: the snow was pretty, and they messed it up, and they would bring mud to the house (they didn’t. They left their boots on the terrace)We had a big fight, and she claimed, she wanted to be finally alone, we’re noisy, we should be more grateful that we don’t have to pay rent to her, etc. I was like okay, we’re moving out.My tenants ended their lease in November in my big apartment, I just wanted to do some minor renovations before renting it out again, but I was like F it, I can live with the stained old carpets for now, and we started to move back. I had to dip into my savings, and my kids got new furniture for Christmas, but it was worth it. We were even lucky with the school, my kids can go to the same class and friends they had to leave behind five years ago.The problem starts from here. Mom got a reality check today when she realized she can’t afford that house. We use coal and gas for heating, and it’s a big old house with old windows and no insulation in the brick walls, so the heating cost is high.  (I planned to renovate it in the spring, but after my income significantly dropped I can’t afford it)Well, the gas bill arrived and it's 70% of her paycheck (she's on gov. assistance and has a part-time job)I was the one paying the bills (and buying the food)She called me today morning and asked me to pay her bills. Of course, I refused. Then she wanted me to pay her rent (for what?) in the end, she graciously offered to let us move back, but I refused that too.Well, she went around the family, and of course, they started calling me about it.  everyone wants me to do something.

I did have to sidestep as they passed me to avoid bumping into the child, but this was a non-event for me.After they had passed me, the mother told her child something like \" Look, that man is angry with you now.\" in a clear attempt to scare the child into calming down. The catch is, she said it in the native language here (Japanese) and I'm clearly a foreigner, she probably assumed I wouldn't understand.I replied in Japanese (in a neutral or perhaps slightly bemused tone) \"No, I'm not angry\" and she gave me a death glare. It was pretty clear she didn't like me saying that.So, I'm, wondering if it was an asshole thing to respond to her?

I think she was under the impression we were on the same “team.”My dad asked what I thought. I told my dad I thought this was fucking ridiculous. That she hasn’t worked in three years and her full time job is begging my parents for money constantly. For things she just wants and doesn’t need. I said she was the most entitled person I’d ever met in my life. Just absolutely went off.Another long story but basically my mom filmed the conversation and sent it to my sister. My sister claimed the things she heard could cause “the end of our relationship” and that she needed space.

I have a pretty strict routine in place each day.I’ve always struggled with my 2 yr old in terms of sleep, he’s my first born and was pretty coddled. Only contact napped, not sleep trained and he wouldn’t put himself to bed at night so either me and my husband would have  to lay in bed with him for like a hr till he fell asleep or else he’d get up and walk out.That all changed since we cut his naps out. Now he goes to bed at 8pm on the dot and all we have to do is put him in bed, give him a kiss and close the door behind us and he’s too tired to even get up.This has saved my mental health tbh as I had so little me time in the evenings.My 10 month old has always been such a good boy, never needed sleep training and he also goes to bed at 8pm and sleeps till 8am.I find a routine really helps so when we was at my friends earlier my 2 yr old got so bored he fell asleep on the couch, it was 6pm. I instantly woke him up, started entertaining him and washed his face with some cold water.My friend said I was cruel to do that and let him be. But even if I left him to sleep for just 30 mins that would set his bedtime back a minimum two hours.She also has 2 babies and doesn’t have a routine at all and they’re often awake until 1am.I told her that used to be me but I just can’t live like that. Yea they don’t go school but a routine is so critical to our family. She always complains about being tired, overwhelmed and stressed whereas I at least get time to play on my ps5, clean my house every night and have a nice bubble bath.She went on to say she’d never wake up her kids and to just let them be.AITA?",

Recently he’s been trying to get me to watch dragon ball and I sat through one of the movies with him, now I watched a little bit of z when I was younger and knew it really wasn’t my type of show. I told him this after we had finished the movie and he asked me why so I explained I wasn’t a big fan of the tropes and he got upset and said that I just hate what he likes.Recently we were chatting with some of his friends over discord and he brought it up in front of them saying things like “yeah I need someone to watch this with because my gf hates it” “She hates everything that I like” it made me embarrassed to have it brought up in front of everyone so I defended myself and he privately texted me that he didn’t know how to talk to me without me getting upset and that it was just back and forward finger pointing.I guess I just don’t understand I really do try to watch some of what he likes. I don’t enjoy superhero movies but we go and watch every one that comes out. I played his favorite game with him for about 2-3 years but he would get upset if I said I wanted to play I game I liked instead (even if I said I’d play it alone) and when he did join he would say the game is bad and he doesn’t know how I play a game like this. Then he would proceed to complain that the it’s the only game I want to play and when I would bring up that he doesn’t have to play it with me he would say that he loves me so he will. One day I pushed back on his complaining and he went quiet and texted me that he was upset that he couldn’t just complain freely without someone combating him.Am I doing something to cause conflict?",

Mostly, my job is doing intakes for kids that are arrested and ensuring the current residents are safe during the night. I work with a partner (60 f) on doing everything we need to do and we have worked together for about 7 years.Currently, we have a resident that is approximately 17 years old. They have never been in trouble before and are in detention for a pretty minor incident but the court systems have complete control over our admits. We have 0 say as a facility. This resident is somewhere near 4-5 months pregnant and is struggling with adapting to the stressful environment (refusing food, not following rules, isolating, constant arguments with staff, morning sickness, stress from dealing with pregnancy/courts/being a teenager, etc) For context, it is my personal belief that this child should not be in detention but again, I have no say over this aspect.This kid can be a handful but is pretty minor compared to our typical resident. They pick and choose when they want to follow rules. One thing they will do is refuse to eat food all day, because detention food isn't the greatest. Then, they will try to manipulate staff to give them additional food. Because it was the holidays, our in house nurse was on vacation and typically it would be nursing staff to set up a food plan for a child that isn't eating properly. Obviously, this type of plan was not in place for this child. .The other night, I was doing my rounds and this resident told me they were hungry and wanted a sandwich. I know from our documentation that they didn't eat a lot during the day. I made the call to give the kid a sandwhich.My co-worker was adamant that the kid was manipulating the situation, wasn't following program rules, and had lost privileges for behaviors earlier in the day. She felt this type of behavior should not be rewarded by letting her have food outside meal times (one of our typical program rules).There is no hard-fast rule on if I'm allowed to give the kids food. It's widely up to my best judgment when making safety calls. I often feed new intakes at all hours of the night because often kids come to us without having a proper meal and I don't want them to go to bed hungry.My co-worker is a stickler for rules and \"teaching kids a lesson\". These kids have all been arrested for a crime and are facing charges. Her contention was that if we don't feed her, she won't refuse food the next day. I'm not new to this job and I knew the kid was manipulating to get food, but to be completely honest I didn't care. I saw this as a medical issue and a pregnant child under a lot of stress was hungry. So I fed then.Am I the asshole?",

The catch is that the trip is estimated to cost $5000. Now, here's the thing I've been dreaming of a multimonth backpacking trip through Europe as a graduation treat to myself ever since I graduated from highschool. I'm expecting to graduate of college this year, and I've saved up $5000 for this dream trip.My girlfriend, who graduated last year and has a full-time job, has saved a lot more money than I have in the past year. Her family is affluent and frequently goes on such trips. However, $5000 is a substantial amount for me, especially since I'm still a student working part-time.This has caused a massive argument between us.

	"title" : "AITA for complaining to my roommate about her visible dirty tampons?",
	"body" : "I live in a fairly large post-grad student house of mixed gender. I share a bathroom with one of my roommates, Eve, and we’re both 25F. Our bathroom also contains the house’s washer and dryer, so even though we’re the only two people using it for bathroom purposes, our other housemates go in and out of it once a week or so.My singular, but constant issue with Eve, is that the way she leaves her used tampons/pads in the trash can, it’s very visible to anyone walking into the bathroom. She never folds her pads or wraps her tampons in toilet paper. Eve uses this trash can OFTEN so it gets full pretty quick and it stays full for far too long. She also never “smushes” down the trash, so these bloody products are usually sitting right at the top of the trash bin, if not slightly hanging over.I started off simply asking Eve to take out the bathroom trash (so I don’t have to risk touching her period products). I would only take it out when it didn’t overflow with bloody pads. But I would still have to look at and smell these products. So eventually I was straightforward and asked her to wrap/cover her used menstrual products in the trash, and that’s when we got into an argument.Eve asked if the guys in the house had a problem with it, and I said that no, it’s me. I told her that they haven’t said anything but I’m sure they don’t love it either. She scoffed and said “so it’s just you that has a problem with it? I don’t see what the issue is then. We’re both women, we both have periods every month. It’s a normal bodily function. What, am I supposed to only throw out my pads in my room?” I said that I don’t expect her to stop using our bathroom bin for it’s intended purpose, but that she should wrap/hide her used products like I do. She argued that I only do that because I grew up with all brothers, and that the rest of the modern world isn’t ashamed of their periods.Since that argument, I’ve been wondering if I am, in fact, behind the times, and that my reaction was uncalled for. That why I think I might be the asshole- because I was raised in a strict and conservative household, while Eve was raised in a loving, relaxed, liberal one. I escaped my family and am trying to break my restrictive upbringing, but at the same time this just seems gross. it’s also true that nobody else in the house has voiced this issue except me. Am I justified in being grossed out and complaining about her behavior? Or do I just have a stick up my ass?TLDR: girl I share a bathroom with leaves her used menstrual products in plain sight. I complained but now I’m not sure if I’m just a prude.EDIT: thank you all for your responses! Apologies for not responding to any- they mostly say the same thing so I thought it best to just add to my post. I’m now looking at buying a trash can with a lid- not only that, but a larger one, so our trash can doesn’t fill up as quick- and hopefully nothing unsavory will be touching the lid!  It’s good to know that I’m not being stuck up or overdramatic, and that my roommate’s practice is, in fact, unsanitary and uncommon.",

	"body" : "Sorry in advance for the long post.Some background: My (29M) girlfriend (25F) comes from a very traditional culture. Dating is generally frowned upon and her family does not know we are in a long term relationship. Because of this, it is common for her to be unable to attend events/travel with my family/friends or invite me to events with her family/friends.For NYE, my girlfriend was going to be celebrating with her community. They celebrate every year, however; due to a death in the family, they were not celebrating this year. We just found out they wouldn't be celebrating about ~1.5 weeks ago. Upon learning this, I told my girlfriend I wanted to celebrate with her because we never get to celebrate, and she responded with \"We'll see, I'm not sure\".I brought it up 2 more times, and she gave the same response. This is normal for us, due to her traditional background. She has to come up with excuses any time she is away from home, so she often doesn't confirm plans with me until 1-2 days before some get together or event. Sometimes, she never updates me, so I wait around to get an answer from her and never receive one until I bring it up.For this situation, my friend informed me earlier this week that he would be doing a get together for NYE. This isn't a \"party\" by any means. Its maybe ~10/12 of us and some significant others. But majority are guys and we've all known each other for years. Its common for us to do cookouts, movie nights, etc together. I told my friend that I would attend his get together, but my girlfriend is unsure if she will be able to attend.My girlfriend is now saying that AITA because I RSVP'd for myself without her, and told them she would \"let me know\" when she can (even though she sometimes never even gives me any answer). In her mind, because I did that, it \"makes no difference whether she's there or not because I already confirmed\" and I \"act like I'm single because I go to these events by myself\". My girlfriend said this as she was on the way to the club to go out with her girlfriends, but says I \"act like I'm single\". I feel like I am not TA because my friend wanted to confirm as many people as possible so they could plan the get together accordingly, and I planned to go to the get together even if my GF couldn't attend, because we originally weren't going to celebrate together in the first place, keeping in mind that this isn't some \"house party\", its a group of ~8 guys that all know each other, and 2 of their girlfriends.

Obviously at her request so when she loses weight she has nice clothes to wear. This has been happening for over 20 years and unfortunately she has only ever gained more weight. So my brother got married in April and I'd bought a beautiful designer dress to wear.

I said I don't mean to be rude but I'd like to sell it because it cost a fortune and im never going to wear it again. Ive given her thousands of pounds worth of clothing that she has never worn because they are still too small and I didn't want the dress stuck in some back bedroom.  She told me I have no faith in her weight loss and I'm being really selfish not gifting her the dress. I stuck to my guns and sold it on fb. Now she's blowing up my phone telling me she needed the dress for her granddaughters 18th birthday party which is 7 months away.
