	"title" : "AITA for saying I'll be driving myself and paying for my own room on the upcoming family vacation so I won't have to be a babysitter?",
	"body" : "I 23m was repeatedly stuck playing the part of helper and babysitter on family outings. I had to move out of my parents' house because I kept being forced to help watch my three nephews. Last year we took a family vacation in summer to the coast. I rode along with my parents, and they paid for my hotel room. Only, I had to share that room with three rowdy boys because my sister and her husband wanted a room to themselves. I was promised time to do my own things on the vacation. But instead I ended up having to help with these kids. I complained to everyone about it, and was reminded I was there for free. And then we pretty much just did only one thing I wanted to do. Which was tour an art gallery. I like doing this whenever I'm at the coast. But the kids find it boring.This year my parents have a beach trip planned for June. And they assumed I'd be riding along the same way as last year. But I refused. I said I'd be driving myself, and paying for my own hotel stay to have my own room. My parents were shocked, and tried to remind me of the cost. I said it was no worry. I've got a good job and a decent running car. I can more than afford it. That's when the \"Buts\" started. I stated the previously listed things as why I'll be driving myself and paying for myself. I want to be able to enjoy this vacation as an adult, and not be treated like a child like last year.My parents told my sister, and she called to blow up at me that I'll be ruining the vacation if I'm off doing my own thing while she has to wrangle her three boys. I ended up yelling at her that last year all she did was rope me into her mess. I didn't really get to do much of anything I wanted to do. And I was treated like the bad guy for wanting to just go to an art gallery. I'm a grown man. I deserve my own vacation too.Now my sister is not speaking to me, and my parents are still trying to convince me to just ride with them to keep the peace. I'm still refusing. But the pressure is getting to me. AITA for not giving in? I know they'll have a pretty hard time when they won't have another person there to help.Edit: It's barely been an hour since I posted. But my sister is apparently a reddit lurker in the mornings, and she saw my post. Not only is she furious with me. But she's also upset no one in the comments is siding with her. To make it short, she went on a big rant about how it's so hard to be a parent to triplets. And the least I could do is help because I'm young and single, and she needs a break. I stood my ground on my decision, and now she's calling our parents to get them involved. I'm expecting a call from them any minute.Update: Well I'm off work now, so I can tell more of what went down. I guess you could say it's over. My sister got our parents involved, they looked at my post, and were absolutely horrified by the continuous influx of commenters. Yes they're very angry with me that I posted here. But I told them that if they'd just listened to me to begin with, I'd have never needed to. I'm sick of the whole keep the peace mentality that sacrifices me to placate my sister. They in turn went off on my sister, and to make a long story short the whole vacation has been canceled. The hotel wasn't booked yet anyway. But my parents are arguing with my sister, my sister is blaming me, and my nephews are crying because they aren't going to the beach. My sister called me at lunch and basically implied I have no life, which is why I have time to help. I recorded that and told our parents, and that's currently what they're fighting about.Smol Update: I wasn't gonna update again. But here's a little more. Parents said that they won't ever push babysitting of my nephews on me again, and have agreed that what happened last year was unfair to me. Right now they're VERY angry with my sister for telling me I should help her because she thinks I have no life. My sister is playing the victim. And my brother in law is basically saying \"Nope!\" to the whole mess and spending most of his time at work.Thank you to everyone who has commented. You made my day.",

She does a lot of orders for wedding cakes that require custard or marmalade fillings, and I offered to help her out by making these fillings at home and bringing them to her so she has less work to do.Unfortunately, the past four times I’ve made these fillings, my girlfriend (F24) has literally dipped her fingers into the filling jars and contaminated them because, in her words, she “just wanted to try some.” I’ve tried explaining to her that she can’t dip her fingers in and contaminate the entire batch, because then I have to remake it. I said she should use a spoon and take some out if she wants to try so bad, but she just pouts and says that she likes using her fingers because it takes her back to her childhood.Today, I was trying to finish some chocolate custard to send it over to my sister really fast because she was running late on a wedding cake order for an important client. I told my girlfriend beforehand to not eat the custard, and if she really wanted to, to please use a spoon.I get out of the shower, and what do I see? She has her fingers in it again! I totally lost it because this is the fifth time she blatantly disregarded what I said, and I yelled at her and told her to “stop fucking eating” the food I’m making, because it’s not for her and she’s contaminating it.She started crying and got mad at me for “fat-shaming” her, even though I made no comment on her weight and she has no history of weight issues or eating disorders. I know I was harsh, but she kept pushing my limits. AITA?",

In our culture education for women is not really valued and she thought that was bullshit.She lived with her father in London where she was educated.

She funded the education of as many of her neices and grand neices as she could.When she passed away she left money for every girl relative she could.My parents managed to access the accounts that were set up for my sister and I.

There was like $13,000 left.I asked my parents about it and they said they had needed the money. I finally found out where the money went. I got furious. I got student loans and moved out. I am a great source of shame to them and I don't give two fucks.I am currently suing them for the money that was left for me. My entire family is against me. They all think I am a complete asshole for airing private family business in public. And that I am putting money ahead of family. My friends are all on my side but they are all Americans and don't really get my culture.  Neither do I to be honest.My brother called me up and offered to pay for my university if I drop the lawsuit. I agreed as long as we had a legally binding contract. He said I was being an asshole for not trusting him. I said he should not have accepted my money for his wedding. It is causing all kinds of embarrassment in our community.I am somewhat ashamed to be doing this but I don't want to have this debt I should not have.",

	"title" : "AITA for calling my mom when my husband refused to listen to me?",
	"body" : "I (26f) recently moved into my first home. I am also 4 months pregnant with our first baby.The pregnancy has been very hard. I have horrible morning sickness. It reached a really bad point where I passed out hit my head and my Dr admitted me to the hospital for a week.When I got home my husband allowed his brothers family to move into 2 of our 3 bedrooms. (They were evicted i dont know why). One room was My office was tossed into our room papers every where. The house was a complete wreck. Trash, dirty clothes, used diapers. I started to cry. It was like a light flipped my husband was no longer the same.  My husband told me it \"wasn't that bad\". My reply was \"fine then you should have the house cleaned up before I wake up.\" Completly exhausted I fell asleep for 4 hrs. I woke up and went to get a drink of water. I couldn't every glass we own is scattered around the house. They didnt clean a single thing. I passive aggressively started to pick up the dirty dishes and washed them.The following morning. I was trying my best to work when their kids were crying non stop. Banging on the walls so on. Their mom was in her room for hours ignoring them.When my husband came home. He was upset with me over how I didn't make his brother's wife feel welcome in our home. By helping with their kids when she was tired. Then continued to complain how nothing was done while he was at work all day in the house. Yep the same one he didn't clean.That lead to a fight where I told him. \"I am too sick to have company and they need to leave\".  To which he replied they are his family and he won't kick them out. I started to cry again.  I was beyond frustrated, exhausted, I physically couldnt do it anymore. I called my mom asking if I could come stay with her. Telling her the whole story infront of my husband. Who at this point was completely shocked, Angry, also I could tell he wasnt sure what to do.My mom came with my brother's (I have 3 older brothers). My mom super angry told my husband. \"Since your family can stay so can we.\" My mom quickly took charge. I was sent to bed. My brother's started cleaning complaining loudly at how disgusting my BIL family is. Along with what a horrible husband my husband is for putting me through this while I am sick.I got a text message from my MIL for calling me an A for not helping my husband clean up the house and putting my BIL in a uncomfortable position by having my mom boss him around.Edited to add update, when my MIL showed up she was super angry outside. I could hear shouting but, couldn't understand what was said. Once inside she was shocked. My house looked really bad. My BIL lied to her about what happened. My MIL quickly started to help my mom in the bossing mode. My house is not just cleaned but deep cleaned.My BIL and his kids are now staying with MIL. She didn't know about the eviction. My in-laws helped them financially a couple of months ago. My MIL was not happy about it.SIL refused to come out of the bedroom. She would scream through the door but that was about it until her family came to pick her up. Last little bit. I did talk to my husband. He seemed very remorseful. I asked for some space he is staying at a hotel. He asked to come by and talk to me tonight.My mom and dad are here. Both mom's felt like I should have someone here since I am sick. Both moms have set up a meal plan. Where they trade off who will bring in dinner. It was my MIL idea. Thank you for all your advice. I truly appreciate it.Talk with husband: summed up since it lasted 4 hrs.  it was a hard talk.  He is remorseful. Bil was only supposed to stay for a couple of nights. Then leave originally he thought they would be gone before I got home. He said he is tired and emotionally upset himself. When I originally passed out. My husband left to help a friend move. He came home and found me. He said he has no idea how long I was on the floor hurt. He was originally scared I had died. Since then he has had nightmares. On top of dealing with his family drama. He admitted to dumping his frustration onto me. When it's not my fault. He begged me for another chance. The next steps. We are still separated. He plans on staying at my brother house in his casita. We are going to go to marriage counseling and Individual counseling. He asked if he could come when the home health nurse comes each night and to my Dr's appointments. I agreed to that.Update on BIL: his wife admitted to having and affair. She told him she got married too soon and doesn't want the responsibilities of being a mom anymore. I am not sure what will happen with him and his kids but, I am shocked that she feels this way especially with her kids.",

	"body" : "I've been married to my wife Beth for 5 years. I have a bio daughter named Jessica (she's 18). And I also have two stepdaughters named Monica and Leah. They're 25 & 28. Both are single moms and live with us currently.there's been issues about my stepdaughters asking my daughter to babysit the kids. Jessica didn't have a problem with it at first since this is what she does to earn money but since her stepsisters don't pay her much, she'd just refuse to babysit. We worked this out by having my wife take care of paying for the babysitting.I planned a family vacation for 3 days and everyone wanted to go. However, Both Monica & Leah suggested that Jessica stay home and watch the kids since Beth doesn't want her grandkids to come. They said it's because the kids are used to Jessica and hiring another babysitter would cause issues. And also said that Jessica isn't too \"fond\" of our destination but it was obvious that Jessica wanted to go. They insisted and Beth offered to pay her double and there was just..a lot of back and forth on this til I demanded they stop bringing it up.We were supposed to go last week but when everybody had bagged their bags and was time to go, Jessica found out that she didn't have her passport on her. We searched her bag then went home and searched there. Beth and my stepdaughters kept insisting that we go back to the airport or else we'd miss our flight. They insisted that Jessica stay at home with the kids. They even told the new babysitter to go home cause she was no longer needed. I refused to go and kept searching for the passport til Monica admitted that she helped Leah hide Jessica's passport to get her to stay home with the kids. I was livid I tried to get her to tell me where it was but she said Leah had it, Leah denied so I threatened to cancel the vacation that's when they gave it back. I decided to actually cancel the vacation and blew up at both of them and berated them. They stayed upstairs for a while and Beth refused to speak to me and said that I punished my stepdaughters for worrying about their kids and wanting them to stay with someone they know. I got told I overreacted and ruined the trip for everybody.Editing to mention that kicking my stepdaughters out isn't possible since my wife co-owns the house that we currently live in.",

	"title" : "AITA for not letting my miracle baby niece be my flower girl at my wedding?",
	"body" : "My (27F) older brother and SIL (both mid 30's) just welcomed their first child a year and a half ago, after YEARS of trying. After many failed attempts, SIL was told that she wouldn't be able to conceive due to a medical condition she has, they finally got pregnant.Since having my niece, the baby has been the center of attention at EVERY family even we've had since she was born. Birthday's, wedding's, family get togethers, you name it. Now don't get me wrong I LOVE my niece, but it can get to be a little too much when my SIL goes on and on about how long they tried to conceive, complications they've had, miscarriages they've had etc. Like a little TOO much info. Many family members have commented on how it's a little bit excessive, but no one has said anything because they don't want to sound like an AH.Anyway I'm getting married in the spring and my brother and SIL approached me last weekend about having my niece be the flower girl.Now my fiancé (35M) has two children (10M and 6F) from his previous marriage. His son is one of his groomsmen while his daughter had asked to be our flower girl when we told them the news that we were getting married a year ago, as it's something she always wanted to do, so of course we said yes.So I explained this to my SIL when she asked me about my niece. She asked if my step daughter can just carry my niece with her? I said I don't think she'd be comfortable with that considering she's 6.She then asked why I can't give that role to my niece, and allow herself to carry my niece down as the flower girl? I said no because I already promised my step  daughter.She then starting going off about how my lack of effort to incorporate my niece is disgusting to her. I should \"honor her\" in some way since I know how long and hard they tried for my niece.Now I may sound like an AH for this but I kind of got fed up and snapped and said\"Incorporate my niece how? By the time the wedding comes around she'll be 2 years old. The ENTIRE family already knows your story about how long and hard you guys tried for her. What more do you expect me to do to honor her?\"She started crying and said that clearly I don't love my one and only niece and I'm \"letting her down\". I said of course I love my niece, and obviously she's going to be involved in pictures and stuff. But I'm not going to let my step daughter down by giving my niece a role she's too young to remember anyway.Well now SIL and my brother are pissed off with me for not letting my niece be flower girl, and are running around telling the rest of the family I don't love my niece. My mom had been trying to stay neutral but thinks my step daughter would understand if I explained to her I need to give that role to my niece.I'm firm in my decision though, and my fiancé is thankful that I didn't let his daughter down.

	"title" : "AITA for wearing a wedding dress at a wedding?",
	"body" : "So my friend 20f and I 19m have been friends for a few years and she recently got engaged.A week ago I got a dm from her for a small costume party she was hosting as a celebration for her getting engaged. I asked if there was a theme and she said there wasn’t. I’m a cosplayer so I had a lot of choices.I didn’t want to rock up in an anime cosplay, so I thought it would be funny to go to an engagement party as the Corpse Bride. I arrived at her house yesterday and everything seemed normal. A few people complemented my costume and I was having a lot of fun.After ten minutes my friend’s fiancé walked out in a black tuxedo and announced this was actually their wedding. Apparently my friend saw a video of someone doing this and wanted to do the same.He asked us all to go to the back yard for the ceremony to begin. I went straight to him. I asked him if I should quickly go home and change my outfit and that I would get back before it started. He told me it was fine since I didn’t know this was the wedding.I trusted him and followed everyone outside. They got married and everything seemed good. The reception was just in their house again so everyone just walked back inside and picked up where they left off. I tried talking to my friend and celebrating with her but she kept making excuses to not talk to me.I assumed it was just because she was tried from the big day and wanted some alone time. I didn’t bother her after that and the party soon ended.I got home and half an hour passed when my phone started getting notifications. I checked and it was my friend texting me. She was cussing me out and telling me how I ruined her wedding. I was really confused and asked what I did.That only made her more angry. She told me it was basic knowledge not to wear a wedding dress to a wedding. I reminded her I had no idea it was a wedding and that I asked her now husband if I should change and he said it was fine.She didn’t respond, but I got a text from her husband. He asked why I would tell her he said it was fine. I told him he said it was fine. Then he said how I should have changed anyways and it’s my fault that the two are now fighting over this.I’ve tried texting her that I wad sorry and if I had known I wouldn’t have done it. I woke up today and saw her and her husband have blocked me on everything.So, AITA for not changing out of the wedding dress when I found out it was actually a wedding?Edit: I am a guy. I cosplayed the character Emily from The Corpse Bride and had blue paint all over. I’m also Australian and I’ve never heard a costume party meaning fancy. Everyone was dressed up in funny costumesUpdate: https://www.reddit.com/user/DanWantsDeath/comments/11l42nb/update_aita_for_wearing_a_wedding_dress_to_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf",

	"title" : "AITA for not giving my sister her wedding dress because she didn't invited my underage son?",
	"body" : "I (40m) have a sister (30f) who is getting married in a week. The groom proposed to her a year ago at a family dinner that left everyone speechless, but very happy for them as they are longtime companions. During this dinner, my sister asked my son (17m) to make her wedding dress. My son has always loved design and fashion, he took technical courses in these areas and sewing, and even his friends keep asking for his clothes because they are so beautiful. He agreed, but said that he needed time and that he would need her opinion constantly.At first my sister was very annoying. My son drew about 50 dress designs in a month and she only liked one, which he continued with. He sewed it with great quality fabric which I paid for as I wanted to get involved in a certain way. For five months he made several adjustments to suit her wishes, as she always complained about something. After a while, he arrived at the final model and it was just amazing. My mother cried seeing my sister in the dress and I confess that I almost got emotional too.The problem was that last week my son came to talk to me about the wedding invitation that had not arrived for him, but for other family members. I thought maybe he didn't need one, but it still felt weird. I messaged my sister raising this issue and she replied that she didn't want any underage people at her wedding because there would be alcohol. I asked if she was going to make an exception for my son, but she cut me off and said no.There are no children in our family, my son is the only minor, so I didn't see any sense in this rule for family members. And to make matters worse, my son was very sad and cried because he spent months on this dress and couldn't go to the wedding. I was very upset and told my sister that she should look for another dress as soon as possible, as she would no longer wear the one my son made.She called and yelled at me, saying I was being unreasonable and that I couldn't do this. My mother called me saying I should deliver the dress and follow the rules, but I didn't and hung up on her. Because of this, the family is divided. Many agree with me and condemn my sister's action saying she could only make an exception, but another part says I'm unreasonable and I'm spoiling her big day.I don't think I'm being wrong but just rational and paying her back in kind. So AITA?UPDATE:first I would like to thank all the comments and suggestions, I really didn't expect my post to resonate so much.I talked to my son about the suggestions you guys gave me and he agreed to sell the dress at market price. He calculated the price of everything and the value was quite high. We sent the proposal to my sister and she hated it. She said she couldn't afford it because it was too expensive and it should be a gift because \"she is family\". I responded by saying that it was too easy to say she was family to get a free dress, but not enough to include my son. She cried on the call and begged me not to ruin her day, but I didn't call because that to me was bullshit.At no point did she offer to just let my son go or apologize for it.And for anyone who said that maybe she's homophobic, I'm not sure, but I think who could be influencing her is her fiancé who is a Christian and has never been close to my son. However, I don't care if he's doing it or not. If she wants to exclude my son from this event then she will also be cutting ties with me.And for those who are asking for a photo of the dress, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but my son didn't agree and unfortunately I won't post it because of that.If anything else happens I'll let you know, until then, thank you all!",

	"title" : "AITA? I didn’t attend my son’s wedding, I instead spent the evening with his ex wife.",
	"body" : "Quick backstory, after graduating high school my son moved 3 states away for college. At 19 he married a girl he met, I tried convincing him to wait because I personally felt he was too immature. They both dropped out and moved back here to his home town. At 20 they had their first child, a beautiful little girl. 16 months later, my DIL gave birth to their second child, a little boy.After the first baby, my wife and I noticed our DIL wasn’t happy. We both thought it was PPD related. Just after the second arrived, my son and his wife separated. She would bring the kids over for a visit, it was then she began unloading on us. I know there’s two sides to every story, but considering I know my son, I believed her. I sat my son down numerous times to speak with him regarding his marriage. He refused to take responsibility, blamed her for everything even when I directly pointed out where he was the sole problem.They got into counseling, for a year things were ‘ok’ on the surface. Our DIL filed for divorce, my son 3 days later was on Facebook announcing his new girlfriend. A month later, they were engaged. My son had forced his then wife to become a permanent SAHM at the birth of their first child. She of course had no other family or friends here, she knew no one aside from us. She had nowhere to go with two small children. Unbeknownst to our son, my wife and I helped her financially and got her an apartment.Before the divorce was even finalized, we received a wedding invitation. I made it clear to my son, I would not be attending and they would not have my blessing. His mother told him she would see to it that I would attend. I stayed consistent in my decision, I also asked him not to bring his fiancée around our house out of respect for the mother of his children.The wedding happened on Feb 11. The night before, my wife gave me the finial push. I did not attend. Our daughter, also did not attend for the same reasons. My wife picked up our grandkids, got them dressed and attended the wedding. My daughter and I decided to spend the evening with his ex. I couldn’t imagine her sitting alone, while her kid’s attended their father’s wedding.She was taken aback that I didn’t end up attending his wedding. We took her out to distract her mind. I just wanted her to know, she’ll always be considered family to us. My daughter also made a joke they can drop the in-law status and just be sisters now. She was very tearfully grateful, I realized just how badly she needed our support and specifically on that night.The next morning, my son called to tell me how much of a horrible father I am for not attending his wedding. Few days later he caught wind that I spent the wedding evening with his ex. He said that was the ultimate form of betrayal, and further myself and his sister would have to earn an relationship with him on his terms only.*****ETA: First, I’d like to sincerely thank each and everyone of you for your support, encouragement, and all the awards. I know without a doubt, I did the right thing. I even feel differently now, his mother should not have attended either. But we can’t go back and undo that.So, my son saw the post. I had sent my daughter the link yesterday so she could read the comments. This morning she texts me at work…DAD YOU WENT VIRAL! Lol But anyways, he sent screenshots of the post and all my comments to his mom. He also told her…”He’s dead to me now.” Time will tell if he means that. I’m sure he’ll see this update too. For that reason, I’m positively certain the second he needs another cash loan I won’t be dead anymore.His mom told him, “Your children have to be our number one priority.” They’re not just some disposable items you can leave behind when one chapter of your life closes. Maybe one day, he’ll understand this.",

He claimed she just bolted away from him in the park, into some bushes and he could not find her.Our dog is quite small, a mini poodle mix and almost 13 years old, she is still active but it is really unlike her to run away from us and I was suspicious but chose to believe my husband and me and my daughter were in grief but did not want to blame him.When we came back home, he seemed surprisingly ok unlike us. Ever since the pandemic, my husband started working from home and he has always been annoyed at how much attention we gave Ellie and hated how Ellie begged to sit on our laps and his while he worked.A few days later we got a call from an animal rescue in a neighboring state quite far from us that she had been found. I picked the phone and it was on our landline which we almost never use these days but was the contact on the microchip.I told my husband and he just said \"that is great, I am so happy\" but it felt kind of blunt and insincere. I said it is strange that she got so far and he responded that someone must have stolen her and then abandoned her. This made little sense to me as to why that would happen.When he was out drinking with his buddies, I copied the videos from his dashcam for the days I was away and saw that he had indeed taken Ellie far out of state, and clearly dropped her in front of his car thrown a frisbee like object into a field, yelled fetch and drove off without her.I was livid and confronted him and he just stupidly muttered how he dropped her there so she could find a farm and have a better life and then the next day got really angry at me for viewing his dashcam and called me an my daughter AHs.",

	"body" : "UPDATE POSTED ON MY PAGEThis happened last night but my phone is still blowing up.I F(26) dipped into my savings and got Mike, my boyfriend (27) a PS5 for his birthday yesterday.He knew he was getting the PS5 because he told me that the PS5 is the only thing he wants. We’ve been together for 4 years so the cost didn’t matter. That is until, I found out what he thinks about me.Some background: When I was 18, I was involved with Jake, a guy who I met online. We ended things after 3 months, and I moved on shortly after with Adam, a guy from work.I found out a couple months later that Jake and Adam were actually really close friends but I didn’t know Jake long enough to meet his friend group, so I had no idea.After finding out, I took some time off dating and two years later, I met my current boyfriend Mike.I was upfront and honest with Mike about my past and the fact that I was unintentionally involved with friends. He said he understood and my past didn’t bother him.Last night at his party, I showed up with the PS5 and him and his friends were screaming with joy.His best female friend Jessica laughed and said “I wish I was a thot so I could afford a PS5 too.”I looked at her with an “excuse me?” Look on my face and she just said “nevermind” and walked away.I confronted my boyfriend about it and he said and I quote “she’s just messing with you. You can’t take a joke?”So I pushed further as to why this girl is even calling me names to begin with and he said “well, everyone knows you were a thot before you met me.”I asked him to explain how I was a thot before him and he said “you know…messing with best friends?”He then pat me on the shoulder and said that it’s okay because I’m not who I was back then and if he could get over my “colourful past” and “thot mentalities” to give me a chance, then I could get over Jessica’s comments and give her another chance.I didn’t say anything. I just got up. Took the PS5 from the gift table and left.He was PISSED. He literally called me like 20 times, but I didn’t care. I was so hurt that I took the bow off and took it straight back to the store I got it from. They happily refunded it.I thought that was done but Mike and all his friends including Jessica are berating me for being petty and they’re all saying I brought this on myself by making poor choices.I responded to Mike and told him that he deserves better than me so find someone who wasn’t a “thot” and get the PS5 from them because I returned it.He started screaming how I’m “the biggest AH” for returning it and how I should be happy he ignored my “colourful past.”I’m thinking maybe taking it back went too far.AITA?",

I finally shut it down after she offered me 100$ to let her try it on. Her reasoning for presisting so much? She says it's because of her \"love\" for wedding dresses and her obsession with them.Fast forward to yesterday, I came home from work early and I found my fiance at home. He freaked out after seeing me and tried to prevent me from going into my room while trying to text somebody on his phone. I opened the door and was shocked to see his mom standing there wearing my dress. I instantly pulled out my phone and took a photo of her in it. Sheand my fiance freaked out after I told her that she needed to pay me for a new dress in 3 days or else I'll show the whole family the photo. She started crying and then left and my fiance blew up at me saying I can't be serious and that I overreacted because his mom just wanted to try the dress on, no harm done. But I refused to listen to him because in my opinion, the dress should only be worn by the bride and the bride only. quite frankly, I felt disgusted looking at the dress again, I don't want it anymore. And so I think it's fair that she pays me after she ruined it for me. He yelled at me. and told me to wake up and stop treating his mom like that as if she was an enemy. We had a fight after he failed to get me to back down and he's been staying with his mom since then.I felt awful, but I spent 3k on this dress and worked hard .to get it, I can't stand looking at it but people in my family think I'm escalating things and risking my relationship with not only FMIL but my fiance as well.AITA?Update: Oh My God! This blew up, and so I thought I'd add some updates. My fiance called and offered to pay for the dress himself so we can \"end the conflict\" but he wants me to :hand him my phone so he can delete the photo himself.Swear that I don't have any copies to \"use\" against his mom later.Apologize to his mom.And lastly, He asked that I quit his family group chat and log out of facebook for at least a month.I haven't responded yet.P.s He called with this offer/conditions hours ago but I didn't want to include this in the post but now I did. Also, I'm not sure if I'll agree because I don't want him to pay for it, I want his mom, the one who wore it to pay for it. Not being vicious but trying to hold her accountable.",

I make enough from part time to pay for school and put money aside. My siblings range from 20-10.Both of our parents work full time. I have taken on a lot of the responsibilities for keeping everything running in the house.  I do the grocery shopping, the laundry as well as making suppers and doing meal prep so everyone has lunches ready to take every day. I also get all my siblings to do their part with regards to household chores.  For example my youngest brother is responsible for feeding and walking the dogs.  So I make sure that there is dog food in the storage and poop bags on the leash.My dad works very long hours and my mom works 9-5 at a hard job.Over Christmas I had a chance to buy a PS5 for myself so I did.  The rest of my family is still using a shared PS4.  I keep mine in my room and I do not share.My parents started fielding complaints from my oldest brother about how I made so much money and I don't share the things I buy for myself.  Totally true.  So they had a talk with me where they brought this up.  I pointed out how much of the household work I did and they said it wasn't fair that o was earning so much money without contributing. They told me how much they expected from me.I went to my room and did the math.  If I gave them what they wanted I would have about $800 a month left over.  If I dropped a couple of classes next semester I could go to almost full time hours with my employer and and it would only be one more year until I graduated with my second degree.  But I could afford my own place and I would have way more free time and disposable income.I packed up and moved out. Everything I owned fit in my car.  I stayed at an Airbnb for two weeks until I could get everything sorted with an apartment, school, and work.  It was great.I'm not going to lie I may have gone a little overboard on Tinder.  I couldn't have women over to my parents house.I just moved into my own apartment.  I'm staying part time until I finish this semester.  I will work full time over the summer and go to a lighter class load/higher work hours in the fall.My oldest brother has been tasked by my parents to do everything I used to do.  His chores have been split up with the other three.  They are all pissed at me for moving out.My parents are upset that I left them in the lurch.  My siblings are mad that they all have more chores.  My oldest brother is especially salty because he has no free time to see his girlfriend and she isn't allowed in the house when my parents aren't home.I'm enjoying my free time.  I bought myself a plant from IKEA.I feel bad for screwing them all over but it didn't make sense for me to do all that work and pay rent on top.All the chores were split fairly.

I said she could play for a few minutes, and she ran off to play. I was waiting next to this other parent, who we’ll call Debra.

How are they bothering him?She then proceeded to start talking about how her son was complaining about my daughters lunches smelling terrible, and that he thought it was disgusting.

My son shouldn’t have to put up with whatever crap you make your daughter bring to this school.

He's a quant PM and makes like 10x what I make (and I make a good salary haha!). As we've grown wealthier, I've learned that people become nosier. Friends, acquaintances, relatives, you name it. In the beginning I would entertain the nosy questions, but since I turned 30, I've adopted a \"take no shit\" attitude. When people ask me how much he makes, I no longer say anything. I've learned the hard way that giving an exact number can have bad consequences.My co-worker, 25, is new and she already has quite the reputation. Very chatty, catty, gossipy, you get the gist. You can just tell she craves wealth and status. She wears a bunch of flashy designer items and is always asking the ladies around the office which of the men are single.Last Friday, our office hosted an afternoon happy hour. She approached me and asked how me and my husband's recent vacation to Europe went. I told her it went well and briefly summarized what we did. Then the conversation went something like this:Her: \"So what does your husband do?\"Me: \"He works in finance.\"Her: \"Oh wow, he must make a ton then to be taking you on all these lavish vacations! I hope you don't mind me asking, but how much does he make in a year??\"Me: \"Yes, we're very lucky that he makes a good salary.\" Polite smileHer: \"Oh c'monnn I won't tell anyone. How much does he rake in a year? Millions??\"Me: Awkward chuckle \"I'd rather not say, but it's up there!\"Her: \"What, he doesn't allow you to give an exact number or something??\"Me: Visibly annoyed \"No, I just prefer not to say.\"Her: Laughs in my face \"You'd think the stuck-up one would be the one with money, not the one without!\"Me: \"You should learn how to take 'no' for an answer and when to quit being a nosy bitch. It's a valuable lesson.\"Then I smiled at her and walked away. Later on, I had a few co-workers reach out to me and say that she was crying and left early and that I should apologize for calling her a rude name. I refused. I told my mom and she said I was too rude to the new girl and that she's young and might not fully understand \"salary talk\". I think she's old enough.

Furthermore, I am at a highly prestigious university and I haven't really gotten along with the guys on my course. They are all very competitive and I just don't really enjoy their company - everything turns into a pissing contest, and they definitely take me less seriously because I'm a woman. I stopped interacting with them beyond the mere minimum and choose to hang out with other people.Anyway:I did well in our recent exams (I topped two out of four exams we had so far). Our prof congratulated me during class (I wouldn't have advertised this myself). Ever since then, my interactions with a specific group of male classmates have gotten weird. They're now outright rude and challenge me aggressively in class discussions. We recently had some presentations and one of them chose to do theirs on, to put it simply, \"pretty privilege\" - they specifically pointed to two papers that suggested that pretty female students get overscored in assessments. The other guys in the group snickered and one even gave me a wink. Afterwards, I heard them in the hallway joking that \"they had experience with that themselves\".I've been seeing a PhD student within our department for a month. He has literally nothing to do with our course. Well, we ran into one of my course mates A together. The next day in class his friend B asked me if \"my boyfriend\" helped me with exams. He said this intentionally loudly and in front of the professor, who heard this. I replied that I don't have a boyfriend (cause he's not my bf), but then B pointed out that he had run into me with the PhD student, making a point to say his name (the prof knows him). I just replied that we're only friends.They didn't let up - I heard that they discussed this thing in two more classes, in earshot of the professors. Both times they suggested I got help for my exams ( I wasn't even seeing him then). I didn’t confront them, but this has been causing me so much anxiety - even without the exam accusations, I worked hard to get here and I don’t want to be known among the faculty for my dating life.I raised this issue with my supervisor, without the intention of taking it any further, but I wanted her advice as a woman in academia. She convinced me to let her email their supervisors \"to remind them of proper conduct\" and described their treatment of an \"unnamed female student\". She didn't name me, but they figured it out. They confronted me after class and asked my why I would report their “silly joke“. Apparently, their supervisors are now very cold towards them and less interested in helping. It’s not a formal complaint - only their supervisors know - but one of them, C, said his supervisor writes the reports for his financial aid/scholarship and it was my fault if he lost out on that.I now feel a bit embarrassed and this was compounded by a friend telling me I took it to far cause C shouldn't lose out on his scholarship.

This was never a concern to me as his mom did the laundry.Unfortunately she is sick right now so I have taken over the household chores that she used to handle.  My son is still responsible for his and I do mine as well as hers.First day I did laundry I gagged and almost puked from his underwear.  If he were three and not fully potty trained I might understand how they end up like this.  But he is a healthy young man.  He should not be leaving his ass this unwiped.I talked to him about it and he said he would make an effort to do a better job.  Nope. No change in the situation.  So I went to the hardware store and installed a wand bidet in the bathroom he uses.  We already have one in ours.  I told him that he has a choice of either using the bidet or washing his own underwear.  He doesn't know how to use the washing machine and he refuses to do them by hand.He started going commando.  Which just meant the problem was his jeans now.So I said that we might need to take him to the doctor to see what is wrong with him.  If it's physical or psychological.  I also said that the next time his friends were over I was going to ask them is they left their underwear in the same condition.  I WOULD NEVER ACTUALLY EMBARRASS HIM LIKE THAT. He said I was being an asshole and he called his mom to tell her what I was doing.  She said that he was just like that and I could deal with it until she was better.I don't think that's a great plan.  If this kid never learns to wipe his ass he will be bereft of a sexual partner without a poop fetish.

He was SCREAMING at me, BLAMING ME for not showing up (uninvited still) to the proposal with her parents because she was upset they weren’t there… I was fucking slack jawed.I told him I knew this would happen, and He says VERBATIM “you just admitted you knew this would happen, so If you knew the whole time and you actually cared about her, you would have invited them.”I was Gob smacked and hung up on him. Not even an hour later I get a call from her asking me to come to her parents. According to her, this is how the situation played out: he popped the q, she said yes and the people he invited popped out from hiding. She was bombarded by 4 of his guy friends, his mom, dad, older brother and his sister in law. His parents were holding a sign that read “welcome to the family, Mrs.(insert his last name here)” and this is where things go down hill.I did not know this before (and I thought I knew everything), but my friend doesn’t want to change her last name, and she’s told him that repeatedly since they got together. She’s an only child from a Ukrainian family and with everything going on with Ukraine in the last year she’s doubled down.When she saw the sign she joked “Mrs.(his last name)? I think you mean Mrs.(her last name)!” Everyone went silent until his mom said “Well the ring is already engraved, no changing it now!” She takes the ring off and see’s “Mrs.(his last name)” engraved on the band.Then she asked if her parents were coming. He gave every excuse: He didn’t have their number, there were too many people there, he wanted to keep it private and eventually said “This was my proposal to you and now My family is your family. We can just send your parents the pictures later.”SHE TOOK THE RING OFF AND LEFT. That’s when I’m assuming I got that call from him. She went straight to her parents. She asked them about the engagement, they were clueless. She then asked if I knew anything. I asked if she was in the right place, she said she was, so I told her I would answer any question she had (rather than dumping everything on her).She was upset but thanked me. She was furious when I told her about the call from him earlier and said “does he really think I’m that shallow?” She said it wasnt about having a perfect proposal or her parents there, it was about him making the whole thing about himself as always and she was done feeling ignored and belittled. So this was her breaking point.She’s staying with her parents currently and has been receiving texts from him. The worst one so far is him telling her she has to pay him back for the ring and for ruining his life. Right now, all I can do is be here for her, and whatever decision she makes, I will fully support because, as you’ve all helped me realize, this isn’t about me, it’s about her. Not my monkey, not my circus.Edit: she gave him the ring back when she took it off, I didn’t include that because I was at the 3,000 character limit already.EDIT 2 (update): I did not mention this plan when I originally posted just in case her ex found this thread, but I can report now that we got a heads up last night that he wasn’t at their apartment, so we ran over and got most of her shit out, at least all the really important stuff.

That being said I am one of the youngest people in family and my protests mean literally nothing.Some of those women choose not to cook, however this is usually met with a level of ostracizing. The women who don’t cook are lives and long term girlfriends. So they kinda already have a good family relationship doctored in. When I have seen new partners not cook, it’s gone bad. Like completely ostracized, not speaking, cattiness, rudeness etc.This dinner will be in two weeks and my girlfriend was asked if she would attend. Initially she said yes, which is great. I want for her to meet everyone and for everyone to get used to her being around, but when I explained to her the tradition she was understandably bothered.I told her that I understood where she was coming from, however it was best for everyone if she just played along. I told her this isn’t a permanent thing and that I am only asking her to do this so that she can avoid bad treatment from the rest of the family.

She told me that if I think it’s acceptable to make her do this I’m just as bad as everyone else, while my point is that she needs to make a good first impression.AITA?",

	"body" : "My brother Tom (36m) and I (26f) have never had a really solid relationship, due to our age gap we didn't spend much time and by the time I was old enough to develop a personality he was moved out of the house.For the last two years my brother and his fiance Sarah (32f) have been planning their wedding. And it's coming up in September. I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I figured i was only asked as a courtesy since I'm her soon to be sister in law but I still took it seriously. I have been a bridesmaid for the last two years. Just a few weeks ago I managed to save up to buy the 800 dollar bridesmaid dress. Over all in the last two years between group outings to parties, dinners,  lunches, clothes, etc… I spent thousands of dollars. Eventually all the girls in the wedding and I became extremely close and I started to get hyped for the wedding.Sarah recently got close with her brother's wife Becky (30f). Last week she dropped the ball on me that she no longer wants me to be a bridesmaid and she would prefer if Becky would take my place.It broke my heart a little but it's her wedding and it's not my place to tell her how to run it so I said it was fine. Yesterday I went to my brother's house to pick up the bridesmaid's dress, and was going to see if I could return it since it was within the time frame.Sarah was completely appalled and said that Becky was going to wear it since she and I are the same size.I said that would be fine, but they would have to pay me the 800 for it. Sarah said that Becky couldn't afford and I should just be nice and let her use it and said that I could keep it after the wedding.I explained that I'm not just giving away the dress, and I'm not ever going to usei after the wedding. After some bickering back and forth I just ended up taking it and leaving.My brother and Sarah tried to compromise with me, and say I could be \"the assistant flower girl\" and I felt offended at the offer. After I said no, they then said that Becky could give me 250 bucks for it. Again no and I returned the dress and got a full refund.I told them I understand that it's their wedding but they are being extremely disrespectful to me and I don't need to deal with it and I'm not going to the wedding.Today my coworker says she has an extra round trip plane ticket to go to Miami that she'll sell to me for half price plus I would have to pay for half the hotel and I can go hang out with her in Florida. The only downside is that I'll be in Florida for the week of my brother's wedding.So will I be the asshole if I just go party in miami instead of going to my brother's wedding?",

	"body" : "My (31M) sister Anne (34F) got married on Saturday. My husband of 7 years, Mark (32M), was there with me and up until one point, is was an amazing evening.After the ceremony, Anne wanted a picture with all of our siblings (there’s five of us) and their respective partners so we started lining up.When Anne saw that my husband was standing next to me, she shook her head and said something about him \"ruining the aesthetic\". Apparently, her plan was to put one man and one woman next to each other alternately.My youngest sister (18F), who doesn’t have a partner and was standing on the very side, offered to stand between the two of us, so we could be close and Anne’s wish would still be respected.I thought that was a great solution, but Anne disagreed and told Mark to get out of the picture. He’s quite introverted and tries to avoid confrontation under all circumstances, so he simply complied and told me not to get angry, but it was obvious that he was hurt and disappointed by being left out.Obviously, it didn’t stop me from getting angry and I walked away with him. I can understand that Anne wants her wedding pictures to look exactly how she imagined them, but I think that the idea my younger sister proposed was very reasonable.I congratulated Anne and her husband one last time, but then I said my goodbyes. When I was asked why we were leaving early (especially before taking the pictures), I said that I didn’t feel like our presence was wanted.We left before dinner was served and I took Mark out to his favorite restaurant to cheer him up a little.Anne has texted me since saying that I was being overdramatic and making a fuss over nothing. Our parents have tried to remain neutral, but expect for my youngest sister, the rest of the family supports Anne and thinks that leaving early was going too far and that I should’ve sucked it up instead of ruining her big day.EDIT: typosEDIT 2 because there was some confusion:My husband is able bodied and white (so is most of my family), but we are indeed a gay couple.",

So that is why the last post was removed(it's back now). I'm not sure what the rules on updates are hereA lot of people wanted an update I wanted to see my roommate in a more positive light. I tend to try to see the best in people but reading the replies and his recent actions have opened my eyes. I never took him too seriously because he's a pretty harmless little guy in my perspective. There is a big difference in how he lashes out at me compared to his gf. He's gotten big tough with me in text form but only mildly upset when I see him in person. I have taken a step back and looked at anything I could have done to provoke him(not excusing his behavior) And while I don't believe I am in the wrong for being hospital and hosting a guest. If a 75 year old man we're staying with us. I would treat him the same as I have treated his gf.I do realize that he is not from the south. I was told by others in school that women outside the south don't enjoy being called \"ma'am.\" however, I've never seen a lady get angry if I did call her ma'am up here. I call women of all ages \"dear\" or \"darling\" and I could see how that could be seen as flirtatious even though it's just part of how I speak. Now that he knows I have seen him in his \"true form\" he doesn't even try to act the way he did before. I sent his gf screenshots of the texts he's sent and told her the things he's said. I'm not sure if she is leaving or staying but I've let her know and told her to let me know if she needs any help. I don't plan on moving any time soon as I enjoy having room for a grill and smoker and a garage. He told me he's looking for new places to live and will potentially go back to his parents. I make enough working at a restaurant to afford the rent alone. I would like more going into savings but I'm not worried financially for the time being.I am flattered and overwhelmed by all the positive replies. Bout a hundred of you told me to thank my mom so I sure will. I grew up working in hospitality with my mom and siblings. My dad is the one that instilled respect into me. He never felt emasculated even when my mom's business ended up making more than he does. They just save their money from their jobs and go on vacation a lot. Thank you for all the kindness and offers for adoption/jobs/relationships/friendships lol. A lot of people wanting gumbo & chicken recipes. Too much to type out but I use curry powder in a lot of things to give it some good flavor(that's how my mom does it). White pepper is essential for that good good fried chicken flavor(original post)I(21m) am from the south. I grew up in New Orleans and Texas. My mom runs a catering business and the majority of clients were either at home in Louisiana or in Texas. I add this to say that I grew up cooking and helping my mom cook for the business. I was frying chicken and catfish when I could reach the stove and making gumbo and buttermilk biscuits at a very young. I'm currently in culinary school right now.I've lived in a rented house on the east coast with my roommate(22m) for a year and a half. He's not a friend or anything. We just linked up because we both needed roommates in the area. He's good to live with and we watch shows and movies together. We hang out and go out for drinks sometimes. I always make friends easy because of being from the south and doing customer service related things since I was a kid. I know how to talk and charm and listen to folk despite being naturally more in the introverted spectrum. My roommate has been seeing his girlfriend(20m) for like 6 months. I've met her before and seen her in passing. Roommate and his gf had a 2 week break from school things. She still lives at her parents so she decided to stay here the whole two weeks.  I was just doing things as I would normally do. It got weird at first when I was about to go mow the lawn and the roommate stopped me and said he wanted to mow(I usually always mow.) A couple of days later I was outside washing my car. I asked both of them if they wanted me to do theirs. She looked like she was going to agree but he looked at her angrily so they declined.I cook pretty frequently at home as well and usually let my roommate have some. So any time I'd make some I would say that they could have some and this would get him pissed. Weeks prior when she was here and we were all talking. She mentioned this specific kind of cheesecake that she really likes. So I made and sent out a group text that everyone could have it. My roommate got upset. I don't see anything as overstepping a boundary as this is how I treat him and all guests. The other day he told me how annoying it was to hear his gf talk about \"how good your roommate can fresh baked bread is.\" I'm not trying to make him look bad or anything. This is simply how i was raised. If I bake two loaves of bread I'm gonna leave it out for the house to eat.EDIT- The cheesecake is just common courtesy type thing to me. When his parents come over i make pound cake because they like it. If a guest is coming you get/make what they like. Nothing odd about picking up their favorite chips or making some tea when guests arrive. Just how I was raisedEDIT- Wow this has blown up. Just want to say we generally have a good roommate relationship. We're not best friends but it's friendly enough. The only change has been when his gf is here. So lol no I am not looking to for new roommates/to be adopted/or to move but thanks. Here is some more things that upset him.I went to the grocery store and asked if anyone needed anythingI was frying chicken and offered the first/best pieces out the oil to themI changed the oil to my own carI used a smoker in the backyard to make brisketI grill and smoke in the backyard and needed a piece of wood cut into a certain way to hold something up. I cut and nailed some wood together in the garage.Feels like I can't even exist while she is hereFINAL EDIT- I tend to see the good and best in people. So I was not seeing him as being very insecure and was trying to look at this in a more positive light. But he just texted me and said that I  greet his gf in too kind of a way and it's annoying that I say \"be safe\" when she leaves the house(I say this to him and everyone when they they tell me they are going somewhere). He sent me a long text detailing it's bad that I look her in the eyes when she is talking to me??? Maybe it is time for a new roommate",

	"body" : "I (40f) have 3 kids. Maggie (14f), Levi (12m) and Charlie (10m). (**NOT THIER REAL NAMES)**Levi and Charlie share a bedroom and Maggie has her own room as the oldest and also only girl.Maggie is a great kid. She does her homework, helps with chores without too much complaint, doesn’t bug her little brothers (too) much. The issue is that she will not stop slamming her bedroom door. When she gets up to use the bathroom at night she slams her bedroom door on her way out and back in. When she gets up in the morning or goes to bed at night she slams it. Pretty much any time she enters or exits her room the door gets slammed. And it’s only her door, none of the other doors in the house. It shakes the walls and frequently wakes up everyone else in the house. Her brothers room shares a wall with hers and our bedroom is directly above theirs.We’ve talked to her about it and asked her very politely to please be more mindful about it because it is disturbing the rest of us but it’s in one ear and out the other. We tried being more forceful about it saying that if she continues to slam her door there will start to be consequences. Still nothing changes. It all came to a head the other night when she got up to use the bathroom and all 4 of us were woken up by the slamming. I have to be up at 5am for work and I’ve had enough of the broken sleep and came downstairs and knocked on her door. She opened it and said WHAT?! with such attitude it took a lot of self control not to start yelling.I told her as calmly as I could that if she slammed that door one more time she was going to come home and find it gone. She proceeded to yell at me to leave her alone and then slammed it 5 times as hard as she could. Well the next day (Friday) she went to school and my husband and I both had the day off so we took the door off the frame and installed a curtain rod with a nice heavy curtain over the door instead. She came home and freaked the fuck out. She said we’re being emotionally abusive and taking away her right to privacy. She sulked all weekend and won’t talk to us now. My mother says I’m the AH because I overreacted but she doesn’t have to deal with the house shaking.I want to add that we completely respect each other’s privacy in our house which is why we hung up a heavy curtain and made sure that we couldn’t see through it or around it. We even put little Velcro pieces on the walls and curtain sides so it stays in place. She still has her physical privacy which she is absolutely entitled to, but can’t slam a piece of fabric. We also have never and still don’t just go into her room unannounced and still knock on the wall to ask permission to enter. We’ve told her we’ll happily put her door back on once she agrees to respect the no slamming rule.So AITA?Edit to add:The curtain is an industrial type that blocks sound and lightThe curtain is only meant to be a temporary measure. As soon as she agrees to stop slamming and be respectful of the shared space we will put it right back on.The door isn’t broken or malfunctioning in any way and there is no draft causing it to swing shut.",

It was mostly family and a few of my close friends were invited I invited Abby and her son because everyone else in our family was invited so I felt bad excluding her.  We had different activities for the kids to do. Abby’s son didn't like any of them. He was upset none of the presents were for him. He didn't want to eat any of the food we had. He then decided to try and push the cake off the table because apparently, he was mad the cake wasn't his. I got super upset at Abby for allowing her son to act that way. She went on to say her son is special. I said her son is only special to her which is understandable. But to everyone else, he's a spoiled brat which shouldn't be overlooked because he was your special miracle baby. Abby called me a bitch and left crying. A few family members have since called me an AH because I've never dealt with a miscarriage so I don't understand how painful it was for Abby to deal with years of that before her son. It's not that I don't realize her son is special to her but it doesn't give the excuse for Abby to allow him to act like a spoiled brat.",

About two years ago my brother, Greg (25M) married Cheryl (34F). Cheryl has a daughter from a previous relationship (Becca, 9F) who has several health conditions, including celiac and a severe dairy allergy that requires her to carry an epi-pen.Last weekend I hosted a dinner at my house for my parents' wedding anniversary. I made a fancy five-course dinner and in addition to my parents, I invited four close family friends, Greg, Cheryl and Becca, and my sister, her boyfriend and their twins (both 8M). Because of Becca's food restrictions, I found a restaurant in town that specializes in gluten-free, dairy-free (as well as other allergen-free) food, and arranged for them to make a full meal for Becca that I could pick up in advance of the party. I have made a variety of speciality meals in the past (for example, keto meals when my friend was following that diet) and I like the challenge, but knowing how serious Becca's restrictions were, I didn't trust myself to make her meal. I have ADHD and get easily distracted, and if I even used the wrong spoon or didn't completely wash some flour off a bowl, it could make her incredibly sick.I thought the \"take out\" solution was fine, but when I served the food, I saw Cheryl looking at Becca's plate with a stony face. For her part, Becca started eating and seemed fine. Cheryl whispered to Greg, and Greg asked if he could talk to me in the kitchen. When we got there he said that it was \"unbelievable\" that I couldn't be bothered to make something for Becca, that they'd been bragging about what a great cook I am to her, and that he knew I'd made keto, vegan, and other complicated kinds of food in the past; now she would feel left out because she didn't get to eat what the rest of the family was eating. He said that it was obvious that I didn't care about making his stepdaughter feel like a part of the family, and that they were leaving. Greg, Cheryl and Becca then left, which put a damper on the rest of the party.I felt like I did my best at the time, but in hindsight, I wonder if I should have tried harder to make Becca feel included since she is a relatively new addition to our family.

I quickly learned that they can’t provide personalized care and after learning from her teachers, I reset my expectations. My wife, however, has a lot of anxiety and worries about our daughter. She hates when she gets even a little upset. She’s in therapy and is working on it.First program, my wife would constantly watch the live feed and call the daycare multiple times a day. We had several talks about it and the school talked to us twice. My wife ended up screaming at one of the teachers and then the director. We were terminated immediately. Second daycare was a little better because my wife began therapy. But my wife was still so nervous and had a complaint every single day. These were not important things, small things like she saw another child took a toy from Alexis and she would cry. The teacher would give the toy back to Alexis but my wife didn’t understand why the other child wasn’t punished for it. This daycare didn’t kick us out but did eventually suggest that this may not be the best program for us. My wife and I decided to pull Alexis out. My wife because of her anxiety, myself because I knew my wife had burned bridges and was becoming “one of those moms”.We chose a smaller home daycare this time as we couldn’t afford another center. The woman who owns it is very nice but also firm. She stands by her boundaries and won’t let my wife break any rules, whereas the centers were definitely more accommodating. My wife would take any inch she got. This time, she doesn’t get that opportunity. I thought all was well as the owner only speaks to my wife for the most part.Then, I get put in a group text saying my wife has been bombarding the owner with texts every day, despite the owner saying she will text her at lunch when things are settled. She said at this point, she will only be responding at specific times of the day and not looking the rest. The owner then added sent several pages of the contract with passages highlighted, reminding us of certain policies my wife had violated.I was pissed. When Alexis went to bed that night, my wife and I talked. I said this was our last option for daycare. The other centers are too expensive and this was the only home daycare in the area that we like. A nanny is not in our budget. My wife made a million excuses, including that it’s not her fault she’s anxious. I said if we are asked to leave this program too, my wife will be the one quitting her job to watch Alexis, not me. This upset my wife. I pointed out I’ve spoken to her kindly about this plenty of times. I encourage her to keep up her therapy. But she can’t keep getting us kicked out of programs.

	"body" : "I (23F) was raised by my older half sister (32F). I never met my dad and our mom OD'd when I was 10 and my sister was 19. My sister's dad was still in her life and was willing to support her, but not me. My sister chose to be my guardian and her father's family went low-contact with her as a result. In order to raise me she gave up a lot; her relationship with her father, college, her 20s, and so much more.A few months ago I got engaged and I told my sister that in addition to being my maid of honor, I also wanted her to be the one to walk me down the aisle. All my life she's had to fulfill so many roles for me -- big sister, mother, father, friend -- that it only felt right that those multiple roles be honored on one of the biggest days of my life. My sister was ecstatic and so was I, but when I brought it up with my fiance he objected.My future in-laws are very traditional and my fiance had always expected that his wedding would be a very traditional white wedding. He said that it was great that my sister was my MOH, but that her having two roles wasn't and that it wasn't appropriate for her to walk me down the aisle since that's usually done by a man. Apparently, his family had assumed that my future father-in-law would be the one to give me away since I don't have any male relatives.I told him that I appreciate his father being willing to fill that role, but that the one who make me the person I am is my sister and so it's right that she be the one to give me away. It turned into an argument that's spread to my in-laws. My MIL called me a few days ago to say that although she understand how important my sister is to me, that it's also my fiance's wedding and I shouldn't be putting my sister before him on his day.I definately heard her on that, but this is still important to me. At this point, my sister has even said that she doesn't mind just being the MOH and that she doesn't want to turn my happy day into something stressful. So now it's just me holding out and being stubborn, but I really don't want to concede on this point. Am I being the AH?EDITI did not expect this to blow up like this and haven't been able to read through all of your verdicts and comments yet, but I wanted to clarify on some of the inquiries which I've seen repeated so far.Are the in-laws contributing to the wedding?Yes. In fact, they're paying for about 75% of it since I'm in still in school and don't have the money to put towards a wedding the scale that fiance wanted.Does your fiance have sisters?No; he has two younger brothers.Did he ask your sister for your hand?He did, actually. She also helped him custom design the engagement ring. She showed me their group text and at one point they spent three weeks trying to decide between five different diamonds. \"Maybe I should just propose with an infinity gauntlet\".  It was very sweet and cute.What about when you have children/Have you talked about children?Because of a medical condition, I am infertile, though neither of us feel a particular strong urge to be parents anyway. But we also know we're still young and that may change, but even if it does it would be very far in the future. I know all to well that things happen, people leave or fall down or die and so even if we got to the point of wanting to adopt it would have to be when I'm financial stable enough that even alone I'd be able to support and care for a child without it being major blow to my or the child's quality of life.Could you walk down the aisle by yourself?That was my sister's suggestions when she said she was fine just being the MOH, but I rejected it. Because of her, I never walked alone on the worst days of my life so I'm definately not going to walk alone on the happiest.Your sister is amazing!She is, as far as I'm concerned, the definition of strength and love and I am collecting all of the kind kind things you all have said to show her because she doesn't realize how amazing she is and it's a gd crime.Please update usI absolutely will. You've all given me a lot to think about, including underlying motivations and larger implications. I'm going to be taking a few days to sit with that and with myself and my feelings, but I promise to make an update about how I've decided to move forward.",

I had a problem with the implication that I shouldn't be allowed to sleep next to my wife, and I also have a bad back and the couch did not look the least bit comfortable (they don't have a guest room).After arguing back and forth for a bit, I decided to leave and book a hotel. I told my wife she didn't have to come with me, she chose to stay and I said I'd come back the next day. I went off to a Marriott about 10m away and got a good night's sleep, trying to not let the whole situation bother me.This morning, I called my wife asking when I should come by. She told me her parents want me to apologize for leaving the way I did. I told her that I'm willing to apologize to keep the peace, but they need to acknowledge that it wasn't appropriate to insist I can't share a bed with my own wife. She said she'd talk to them and call me back.About 10 minutes later, I hear back from her, and she tells me that not only will they not apologize for it, they are now insisting I need to come back and stay on the couch for the rest of our visit, and if I don't agree to this, I'm not welcome back in the house. I'm pretty livid at this point - I told her that there's absolutely no chance that I will do that, and I am no longer willing to offer any sort of apology.My wife's sisters are now bothering me saying this is just the way their parents are, that my wife is very upset, and that I need to just give in and stay on the couch for the rest of the trip before this turns into some sort of family feud. From my perspective, I don't care what they think and I'm willing to treat the rest of this trip as a solo vacation, go sightseeing and meet my wife back at the airport at the end of the week.AITA?UPDATE: Wow, I didn't expect this post to blow up the way it did. Thanks for all the responses and awards! I took the advice of one of the posters here to ask my wife and her sisters to meet me for dinner apart from their parents. It was interesting to say the least.After we sat down, I leaned into them a bit about what had happened. I asked my wife if she knew her dad was going to demand we sleep separately, and she said she was surprised by it as well - she'd expect that if I were still just her boyfriend, but we're married now. I then asked them all if they thought it was OK for their parents to act the way they did. They said it wasn't, but they know their father and it's best to just let things like this go.This led to a somewhat uncomfortable conversation about how controlling he can get, how he angers easily when he doesn't get his way, and that he was already throwing a fit over me \"disrespecting him\" by leaving. The reason they were all trying to get me to come back and apologize was because he would find some way to make them all miserable for the rest of the week if I didn't. I told my wife I was really disappointed that she wouldn't side with her husband when I was clearly in the right, and she went sort of quiet.I then asked if they thought this was even about house rules, because it seemed more like their dad was just trying to show me who was in charge. They agreed.Up to this point I had really done everything I could to not escalate this situation, but I started to get really mad that they were all so afraid of how their dad would react. I decided I needed to push back a bit.I know my wife was mainly here to spend time with her sisters who she rarely gets to see. so I told them all I was going to move to a hotel by the beach about an hour away in San Diego for the rest of the week and I'd book a second room for them if they wanted to all join. They don't get to go on trips much, so I figured they'd be excited to get a free vacation away from their parents. They know that their dad is probably going to freak out when they leave, but I think they realized this situation had gone too far so they decided they would come and deal with the fallout afterwards.So that's where this all stands for now. I'm about to check out of my hotel and hit the road for San Diego. My wife and her sisters are coming down in a separate car after their parents leave for work. I fully expect their dad to throw a conniption fit when he finds out they left without telling him, but I really don't care at this point. I tried to be the bigger person at every turn, but he pushed this all way too far.Thanks again to everyone for all the insight.",

	"body" : "I'm 25M, i have two parents. My birth dad (John) who's 48M and my other dad Dwayne who's 45M. I call my birth dad John, \"Dad\". And I call my other dad Dwayne, \"Pops\".My birth dad John was married to my mom for a few years, then she left my dad and yeah. They ended up divorcing and now she's somewhere in California, idk where or what she's doing. Haven't talked to her in ages.So dad, and pops i'm super close with. They are the best parents any child could ask for. I love both of them and they've always been with me. My dad introduced me to pops when i was a little boy and they had told me they were in a relationship (and i was all for it because i had saw my dad become lonely/sad when he was single) so seeing the fact that my dad loves someone and has a life partner made me super happy.Pops & Dad got married, and we've been living an amazing life. I'm probably more to close to Pops then my own dad haha. Due to the fact that Pops is really cool and he's laid back. I love both of them equally and they love me as well, and i'm blessed to have them as parents.For a few months i've been dating this girl bella who's my age. I thought she's pretty cute and i liked her. So we kicked it and recently she told me \"My parents want to meet your parents and want to come over for dinner\" I said sure. I'll tell my family.So yesterday, Friday night. Bella comes in. Pops greets her and says \"Come on in sweetheart, dinner is ready\". She says \"You must be ____ dad so good to meet you\" and she shakes his hand and she sees Dad come out of the kitchen \"He's holding the mac n cheese tray\" with the mittens and is putting it on the table. Then bella says \"Who's he?\" i said, \"Oh that's my dad\". She said \"I though he's your dad\" she's referring to Pops. I say yeah. That's my pops? And that's my dad? She pulls me to the side and says \"I didn't know your parents are gay? Oh my god? why didn't you tell me?\"I genuinely didn't know why, that'd be an issue or so. Because your dating me, not my parents and all. So it shouldn't matter. But i guess it's a concern for her. Her parents come at the door after they parked the car and bella tells her parents \"let's leave\" and they left. I told my parents i'm sorry and they said \"son don't worry this is nothing new haha\" and then we all sat down and enjoyed dinner and went to sleep.So AITA for not telling?",

	"body" : "I've been seeing my fiance for 4 years now and I came in to the relationship with 2 boys. My boys are now 12 and 9. Once a year me and the boys go to my families vacation home with the entire family and up until this year, my fiance did not attend. But now that we are engaged and merging families, the family asked that he come too (they all get along great with him anyways). I explained to him prior to us coming to our family retreat that during our week stay with the family, my kids do not have a bedtime. We do a lot of night activities, such as night swimming in the pool, karaoke, fires, nightly strolls through the neighborhood, etc etc. So during this week, my kids absolutely do not have a bedtime and this is how it has always been. I made it clear that bedtime was not to be enforced like it was at home because this is vacation and time with family and I'm not making my kids miss out on the nightly activities. I also explained that due to this, some nights they are up until easily 11-midnight. It's once a year, it's no big deal. So he was fully aware and please note that this is the only time I've seen this side of him that I will mention below.We get here the first night and you can tell he is already uncomfortable with the boys staying up past their bedtime. He was stressing out because the boys were still in the pool at 10pm and he felt they should be in bed already. I reminded him at least twice that we were not enforcing a bedtime here and he let it go the first night. The second night 9pm rolls around and the boys were still up and my fiance was dropping comments like \"you're lucky you're even still awake right now, you should be in bed\". Saying it right in front of my mom, who looked mortified that he had such an attitude. I told him to cut the fucking shit, in private. He tells me he thinks it's fucked up and that it's going to be terrible trying to get them back on their schedule (never been an issue in the years prior). I stood firm and told him to knock it off and let it go.But then last night my fiance starts angry sighing every single time he looks at my kids still awake and I finally pulled him aside and told him he was a fucking embarrassment because he keeps saying these comments in front of my family, which leads to awkward silences and judgemental glances my way. I warned him prior to coming here and if he had an issue that he can't control for a week than he needs to leave because he's ruining our trip with his passive aggressive BS surrounding a bedtime. He told me I'm an AH for making him feel like garbage over wanting to keep the kids on a schedule because it's \"best for them\". AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for pulling my daughter from a waterpark trip because her teacher made her stay with a kid she doesn't like?",
	"body" : "My daughter Bryn F9 is going on a trip to a nearby water park with her class next week. She loves water and has been talking about it for months, so I was a bit thrown off when she came home crying a few days ago and told me she didn’t want to go. I asked her why and she wouldn't tell me because she thought I’d think she’s a “bad person.” When I finally coaxed it out of her, she said her teacher “Ms. N” has forced her to be the “buddy” of her classmate “Ben” for the entirety of the trip. She was to ride the bus with Ben to and from the trip, eat lunch with him, and go on all the rides with him instead of spending time with her friends. She then said nobody likes Ben because he whines whenever they have to do work and picks his nose and wipes boogers everywhere.I was horrified, not only because Ms. N had made Bryn do such a thing, but also because she had made her believe she was a bad person for not wanting to. Unfortunately this wasn’t my first experience with Ms. N, as she frequently used my soft-spoken, intelligent older daughter as a “behavior buffer” for the naughty boys until I threatened to report her to the superintendent. It’s clear to me that Ms. N is still too comfortable with enforcing archaic gender roles on her kids and forcing girls to do unpaid emotional labor for the sake of the boys.I immediately sent Ms. N an email condemning her actions. She sent me back an email with a bunch of bs that basically ended with “if Bryn goes on the trip, she has to be Ben’s buddy.” Fine. I informed her Bryn would not be attending then. I immediately booked VIP tickets the same day her class was going so she could still go to the park and see her friends.What happened next I wasn’t expecting. Bryn is quite popular, so I have gotten to know a lot of the moms in her class. When I let them know what Ms. N did, some of them were so horrified that they also pulled their kids out of the trip. In total, eight kids (out of a class of twenty) are either not going, or going with us. Today I got an email from Ms. N saying that because almost half of the class isn’t going, they either have to raise the cost for the other students or not go at all. She practically begged me to let Bryn go and tell all the other parents to let their kids go, promising she wouldn’t make Bryn do anything she didn’t want to do. I told her she should have thought about that before she tried to make my daughter do her job.My husband said I was being a bit petty and that Ms. N clearly feels bad about what she did, and I should let Bryn go as I’ve already gotten my way. He asked me if I really wanted to deprive children of what they’ve been waiting for all year. The thing is, if this wasn’t Ms. N’s first offense I probably would have agreed, but she has a pattern of this type of behavior and hopefully this will put a stop to it. Plus, if she has to explain this to her superiors, I have receipts. Is my husband right? Or am I justified?UPDATE: Bryn WAS the only student assigned a \"buddy.\" The rest of the students were free to do what they wanted.UPDATE: First, thank you for the support everyone!Second, I have taken the issue (including screenshots of the emails) to admin. Several other parents also came forward with similar stories about Ms. N. using students, particularly female students, to do her job. Ms. N. has been placed on temporary leave while they figure out a more permanent solution. Personally, after hearing things from other parents about her, I'd like to see her fired and blacklisted from ever teaching again, but I hope this at least scares her out of treating her students this way.",

My parents seem to be ignoring it since Joanne pays her rent on time and keeps to herself when she's in the house and doesn't cause many problems.I'm a college student on a government grant, and I'm in college Monday to Friday up until 5/6pm, working isn't really an option for me right now, so I don't go out much and I spend all my money on college supplies. Joanne doesn't seem to understand this and is always asking to borrow money and what not. I always say no because it works out that I only have €40 every week to spend on college stuff and travel to college.I got a Christmas bonus on my grant and I ended up deciding to book tickets for a small ish local gig that's next week. I booked two, one for me and one for my best friend because her birthday is the same day and she loves the type of music, it was meant to be a surprise for her. I had told Joanne about this on one of her \"good days\" because I was genuinely excited to finally do something and live the college student lifestyle for a night.The tickets were digital, on an account shared with my parents. Joanne had asked for the login telling them that she wanted to book tickets to something, but she was lying and used it to sell my tickets for drug money. I didn't find out until I had gotten the email to confirm that the tickets were sent to someone else and I was really confused at first. I checked and they were sent to someone I know Joanne knows.I went straight to her when she got home and asked what the fuck she did, and she tried lying but I showed her proof it went to someone she knows and told her I wanted my money back then and there.

	"title" : "AITA for “embarrassing” my cousin and getting us kicked out of a restaurant?",
	"body" : "I F(25) don’t have kids yet. I never really wanted them growing up but I figure I’ll eventually have kids in the future once I get my life together. My cousin Sarah (29) has two bad behaved kids from a previous relationship and a newborn baby with her boyfriend MJ (40).Last night my mother, sister, Sarah and I went to a sushi restaurant - and this was my first time having sushi. After we ordered, I had a hard time using the chopsticks. My cousin started obnoxiously laughing.The waiter came over and asked me if I wanted “training wheels” which is a little plastic item that attaches to the chopsticks and helps you hold them in place. My cousin laughed and said “sorry about her, she constantly embarrasses herself and us.”I just gave her the side eye and put the training wheels on. When it was time to order desserts, her boyfriend MJ finally joined us - claiming that he was “busy.” She went on to tell him how “stupid” and “slow” I was for not knowing how to use chopsticks and how the waiters and everyone around now know that I’m an embarrassment. My mom asked her what her problem was and she goes on a rant about how I’m so embarrassing and it’s no wonder I’m “jealous of her being a mother” and “no one wants to have kids with me.”I finally had enough. I said “I don’t have kids because I don’t want them to come out like your rude pieces of shit” and “you’re calling me an embarrassment? Didn’t MJ just have a baby on you with his wife? Your baby literally has a sibling a week apart from her. You probably learned how to use chopsticks by eating his wife’s leftovers.”I guess when she was attacking me it was fine because everyone turned on me. It got so loud that management had to get involved. Sarah was screaming and crying, MJ was yelling at me, and my mom and sister were berating me for being “mean.”Management brought the bill and told us to please pay it and leave. My mom paid the entire bill but my sister said I’m an AH for embarrassing Sarah and getting us kicked out - and how she’s probably going through postpartum depression.Now…idk if I went too far seeing as she’s probably going through some post baby stress. AITA?UPDATE:Thank you all for the overwhelming responses! I’ve been wanting to put Sarah in her place for a while now - and I’m glad I did! However, Sarah’s Mom got involved and is mad at me.Apparently, MJ told Sarah that him and his wife were separating. Sarah found out that he lied because she was secretly stalking his wife’s Facebook page - and got the shock of her life when wifey posted a newborn baby and MJ was there for the birth.Sarah did the math and realized that he got both of them pregnant the week of his birthday. She confronted him and he confirmed it. He also said that she’ll have to get over it or he’ll leave. So, she stayed and is now constantly in shambles. Not my problem.Now onto the problem. She kept the wife’s baby a secret and only told her mom, who told my mom, who told my sister and I. So, they said that they were pissed because I wasn’t supposed to repeat it.BUT I DIDN’T KNOW IT WAS CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. After like a week, that’s all everyone talked about.Sarah’s mom (my aunt) reached out to me this morning and she said that Sarah’s problem with me is that I always said I don’t like kids and only a “horrible person” won’t like kids - and that I was mean to her about her kids 2 months ago.2 months ago she wanted to go to a party with MJ and asked me to watch her kids. ALL THREE OF THEM. FOR FREE. I told her no because they’re untrained, I don’t feel comfortable watching a newborn - and she’ll have to pay me to put up with the other two.So, I guess that’s why she’s still holding grudges.Regardless, Sarah’s mom said she was having a really hard time after finding out about the “outside” baby (who technically is the inside baby as Sarah’s baby is the outside baby but whatever) and she wants me to apologize for putting her business out there for everyone.She got my mom and sister involved so I just called Sarah and apologized. She just said “I don’t care what you have to say” and hung up.Regardless. I held up my end of the bargain. Hopefully this gets blown over soon because ya girl is TIRED.",

	"body" : "WIBTA for not attending my twin brothers surprise birthday dinner when I am only invited as a guestWould I be the asshole for not attending a surprise birthday dinner for my twin brotherSo I’m a twin, my brother and I hang out all the time and we are super close. In a few days its our (25m) birthday. We share the same friend group and we’re all really close and have been since school. He has a close group of girl friends (about 5 of them) who I have also known for many years, I would class them as being closer with him in recent years but we are all still good friends and socialise often together.Now, I have been added to a group chat labeled “my brothers name surprise dinner!” It is a surprise birthday dinner for my twin brother organised by one of the girls in that group and they have invited me as a guest. One of them also said in the group that it would “be nice to see me as well” so I just feel like an afterthought. I wouldn’t really have minded if the girls wanted to organise a surprise birthday evening exclusively for my brother and themselves but they have also invited my partner and some of my brother and I’s closest friends.This feels inconsiderate and quite upsetting as I can’t understand why I would be invited to my literal twin brothers surprise birthday dinner with me only invited as a guest as it is also my birthday involving all of our friends. My girlfriend also found this action to be extremely rude and wondered why this girl didn’t just reach out to her and then they could have organised a surprise involving both of us instead or have just involved both my brother and I and left the surprise element out of it.In the chat it is clearly stated that we are all to arrive at one time while my brother is due to arrive 20 minutes later. The thought of attending makes me feel weird because it’s just a celebration for “his” birthday when him and I are literally born on the same day. This isn’t new information to the organiser. Also, every year my brother and I do something together because we want to and because we have the same friends, last year our friends and my girlfriend set up a massive dinner for our birthday to which everyone was invited, including the girl group.So now I’m at a crossroads. I don’t know whether or not to attend. On one hand, if I don’t go I will feel left out because our mutual friends are going. But on the other hand if I do go, I will feel like I am letting myself be disrespected and I will likely feel uncomfortable as it feels like only my brother is being celebrated.So, WIBTA if I took a stand and didn’t go?EDIT: my girlfriend has just checked the chat and the organiser has booked the dinner for 10 people and a set menu. There are currently 11 attending excluding my girlfriend and I. If we went, this would make it way over capacity. Now we really aren’t sure if we should go because what if we turn up and there is no room? This makes it slightly more awkward as we may not be able to just pull up a chair and join? The dinner is tomorrow also.Thanks for all the kind messages as well, I will definitely give an update after everything plays out(Edit: I have posted an update to my profile as my character count was too long)UPDATE",

I was a SAHM for a long time and once they started to spread their wings instead of going to work my husband and I decided I would be a home maker and be active in the community. That’s what I have been up to and I try to make the community a better place.Now my oldest son 22 married and I was really excited until I met her. In general she is a very business focus person that is very blunt. I actively dislike her but I try to be polite for my sons sake.A few examples of why I don’t like her, her wedding gift I handed over saying it was from me and my husband. She responded back with just your husband since I know it wasn’t your money that paid for it. Saying I am volunteering well that’s not a real job since it doesn’t make money. It’s passive aggressive and yes I have talked to my son about it and even once’s with her to try to clear the air.We had a get together last night and i made a homemade meal. When I was playing everything she came up and made the comment other no wonder I could make a home cooked meal I don’t do anything else with my day.I lost it and told her that she needs to respect me or ge the fuck out of my house. She was shocked and then started to cry when I did kick her out. My son is pissed and we had a huge argument and he called me a huge asshole. I need an outside opinion.",

	"body" : "My husband's sister (38) lives with us and our kids. I'm well beyond fed up with her being here because of food issues. That's the only reason.So, basically, every single time I make food his sister will come in and \"doctor up\" the food I'm making to her liking. Like I made steak and shrimp the other day (like Applebee's) and she waited until I left the room to put a full stick of butter in my shrimp- that was already done- and when I came back in, she goes \"I'm pretty sure that's the taste you were looking for\" and completely ruined it. It was trash. Or whenever I make spaghetti she will start dumping sugar in to the sauce, to a point of sweet spaghetti that me and my kids outright refuse to touch because it's nasty. Every single time that she can get away with it, she's doing something to the food.Anyways, my husband has started doing the same thing. I went to make home made Mac last night and cheese burgers. I went to the basement to the chest freezer to grab the veggies I needed and when I came back upstairs, my husband was putting canned chicken in to the Mac n Cheese (he knows the kids absolutely hate the taste of that) and his sister has pushing blocks of blue cheese in to the partially cooked burgers. I asked what the fuck they thought they were doing (because I've told them SO MANY TIMES to stop fucking with the food) and neither of them had any good excuse, other than \"we were just helping\". I flipped out and told them to get the fuck out of my kitchen. Both of them told me I was overreacting, etc etc.The thing is, I've openly asked my SIL to cook several times and she won't. But she won't stop fucking with the food I'm making. My husband cooks often and I don't care if he screws with food he makes but it royally pisses me off when my cooking is messed with and he knows that. AITA?",

	"body" : "A little bit of context for you all, I ended up falling pregnant with my 10 year old daughter during a drunken hook-up with a friend in my mid 20s. Not the most glamourous or flattering truth but it's the truth all the same. When we found out we decided to keep the child and co-parent while remaining friends. We were never a couple and we didn't want to be one either.Four years ago he began to date his longterm girlfriend and they moved in together last year. She fell pregnant and i've been supportive to them both as much as I could be without crossing any lines; i've encouraged my daughter to help out whenever she's staying with them during the pregnancy and to behave, i've also made it clear that I want the children to have a close relationship despite having different Mothers, i've even said that if they were comfortable with it on nights I have my daughter if they ever want time alone i'll babysit once they have the baby so my daughter can spend time with her sibling.All in all, I thought everything was great and I was excited for my daughter to have a sibling as she's always wanted one but I had no interest in having another child. Three days ago my friend and his girlfriend had a daughter, they asked me to bring my daughter to the hospital to meet her little sister yesterday alongside others of the family. So I did exactly that but when they introduced us to the baby I was shocked. They'd named used my daughters name. She didn't seem to have any issue with this when she introduced the baby bold as brass. My friend seemed uncomfortable and wouldn't look at me directly. I asked them what they were playing at, at which point my friends father said he'd take my daughter down to the cafeteria to get something to eat and left with her.My friend told me to calm down and not overreact while his girlfriend told me she didn't see the issue and it was a pretty name. I asked them if they'd named the baby for my daughter trying to understand the logic here but his girlfriend said that no it was just a pretty name she liked. I then asked if they planned to use a nickname or a middle name when addressing to her on a daily basis and her response was that she didn't see a need for that.I told them they were being ridiculous and that they couldn't do this, I then told his girlfriend that I found this frankly creepy and told my friend he was being spineless if he was happy to go along with this. He tried to claim our daughter could use a nickname or something but I shut that down immediately asking why it was more reasonable for a girl who has used that name for a decade to shame her name compared to a baby who had no concept of what a name was yet.His girlfriend told me I was being a bitch talking to her like that after she just gave birth and asked the nurses to remove me saying I was being disruptive.Maybe my temper is running a little too hot though and I was too harsh on her when she just gave birth. It's just so fucking weird.Edit: I'd also like to state, I know that what they want to name their child is their choice, they could have called her Dinosaur for all I care but this is one name that should be off limits or adjusted, they even have the same surname as they have the same father...Something about it just felt malicious and deliberate as if she's trying to replace my daughter and for them both to spring it on us like that at the first meeting? no that was weird.",

	"title" : "AITA for denying an older woman shelter from a storm?",
	"body" : "I (23F) am an avid hiker in Australia. Last week I encountered a middle aged woman, around 50 years old as I was coming off a trail. She was walking in my direction as I came out of the bush. It was strange to see her, the sun was almost down and the weather was starting to turn. also, this was an intermediate collection of trails at best, difficult even for me at worst. and she didn't look super athletic. Point is, my 'weird' radar was going off already.She walked up to me and stopped, standing too close for my comfort, gestured toward the clearing where my car was parked, and asked whether it was my car. No greeting or anything. When I looked over something made me uncomfortable- there were no cars other than mine in sight. The trail I was on isn't crazy far from civilization but it's not a walk away- one of those highway rest stops that's there for the trail and a few parking spots. no way she could have got there without driving.I let her know that, yes, it was my car, to which she responded something like \"Perfect, there's a storm coming, I can't be caught in it and I need to get home\". She was very matter of fact. It seemed like she had already decided what would happen. without waiting for my response, she started striding for my car. I am glad I always lock my doors because she would have hopped right in the passenger seat had the door opened.As she was walking over to it, I went after her trying to explain that I wasn't sure it was a good idea for her to hitch a ride- asking why she was out here in the first place. I was talking to a brick wall until she realised the car was locked, at which point she turned around with this look of anger and frustration on her face. She starts ranting- the same stuff as before \"I NEED to get home\" \"A STORM is coming\" \"I CANNOT be caught in it\" \"Why don't you get it?!\". I was very confused at this point, and a little scared, as this woman was now a barrier between me and my vehicle. I told her something like 'I'm sorry but I don't feel comfortable with having a stranger in my car'.She stared me down for a few seconds, I guess trying to gauge her chances at asking again. And just like that, the anger drops from her face and she’s silent. I was really uncomfortable. I asked if I could call someone, if there was another way to help. she starts walking- towards me (scary), but then right past me. I'm still asking her questions, then just saying things like \"hello\" and \"excuse me\". no response. She walked to the other end of the rest stop and maintained eye contact with me as she sat down on a log, then just stared at nothing.I didn’t follow her. I got into my car really shaken up and drove away. As soon as I was back in cell range I called fire and rescue, they said they would send someone out. I was scared for my safety in the moment, but she was just some woman alone in the middle of nowhere. Am I the asshole for refusing this strange woman a ride/shelter in my car?",

We’ve had a few rough patches, but what’s important to note is that while he earns more than me and is considered the main provider, I have a substantial trust fund that ensures we’re financially stable. I work part-time as a teacher while attending university, earning less than him, and most of my income goes towards tuition. Our household income exceeds $200k annually, while the average in our area is below $50k.One ongoing issue we have is my husband’s frugality. He likes to control my spending and have the final say on how he uses his earnings. It’s worth mentioning that I’ve never used any of his income and have no intention to do so.However, the main point of contention between us is his frequent visits to food banks. Despite having more than enough food at home, he insists on going to food banks to save money. He intentionally looks disheveled and uses our beat-up car to blend in, even though he’s never experienced food scarcity. I’ve explained to him the need for food donations in our community, even showing him social media posts from local food banks, but he remains indifferent. I suggested he volunteer or donate to gain firsthand experience, but he refuses. The unfortunate part is that since we’re never short on food, most of what he brings home ends up getting thrown away.Today, I discovered our fridge filled with fresh produce and meat that clearly didn’t come from our regular grocery store. When I confronted him, he admitted to going to a food bank after seeing a Facebook post about a donation of fresh food. People on social media were already asking if any was left, and there wasn’t. I showed him these comments, but he brushed them off, claiming people should have gone earlier. Exhausted by the situation, I packed a bag and went to stay with my brother for the weekend, asking for space to think things over.My husband accuses me of overreacting, being vindictive, and threatens to go back to the food banks regardless of my feelings. His family is also messaging me, calling me an asshole and urging me to stop interfering with his choices. I turned off my phone, but now they’re bombarding my brother with messages. Thankfully, he supports my decision and ignores them.All I want is to enjoy the rest of my week without being angry at my husband. Yes, I could let this go and not scold him, but the food he takes could have gone to people who truly need it. I’m not leaving my husband, but I need a few days away to gain some clarity.

My parents have made sure that they have accessed every resource available for her to make sure she has as good a life as she can.I was we were visiting her this last weekend when they brought it up again.

Minus sentimental stuff for the rest of my family obviously.I thought that was fair since it's not like they are rich and their estate will mostly consist of their house and the insurance policies they took out when they realized the long term costs of care for my sister.They said that I'm trying to shirk my responsibility to my sister and that I'm greedy for trying to get everything.I had one last suggestion and they really hated it.  I said that they were welcome to cut me completely out of their will.  But that had to include guardianship of my sister.  They could leave everything to her and my brothers but that meant I would be completely free of responsibility for her care.My dad got really angry and my mom was crying when I left.My brothers both called me to say I was being an asshole springing this on my parents. And that I was being greedy trying to keep them and their families from getting anything when our parents pass away.

We had it all planned out for years now and were excited beyond words.Enter our adult daughter Jane. Jane and her husband got wind of our plans and promptly invited themselves and their two children (9F, 5M) along. I originally put my foot down and told them this trip was just for us which upset her some. But my wife has a hard time saying no to Jane, as she is the youngest of our children and our only daughter, and she didn't want to hurt her feelings, so she reluctantly agreed to let them join.I wasn't thrilled about it at the time, but I wanted to make my family happy, and I knew my wife was also okay with the idea of a \"family\" trip even if she was heartbroken we wouldn't get our romantic trip. We went along with it. The place we were originally going was not child friendly so we changed course and decided on an all inclusive family friendly resort. We paid for the resort and our grandchildren's plane tickets. Jane and her husband only had to pay for their own airfare.Here's where things get complicated. As the vacation got closer, I started having a change of heart. I realized that our 40th anniversary was a once-in-a-lifetime milestone, and I wanted to honor it in a way that was true to our original plans. My wife and I might not be able to afford a trip like this again for quite some time and it's something we always wanted to do.So, without consulting anyone, I switched our tickets last minute to go to the romantic destination that my wife and I had originally planned for. I did not tell Jane or her husband. I didn't even tell my wife until the day before our flight left, which was a day before Jane's flight left for their vacation.It wasn't an easy decision and I feel guilty about it. But I wanted our 40th anniversary to be the special, intimate celebration we had always hoped for.We called Jane after we landed to tell her and she was extremely upset to say the least. She seemed of the idea that we were going to look after our grandkids so she and her husband could have alone time and now that I abandoned her they would have to do it all themselves. I hung up on them when my son in law started shouting and my wife and I enjoyed the rest of our trip.They came back the same day we did but have not answered any of our texts and Jane seems to be ignoring me. My wife told me she vastly preferred our trip to the family trip we would have taken but she still doesn't like how Jane is mad at us and wants me to apologize. I'm not sure I want to after learning Jane and her husband were using us for free babysitting and a free trip but I feel like I should just to keep the peace.Am I the asshole for changing our trip destination last minute and leaving Jane and her family to fend for themselves?",

My in-laws invited me and Nate for dinner last Friday. I was very busy back then and haven't eaten since about 6-7am and also didn't have a chance to have a snack before heading to the restaurant so I was starving (I usually have something to eat before seeing my MIL to avoid her comments). Due to this I have ordered a large steak at the restaurant which was meant for 2 people, it also came with prawns, bacon and 2 sides. Please note it was not the most expensive item on the menu as some of my in laws had significantly pricier dishes and we were all splitting the bill anyway.My MIL started making comments how I shouldn't be ordering what I can't eat since even her husband wouldn't be able to finish the dish, let alone someone my size. I smiled and said I haven't eaten since early morning and am starving, if I don't finish the steak I will take the leftovers home.I have easily finished the steak and was waiting for my dessert, when my MIL flipped. She said I am attention seeking and was putting on a show, she also said I have made my FIL and BIL feel uneasy and that a woman shouldn't eat that much, it is unhealthy and something is wrong with me. She has then demanded me and Nate to cover the entire bill as she wasn't planning on \"such a big expenditure\". I said we are absolutely not covering the entire bill since it was meant to be split equally and reminded her of the dishes she ordered, that were significantly more expensive compared to my steak (including her starter). As a result I was called an asshole who has ruined a family dinner.Nate is on my side but most of my in-laws are making very passive aggressive posts on social media about it and keep sending me different articles of \"what might cause excessive eating\".",

	"body" : "AITA For Leaving a Vacation I Planned for my GF After Her Friends Came Along? : AmItheAsshole (reddit.com) From the bottom of my heart, thank you to everyone who sent me kind words and encouraging private messages.I decided that I wanted to end this entire relationship. I packed my important belongings (Ex. Passport, clothes) and arranged with my best friend to crash at his apartment until I can find my own. Usually when small issues happen in a relationship, it ties into a bigger issue of that relationship. The main reason why I decided to break up is because I realized that her friends will always be closer to her than me. Sarah has favored her friends over me and blown off some of our plans for her friends more than once. I was lying to myself for years because I didn’t want to face reality yet. I had hoped she would change, but this trip really opened my eyes that I will always be in 3rd place to her.I expressed my feelings multiple times, and Sarah promised she would change, and she didn’t.Sarah came home late yesterday. I said I have a lot to get off my chest and I want to get through my notes before she talks or tries to interrupt me. The first question I asked Sarah was “How she thought the trip went”. She said we all had fun and it was memorable. I shouldn’t have to feel like the 3rd wheel in my own relationship, especially on a trip that I planned.My next question was “Why did you invite your friends in the first place? You knew this was an anniversary trip for US”. She talked about the trip with her friends since the beginning, and they never been to CO. She thought it would be a good idea to allow them to come just so they can have fun in CO with us. I followed up with my lack of knowledge of her friends coming along until days before. It’s one thing if they came and did their OWN activities. But it’s another thing that every activity became a group activity. I signed up for a monogamous, not poly relationship.My last question was “Did you know that I was going to propose to you?”. Sarah said she didn’t know at all. The thought never occurred to Sarah that I was going to ask. She claimed that she wouldn’t have invited her friends to come along if she knew, but I responded that “it would ruin the surprise if I told you”.Sarah begged me to stay with her and believes we can work everything out. She didn’t want me to throw 5 years away after this one bad trip. I listened to her promises to change for years regarding her friends, but nothing happened. I ultimately left Sarah with this: it’s clear that there isn’t enough room in your heart for your BF and your friends. As much as I love Sarah, I can’t stay in a relationship where I’m not respected enough. I left Sarah in the house by herself and I drove off to my friend’s place.I’ll figure out how to get my name off the lease and I’ll plan to get the rest of my belongings. As for the ring, I will return it this weekend.",

She once made fun of the fact that I get most of my groceries from the local big box super center and not somewhere with more \"high quality product\").But I love John and it mattered a lot to him, so I agreed.Onto the issue: on the final night of my bachelorette party, we decided to have one \"big\" meal that was really pricey and fancy that we all saved up for. Sarah said she had to take an emergency work meeting and for us to go ahead first (the restaurant was walkable from our hotel).Guys, when Sarah showed up, I was FLOORED. She came in a white sparkly sequin number with a tulle skirt and a tiara. When we were planning the trip, my MOH made it abundantly clear that everyone was supposed to wear pink so we could get a really cute photo together at the restaurant.I'm not even kidding, her outfit was so bridal looking the waitress actually asked if we were having a joint bachelorette party. I was so upset, that when it came time to take photos I absolutely refused to have Sarah in them.She said it wasn't her fault because she \"didn't get the memo\", but I told her it was common sense to not wear a bridal looking dress to a bachelorette party if you're not the bride!Plus, she was in the group chat and even made comments about another girl's outfit when we were talking about what we wanted to wear, so I know she knew!All of my friends were on my side and they made sure she didn't end up in the photos. When we got home, she pitched a fit to my brother saying that we bullied her at my party and deliberately left her out. She was also pissed because a lot of family and friends noticed she wasn't in the photos and I wasn't afraid to tell them exactly why.My brother's really upset though because she's been crying and whining about it nonstop since. Apparently they're both so mad that they're going to skip father's day brunch, so the whole thing is blowing up even more.I'm starting to feel bad because my mom told me that my brother and Sarah were fighting a lot now, so I'm not sure if I'm being the AH here.

She made absolutely no effort to sound kind when she, in an extremely rude and annoyed tone, told me to stop packing my son such “disgusting and inappropriate” lunches. I felt absolutely appalled when she said this, as me and the teacher have, up until now, always maintained a very friendly relationship. She added that the lunches I’m packing my son are “very distracting for the other students and have an unpleasant odor.” I told her that I understand her concerns, as the lunches I pack are definitely not the healthiest, but the lunches are according to my son’s preferences.The usual lunch that I send him to school with is small celery sticks with blue cheese and goat cheese, kimchi and spam (we are Korean and he absolutely adores this dish), and spicy Doritos marinated in Sriracha (I know, I know, but he deserves a snack, and I don’t put that many chips in the baggy.)I ended the call by saying that I very much appreciated her worries, but that at the end of the day, I am not going to drastically change my sons’ lunches all of a sudden, and that it’s not my fault if other students are “distracted” by his meal. It is very important to me what my son enjoys, and I want him to like my lunches.The teacher sent an Email to me an hour ago saying that my response was “unacceptable” and that his lunches are “just too inappropriate to be sent to school any longer.” I haven’t responded yet and don’t want to. I want to maintain a healthy relationship with my son’s teachers. I am confused as to what to do. AITA?",

It was me, and two boys (7 and 10) large cheese pizza and breadsticks. I have always been under the impression that the babysitter is allowed to have a reasonable amount of dinner if they're expected to serve dinner. I've babysat a few times in the past and have never encountered this.When the parents came home to relieve me they asked how tonight went. I said fine, and said that the pizza place was really good as I had never ordered from there before. Mom looked at me puzzled, and asked why I ate the kids dinner. I said I just had two pieces of pizza and a breadstick. I feel as if this was not an inappropriate amount to eat. However, the parents disagreed. Dad said that they didn't expect to have to feed me dinner as well, and told me not to eat their family's food.Overall, I am very uncomfortable and confused by this experience. Both boys were fed, and did not complain about being hungry for the rest of the night. I personally have always assumed, perhaps wrongly, that if I am expected to serve dinner as a sitter than I am welcome to have a serving. Is this something anyone else has experienced? AITA?",

Like, if we're having dinner out and I order else, he'd instantly get upset and accuse me of treating him as less than when I just have different taste in foods.I'd just eat what he eats to keep the peace (I eat out alone as alternative) but since he clearly doesn't trust me, he'd randomly touch my plate to see if I'm having the same dish. This caused huge arguments between us and I told him to stop doing it and he said he would.We went out to eat nights ago, and I ordered the same dish he ordered. When the food arrived, he looked somewhat uncomfortable. I asked what was wrong and he refused to say, and before I could even grab the fork he extended his arm and his hand touched the food on my plate. He moved quickly and started excussing what he did saying he \"just wanted to make sure...\" but I lost it on him, I felt so grossed out and there was no way I could eat the food after he touched it. He tried to get me to drop it saying i shouldn't be grossed out by his hand, and that I overreacted etc... but I grabbed his plate and told him that I was taking it as my donner. He at first asked meto be \"rational\" and give the plate back but I refused. An argument ensued and we had a fight. He then ended up leaving started spam texting me accusing me of being bitter, pathetic and childish, and robbing his dinner. He went to stay with his friend who picked him up and his friend sided with him saying I was in the wrong. Even went as far as to say that I was abusing my fiance and financially controlling him when I pointed out that I was the one who paid for the food.The problem is magnified now with him wanting an apology and me refusing to give him one. My parents think I should have more patience and that this is just typical \"love spats\" between us but I'm not sure.Was I the ah with how I handled this?EDIT I want to point out that this is not the case when we ate at home, he has no issue with me eating different food.

The family respects it and she’s pretty good about advocating for herself should someone call her Lexi, Alex, etc. She also hates when people get her name wrong and just wants to be called Alexandra.She took Spanish in middle school. The teacher wanted to call all students by the Spanish version of their name (provided there was one). So, she tried to call Alexandra, Alejandra. Alexandra corrected her and the teacher respected it. She had the same teacher all 3 years of middle school, so it wasn’t an issue.Now, she’s in high school and is still taking Spanish. Once again, the new teacher announced if a student had a Spanish version of their name, she’d call them that. So, she called Alexandra, Alejandra. Alexandra corrected her but the teacher ignored her. My daughter came home upset after the second week. I am not the type of mom to write emails, but I felt I had to in this case.If matters, this teacher is not Hispanic herself, so this isn’t a pronunciation issue. Her argument is if these kids ever went to a Spanish speaking country, they’d be called by that name. I found this excuse a little weak as the middle school Spanish teacher actually was Hispanic who had come here from a Spanish speaking country and she respected Alexandra’s wishes.The teacher tried to dig her heels in, but I said if it wasn’t that big a deal in her eyes that she calls her Alejandra, why is it such a big deal to just call her Alexandra? Eventually, she gave in. Alexandra confirmed that her teacher is calling her by her proper name.My husband feels I blew this out of proportion and Alexandra could’ve sucked it up for a year (the school has 3 different Spanish teachers, so odds are she could get another one her sophomore year).AITA?",

This is not a kind of situation where I'm constantly agitated at her for incompetence or anything like that. I would be more than happy to microwave a burrito. I would be more than happy to whip up a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.But I can't. My wife has, every single night of our marriage, done the same thing: she'll make me a tiny dinner. I'm talking like a Chinese chicken salad with 30 grams of chicken and ten leaves of lettuce arranged fashionably with dressing. When I finish eating, I'm still hungry because for a 230 pound man who works a physical labor job, it's not enough food.At first, I tried to openly communicate with her, but she always took it horribly. She would adopt a thousand-yard stare, and then begin talking about how incompetent she is and how she can't even make her husband a proper dinner. I'd try to calm her down with \"Oh honey that's not the case! I just eat too much\" or \"Don't worry about it. I can make a bit more.\" I'd try to be overwhelmingly positive. It never helped. She would always just get incredibly disappointed in herself, cry, and/or take it out on me.Then she would make the same exact amount the following day.After the communication route failed, I tried to eat her dinners as-is. It became hard to sleep at night due to hunger and I lost seven pounds in the first month.Eventually I figured out my own system. On my way home from work, I started swinging by a fast food restaurant and getting myself a burger. I would basically pregame her meals with some more calories. I figured it was win-win, as what she doesn't know can't hurt her, and I could have my fill of food. I would eat on my way home, walk in the door, pick at the salad or quinoa or homemade Mac and Cheese she made, compliment her for her delicious cooking, and later dispose of the wrappers discretely.Two days ago I was on my way home and in line at a drive-through. My MIL was coming out of the restaurant. She ran over and greeted me. I asked her in a humorous way not to tell her daughter where she saw me because she'd take it badly, and she agreed, but then she narced on me anyway.

	"body" : "My husband (58 M) and I (56 F) recently met my son’s (24 M) girlfriend for the first time. He’s been crazy about her. Apparently they’ve been dating for a year before he decided to have her meet us officially.What he’s told us about her all seems great: she just got her degree, was enjoying her job, family-oriented, etc., I’m honestly just glad he’s happy with her. My husband and I don’t think he’s ever been this into someone before, so I feel pretty bad about what I did.Last weekend, he brought her over for dinner. By now we’d been anticipating meeting her with how much our son has been gushing about her. How perfect she is, that she’s ‘the one’, in his words.They ring the doorbell. We open the door. She looks exactly like her pictures, which is a great start. My son is grinning ear to ear - another great start. We invite them in. She accepts my hug and a firm handshake from my husband, and then she opens her mouth:“I’m the one your son puts his penis in.”To be frank, I was appalled. I expected my husband to laugh (both he and my son are jokesters, and as annoying as it can be I love it) but THIS was just too much for me. Maybe I’m reserved, but of all things she could have shared about my son she told us THAT. One look at my face and my husband knew how much I disapproved.Maybe I let my expectations get too high, and it’s unfair to have them, but I reiterate: of all things to say to her boyfriend’s parents - whom she’d never met - she chose THAT? My son was amused at first but when he noticed my reaction his face dropped.I felt like he’d sold me the full package, everything he’d always been looking for in a girlfriend. I was too disturbed by the visual it put in my head, and it translated into anger. I told her to get out, and I wanted to say more about how gross it made me feel but I fortunately left it at that. My son didn’t want to go, insisting I give her another chance, but I was too fed up and uncomfortable by this point. Even my husband, who’s enjoyed his fair share of raunchy jokes, wouldn’t let up.They left and I immediately felt guilty. This was something my son had really looked forward to and I feel like I took that away over a dumb joke. I tried calling to apologize but he hasn’t responded. My husband thinks she’s the one who should apologize. I’m considering giving her another chance, but before I do, was I the AH?EDIT: I should clear some things up:My husband had no part in my reaction, I did the kicking out, not him. I don’t want him taking the fall for this. He said she should apologize, but I’m not expecting an apology. Sorry for the confusion.My son lives in a nearby state, it can take about an hour to get back to where we live. He also hasn’t dated anyone seriously for a while, maybe a couple of years. He told us before that he wouldn’t bring anyone home unless he’s sure he wants a future with her. We’ve been asking to meet her ever since he told us about her, but he wanted to be ready.The comment about her looking like her picture shows my age, sorry for that! He’s only shown us her photos she’s sent him as he apparently didn’t have any of them together (he hates taking pictures and apparently she’s always teasing him about it). I don’t think he’d ever lie about who she is, but it’s just a parental concern I’ve subconsciously had. I felt the same way about my daughter’s (then) boyfriend when we first met him. I don’t have any criteria that either of my kids’ spouses need to meet, I just hope my kids are happy with them.What I meant by her being ‘the full package’ was indicative of what he’s told us about her. As his parents we have a good idea of what he looks for in a partner and she checked off everything based on what we’d been told. And on top of everything (aside from what she said) her appearance was how she presented it to be. Again, we aren’t strict about appearances, it’s just a relief to have met someone for the first time and they look like what you’d expected. My husband said that I was worried about ‘second-hand catfishing’ if that’s even a thing lol. I guess it shows how anxious I was about this.Also thank you for your comments and rewards! I’ve had a fee people reach out to me personally, too, thank you for that. Regardless of where you stand, I appreciate it. I personally think everyone needs some room for improvement here but I’ve done my part to make amends and I’m waiting on my son to call me! I’ll be sure to give an update about how it goes.UPDATE: Thanks for reaching out everyone. My son got in touch with me. His girlfriend agreed to try again. We all met at a restaurant my son and his girlfriend chose. The first thing she said was an apology for what she said. I apologized for my reaction. We hugged. It was nice. She then explained how my son had convinced her a joke like that would land well, and that she wouldn’t have said it if she didn’t think we’d like it. According to my son, she was reluctant to open with any jokes at all, but they came up with that one together on the way over. You guys were right!She’s a really sweet girl. She’s actually very mature, too. I see why my son likes her so much. My husband and I really like her, we told our son to bring her when he visits. We look forward to seeing them again. Overall, I’m glad we could start over. On the right foot this time. Thanks, everyone for your input.",

Although it was a garden party we were in and out of my home and I have 4 cats. My cats do not like dogs and neither do I.Anyway my friend showed up with her dog, I told her that her dog was not welcome in my home or garden. And asked her to please take her dog home or elsewhere.I thought my friend left. I went inside to sort some things out. I went into my garden about 15 minutes later and my friend was standing there in my garden talking to our friends. She doesn’t live that close so I was confused.I went to ask her how she got back so quickly, she told me she just popped in and was going since her dog isn’t welcome. I asked her where her dog is and she shrugged her shoulders and said he was around.I went looking and found him at the bottom of the garden eating my crops and making a mess. I was angry and told my friend to get her dog off my property.A few hours later she called me asking me what her dog ate, I had no clue. My gardener plants and attends everything, I told her I didn’t know, but told her he’d made a huge mess, dug things up and clearly eaten things.She shouted at me that her dog is sick and that I need to find out what the dog ate. I told her I had no idea, but I’d text my gardener to ask, but it was really her problem.I did send the text, but my gardener didn’t answer. My friend called again wanting to know what her dog ate, but I told her I still didn’t know. She told me I obviously don’t care if her dog dies and called me an AH.I still don’t know what her dog ate, but apparently he is very sick and might die. I feel bad, but I told her not to bring her dog on my property so I don’t feel responsible like she says I am.AITA?ETA - After being unable to reach my gardener I took pictures of everything the dog dug up, which was a lot and sent them to my friend, but I have no idea what it ate and what it just dug up and for all I know what it ate isn’t even pictured because the whole section is a mess. This wasn’t good enough for her, she wants me to tell her exactly what it ate and I just don’t know and don’t want to spend hours trying to figure it out when I don’t even know if it can be figured out.ETA 2 - My cats are house cats, they don’t go in my garden and aren’t at risk of getting sick from whatever my gardener is growing. My garden is huge and what is growing changes often so no I don’t keep track of what is planted.Update - I blocked ex friend after dozens of nasty calls and texts. But I got an update from a mutual friend. The dog is at dog hospital, dog is pretty sick, but is expected to make a full recovery. I managed to contact my gardener eventually, it looks like the dog ate some potatoes or something? A lot was destroyed so even my gardener isn’t 100% sure what was eaten, but he thinks maybe the pesticides were the problem. All info from gardener was passed to ex friend.Ex friend has seen this post and is very angry about it. Everyone say hi to Suzanne!",

I love Sofia and Parker as their aunt. And at the same time, I want a peaceful evening to celebrate my birthday instead of dealing with Sofia and Parker’s behavior, because I know Angel isn’t going to discipline them herself.Angel acted understanding when I made this request and explained my reasons to her in-person, but then she went online and made a Facebook post accusing me of hating Sofia and Parker and trying to punish Angel by only inviting our sister Jessica’s kid Megan to my birthday dinner. (Nevermind that Megan is 17 and is practically an adult herself.)Several of our relatives and mutual acquaintances called me out and said I was an asshole and was excluding a 10 and 7-year-old. I responding to Angel’s post by sharing two videos of Sofia and Parker misbehaving while Angel did nothing.The first video was a recording taken by Megan, where Sofia and Parker were throwing tantrums and yelling at her. Megan was trying to calm Sofia and Parker down while Angel was on her tablet ignoring the situation.The other video was one that Angel took. Sofia and Parker were yelling, throwing toys at each other, and Parker even called his sister a bad word. Angel was laughing as if it were funny and was again doing nothing to discipline Sofia or Parker.I wrote alongside the videos that I love Sofia and Parker as their aunt. But at the same time, I want a peaceful evening to celebrate my birthday. And I don’t want to be stuck disciplining Sofia and Parker because clearly Angel won’t. Angel ended up not coming to my birthday at all.My parents told me that I was in the wrong for sharing those videos, because everyone’s children have acted up and posting those videos didn’t accomplish anything besides embarrassing Angel.They also said I could have compromised by having a “Nobody under 18” rule for my birthday dinner. Megan would not be able to attend but then Sofia and Parker wouldn’t feel excluded. I do not see how that would be fair to myself or Megan. AITA For not wanting to make compromises for my birthday dinner?Edit: Hello, I wanted to clarify some common concerns about the videos. Firstly, both me and Angel's Facebooks are private, so the only people who are able to view the videos are people who either I or Angel have added as friends. A stranger will not be able to see them.Angel had already posted the video that she recorded of Sofia and Parker misbehaving, so I merely linked it. Megan had already posted the video that she recorded, just on a different social media platform. I am uncertain if Megan's social media is private, but no strangers will be able to view the videos from my and Angel's Facebook accounts.",

Our oldest spent most of his time on vacation doing his own thing, having breakfast and dinner with the family but being seldom seen otherwise. My wife and I enjoyed spending time with out kids, but we also did some couple's activities.There are clubs on the boat for kids, and our 13yo really enjoyed them, but our 7yo didn't and kept wanting to spend the day with his sister, who we'd given carte blanche to do her own thing as long as she ate with us and answered when we messaged her. She was a good sport and took her little brother on most of her adventures, swimming with him, taking him to trivia and doing the animation classes with him. I felt like this was very sweet of her and showed a great deal of maturity. The second to last day of the cruise I took her to the gift shop and told her to pick out whatever she wanted as thanks for looking after her brother.She was very excited and ended up picking out a dress. The dress was $80. She wore it to dinner that night, and when she told her mom I bought it for her my wife gave me a weird look. After dinner she asked me why the hell I did that. I explained that it was a reward for looking after her brother. She said we can't buy an $80 dress for our daughter and nothing for our sons. I said we didn't get them nothing; we took them on a cruise.My wife said I'm an idiot. I don't think so. We got some trinkets for the younger boys, about $20 worth of stuff. My wife thinks I fucked up and said I should apologize to the boys. I refuse. We took our adult son on a vacation that cost thousands of dollars, he has no reason to resent his sister being rewarded for being thoughtful. If we got our 7yo and 13yo a really expensive souvenir, it would probably be lost or broken. She still thinks I was an asshole though.Clarification: A lot of commentors seem to think we asked our daughter to babysit her brother. That's not really the case. What kept happening was that she would tell us her plans for the day and 7yo would say he'd rather do that than go to the kid's club, and she would agree to let him come with her. So it was more just her being a nice sister than actual babysitting. She always had the ability to drop him off at the club. That's why I wanted to reward her, because I thought it was so sweet of her not to do that and to make her brother feel good about his cool older sister wanting to hang out with him.",

He was mad, but his girlfriend looked so embarrassed. They ended up leaving.The party was very awkward after that. A lot of people left early. My girlfriend's mom was furious at me, because she wanted her son to stop living in sin and I ruined it. My girlfriend said I was sweet but didn't need to do that. Her brother texted me calling me a prick.Was I an asshole for telling them to have some class?",

	"body" : "My wife is currently battling cancer, and one of the things she’s told me she’s struggling with the most was losing her hair. She’s been given a near 100% chance of survival since we caught it early, but the chemotherapy has destroyed her hair anyway, and she had to shave what was left of it off a few weeks ago.Not long after that, she suggested we attempt to get our 17 year old daughter, Anna, to do so as well. Anna has very long hair that she puts a lot of care into so I felt it was appropriate to ask her in private if she wanted to/would be willing to do such a thing. She told me that she didn’t want to cut her hair and I figured that was the end of that.However yesterday they came home from a “girls shopping trip”, something they do every so often, and Anna had a buzzed haircut. That struck me as odd after what she’d said, so after dinner I talked to her and she told me that my wife had said she would never forgive Anna if she didn’t show her support by buzzing her head. I asked her if she was happy about it and she said that she wasn’t.When I went to bed, I brought it up with my wife and she said “it was Anna’s choice to or not, I just told her how I’d see the situation.”I told her off, saying she needed to respect Anna’s personal choices and that a 17 year old girl being against shaving her head wasn’t exactly out of the ordinary, however my wife simply said it was to show support for her.I’ve been sleeping on the couch since. I love my wife, and I understand that she’s going through something traumatic, however her attitude comes off as very manipulative to me, and that’s not behavior I feel I can personally accept. I’m not sure if I can move past this to continue the relationship.AITA?",

They have already wasted an entire bottle of my shampoo by storing it upside down after they touched it for some reason. It all dripped out the spout which is not engineered for that.I talked to both of them and I explained that they should not touch my stuff and that if they accidentally tip over my shampoo it was meant to be stored with the lid at the top.I came home last week to find my shampoo leaking out of the bottle again.

	"body" : "One of my good friends from college was getting married (call him Tom) to his wife (call her Liz) and asked me to be one of his groomsmen. I was honored, I haven’t seen him in a while because I live across the country.When I arrived to his city, I was ‘assigned’ a bridesmaid call her Kelly. Now Kelly is a lovely woman however, I think we were only assigned each other because we are both black. Liz starts telling me that we are both single and perfect for each other, but there was nothing to indicate that at all besides us both being black. I should add as well that Liz had a lot more bridesmaids than Tom had as groomsmen.The first night the entire wedding party went out and it became clear that Kelly wanted to hook up. I was not into her at all so I kindly turned her down. She then starts interrogating me as to why, I try to give a generic answer but she starts listing off all of the reason why we are so perfect together.  I end up saying that I don’t do the whole short term type thing and as we both live in completely different states there is no future here. She ends up cooling off but then tells me that she respects me more for that and that I am a stand up guy, and the type of guy that she is looking for.During the rest of the time we are there, one of the other ‘unmatched’ bridesmaids (call her Jen) starts messaging me privately and we hit it off. The next day wedding ceremony goes well, we have the reception and me and Kelly do our entrance together and then dance together for a bit. After a bit, I go to the bar and Jen and I start to dance. At this point Kelly is giving me dirty looks. I just ignore it and continue having a good time.All is going well until when I am at the bar, Kelly and the Liz confront me and starts saying that me dancing with Jen is inappropriate. They start saying she is too young for me that it looks creepy. (FWIW I am 32 and she is 24 about to turn 25). I am like oh it’s okay me and Jen are just friends. Liz at this point is angry with me and starts saying that Jen is in college (She is doing her Masters) and that this is her wedding and she doesn’t want to see that. Then Kelly starts saying that I must have a fetish for White women. At this point I realize that there is no logical argument I can make.I tell Kelly and Liz that I really enjoyed the wedding but I need to go to bed early for my flight the next day. I leave and go up to my hotel. 15 minutes later Jen leaves early.  5 minutes after Jen came up, we both get kicked out of the wedding party chat.I later find out from Tom that Kelly was crying her eyes out. And that it messed up the night for Liz as well. He told me that he isn’t mad at me because he told Liz from the start that Kelly isn’t going to be my type, but instead Liz really wanted to set Kelly up. At this point I feel terrible that I made it so Liz was not able to enjoy her special night, as for Kelly I just wish she got no means no.",

	"title" : "AITA for 'poisoning' housemate who ate my food without my permission and ended up in the ER?",
	"body" : "I (19m) recently moved into a shared place and there is someone who keeps stealing my food. At first I thought it was just a mistake but even my leftovers were being eaten. It was very clear that the person was doing it on purpose. I spoke to my housemates about how I would just prefer to be asked first but they were nonchalant about it and none of them admitted to doing it and I haven't caught anyone in the act so I just tried to ignore it as it only happened every couple of days or so.A few days ago I came home from work with a carton of eggs that I found while dumpster diving and some bread. I wanted to give the eggs the water test first before eating them just to make sure that they are safe to consume but I was too tired and went to bed early without eating. The next day I found out that one of my housemates got so sick he ended up having to go to the emergency room. My eggs were not in the fridge where I left them but I saw the carton and shells in the trash and my bread was opened. I had a hunch that it was him because there was a possibility that the eggs had gone bad but I was also annoyed at the fact that he helped himself to my food without asking.When he came back, I asked him if he had eaten my eggs and bread but he denied. I then said okay but I hope whoever ate them doesn't get as sick as you did because I found the eggs in a dumpster. His face immediately dropped and he looked visibly uncomfortable. He got angry and went from saying that he may have consumed the food by mistake as he wasn't paying attention and doesn't exactly remember and accusing me of poisoning him.He said that it's a health hazard to bring such food in communal spaces without warning everyone first as it's not uncommon for people in shared places to eat other people's food by mistake. He hasn't spoken to me since then and my housemates are siding with him and called me disgusting for doing that. A part of me feels like I wasn't wrong because they were MY eggs that I was fully intending on eating and I didn't think I had to warn people against eating food that didn't belong to them but I also do feel bad and guilty that he got sick. So Reddit please tell me if I was in the wrong?EDIT; Just to clarify because I see comments that suggest that I may have done it on purpose, I didn't. I have been dumpster diving for some of my food recently so I was fully intending on eating it just like I have been eating the food that I have been finding while dumpster diving. I try to exercise caution and thankfully it hasn't made me sick yet but had he not eaten it, I was probably going to end up in the ER myself because I was obviously going to eat it.I didn't randomly do it just to try bait and catch whoever has been eating my food. Food poisoning is not a joke. As I said I just moved recently and I'm just trying to get on my feet. I also understand that although I make sure to wipe my food first, ultimately it is gross to put food that came from a dumpster in a communal fridge or pantry and will not continue to do so. I will just put it in my room from now on.",

It's not what my name was but it's close. My parents are hippies and gave their oldest son a girl's name to \"stick it to the man\" and  I will never forgive them for it. That name caused me to be bullied and damaged my professional life in ways I cannot describe.My sister is pregnant with her first child. A girl. She and her husband are ecstatic, it just sucks that she inherited my parent's stupid propensity to see their children as fashion statements. Last night, she revealed to the family the name of her daughter.It's Krxstxl. She wants to name her daughter Krxstxl. Confused, the name is pronounced Crystal. I already don't like that name but it's at least appropriate. I was not surprised to learn that my mom helped come up with the name.When she told me, I told her it was a terrible idea. If she wants to name her Crystal, name her Crystal. She tried to explain to me why the x's are there and I just told her it does not matter. She's naming a human, not a dog. I don't care what kind of fashion statement she's trying to make, this is a person who will have to live with that name until they die or has it changed.She and my mom brushed me off as just complaining because I was never able to accept my name. I told my sister she was being either selfish, stupid, or an incredibly strong combination of the two if she thinks her daughter will want a stupid name like Krxstxl. We got into an argument and I told her I already see her and her husband as shitty parents for using their kid to be off-brand with her name and left right after.My sister is not taking it well at all and my mom is furious with me. I'm starting to wonder if I was too harsh. I will not change my opinion on that incredibly stupid name. But I'm wondering if branding her as a shitty parent was too far.",

The activities seemed perfect, and I was looking forward to this for months because I wanted to propose to her at the end of the trip.5 days before the trip, Sarah dropped the ball on me that she invited 2 of her friends to meet her there. I was upset because I wanted to spend 1:1 time with Sarah for our anniversary. I feel like it was plain and clear that this was a trip for just us. Even though I expressed my concerns, Sarah insisted that her friends already made plans to come and won't back out.I decided to accept this because there was no way for me to force her friends to not come (I wish I fought more on this). I figured we could make some changes to our plans, and I would still be able to propose to her privately. Sarah essentially blew me off for her friends and we didn't get any private time.After 3 days of being in second place, I decided to leave the trip and head home. I told Sarah why I was leaving, and she was upset. She told her friends about my decision, and I was ganged up on. They said we were all having a great time. She thinks I'm being a jerk for making her pick between her friends and me (even though her friends weren't invited in the first place). I never had personal issues with her friends prior to this trip. I never made Sarah pick between me or her friends because everyone needs friends outside of a relationship.I'm at home now and thinking about everything. I have a day to myself before Sarah comes home, so at least I get to relax a bit. Sarah and her friends think I'm overreacting and think I ruined the trip.

They were also quite wealthy as well.They both passed 4 years ago a month apart. They gave me the property (because \"I would appreciate and respect it more\") while my mom and sister(s) got money and other assets(overall valued moer than the property).In the past 4 years, I turned part of the property into a venue for mainly weddings (GPs knew of this idea and thought it was a good one).We are busy and usually booked about 8 months out. My sister got engaged 1.5 years ago and said she wasn't to get married at the property. I said yes, just let me know the date as soon as possible so I can make sure it is \"booked.\"I never got a date.

He and my mum have 2 kids in 9 years of marriage, I’m not his own and it’s clear I’m a reminder that his wife was a non-virgin divorced woman before him so of course I’m being treated like a guest and my mum is allowing it because she thinks the sun shines out of his ass. He doesn’t need my money to pay rent, plus I don’t have much and he wants £100 per month.

I’m doing STEM subjects and I’m hoping to fulfil my offer for a medicine course at a good university. I’m aiming for A* A* A* A which will take a lot of studying, and if I have to get a job it will be difficult to maintain that level of studying that I need to do.I’m literally moving out in September. (Idk if the university finances differ in the USA and Ik this platform is predominantly American, so in the UK uni is funded by loans, and these loans cover everything and are 100% my responsibility and my parents won’t be financing anything).

Her house is an hour away but my school is in the middle (30 mins each way if that makes sense). She said she has a guest room free so I can save my money for uni. This benefits me most so I took her up on the offer.My mother keeps crying that I’m leaving already, so my step dad is annoyed. We got into an argument where he said he’s just treating me like a tenant to prepare me for the real world, so I said “do tenants not have the right to leave?” Which annoyed him further. My step dad says im hurting my mother and taking resources from my aunt because im “too entitled” to pay rent. This is just what’s best for me. I said I’d visit. AITA?",

Which I usually do because I'm really selfconscious about showing my prosthetic.These days I can pretty mch do anything I like without issues, walking, running, going up stairs, etc. The main issue is keeping my balance when there are sudden changes in movement, in places like trains and busses. Which is where the topic of this post comes in.I was riding the train and sat down in the seat reserved for disabled, elderly and pregnant women. It was pretty busy so there were no other seats available, and a few stops later a woman came up to me telling me I needed to move, because she needs that seat and I shouldn't be sitting there. I told her I was sorry, but I needed the seat myself.

It will be around 100-150 people total. My husband and I are paying for this all ourselves, as well as my grandma who said she doesn't care one way or the other on this issue. She just loves weddings.We have a lot of kids in our family so we decided against making it child-free but we did decide to make it dry. So there will be no alcohol of any kind at our wedding. Honestly, this doesn't have anything to do with there being kids there but due to the fact that my fiancé and I don't drink. Nothing against people who do, it's just not for us and we don't want to. On top of that, we only really drink water. We rarely, if ever, drink soda so most of the time it's only water with the occasional juice and milk. We don't even drink coffee.So obviously the food (which is a part my grandma is not paying for) is going to be expensive for that many people. We are having our wedding catered so everyone will have a good choice of food to choose from but to drink only water will be provided. We don't want to have to pay for alcohol or soda, it is just an large added expense when we can just do filtered water for a MUCH cheaper cost.Well, when family and friends found out being got angry. Some didn't really care but some are really upset about it. Saying that I can just have an open bar so I don't have to pay for drinks (we could, but still have to pay for the bartender and we just really don't want to bother with alcohol there). Or we should at least have soda because how can we expect everyone to drink ONLY water? The kids will be upset. The wedding will be boring. That this is not how weddings work. Etc.So AITA? I didn't think this would be a problem! It's only water. I mean, don't most people drink water everyday anyway? Should we pay the extra to have soda to make the family happy?",

He can do no wrong and is just misunderstood.My parents are retired and on a fixed budget. I do well for myself and I help them out. I give them maybe $500 a month to help with groceries and bills. Every once in a while I will give them extra for an unexpected expense. No questions asked.My mom asked me for $2,000. I sent it to her. Strangely enough I ran into my brother at a family wedding I had been told he could not afford to attend because it was a destination wedding. Weird.  Funny story he actually missed the wedding because he hooked up with some rando on an excursion and went to their resort. It was our cousin's wedding and my aunt was pissed. She had to make special arrangements to get him included on the trip since he only got the money last minute. She said my mom shouldn't have given him the money if he wasn't even going to show up.Then she shut up after she saw the look on my face.I enjoyed the wedding and had a great time. When I got home I went to see my parents. I asked my mom why she had asked for the $2,000. She lied and said something for the house. I asked what. She couldn't say. I told her what my aunt said. I told her and my father that from now on I wanted receipts for any money I gave them. I said I have no problem helping them but I will be damned if I work my ass off for her to give my money to my piece of shit brother.She started crying and my dad said that they weren't children and didn't answer to me. I agreed and walked out.I didn't talk to them for two months. My aunt called me yesterday and told me that my parents were thinking of going to.the food bank since they didn't have any money. I said I had given them $2,000 a couple of months ago and that was more than my family of three spent on food on that time. She said I knew damn well they had given my money to my brother. I told her that he should probably pay them back then. She said I was being a bitch.AITA?",

It won't be difficult because I'm putting the older one in charge of the younger one.

She was sent the documentary Dominion by a vegan friend of hers and ever since has said nonvegan food is \"revolting\" and refuses to eat it. After a long conversation I agreed to go vegetarian and be vegan in the house and around her, which she was happy with. She also decided our son should be vegan, which after seeing a dietician I also agreed with. Things have been fine with this arrangement until a few months ago when I began finding wrappers from nonvegan candy and even burgers from McDonald's in my sons school bag which he had been buying with chore money.I had a conversation with my son and he confessed he felt lonely and excluded eating vegan around his friends and that they always had much better candy than he did and it wasn't fair. I decided I didn't want him spending his pocket money on snacks and throwing out the vegan snacks we actually brought him instead of buying games etc, it made no sense, but I also know the way my wife feels about nonvegan products. So, I began buying my son what he wanted on our way to football practise instead.Long story short, my wife recently found out what has been going on and completely flipped out. She called me an animal abuse enabler and a few other names and said I was corrupting our son. Now she is not speaking to me, our son panicked and told her I had bought the snacks for him and he didn't know they weren't vegan (I don't blame him for that, he just doesn't want to be in trouble with mom)AITA here?",

I thought we were pretty happy, but last year he dumped me pretty suddenly. I tried to figure out what went wrong, but he said it was \"personal\" and that I should respect his space.During this time, my best friend \"Stacy\" and her fiancé \"Tom\" were my rocks, letting me crash at their place and just being overwhelmingly supportive and loving. When Stacy asked me to be her maid-of-honor, I thought it was a no-brainer and happily took on the task.Fast forward to what happened this weekend: the morning of the wedding, Tom asked me to meet him for breakfast super early in the AM before all of the festivities. I thought it was weird but assumed he maybe wanted me to pass something on to Stacy.What happened instead was that Tom let me know that a few days prior, Stacy admitted to him that she had an affair with John, which was what lead to my breakup. He said that Stacy wanted to come clean to \"start their marriage fresh\", and that he was forgiving her to move forward.He had gone back and forth between telling me, and finally decided to spill the beans. I guess he had expected me to forgive Stacy too because the affair was \"so long ago\". The opposite pretty much happened, and I just walked out on the wedding.It ended up causing a huge mess because I was basically running the whole show (Stacy made me do everything, so she didn't even know what was happening at certain times or who to call). Not only that, but everyone realized that the MOH wasn't there (she had headshots and bios of the party on her wedding page), and news of the affair eventually got out because her cousin knew John.Stacy and Tom have both been slandering me online now, saying that I ruined their once in a lifetime moment. Some of their friends are on their side, saying that I should have handled the situation more privately, and at least stuck out the wedding since it was so last minute. I personally don't know what Tom expected, but either way I've been getting bombarded with texts and I heard that Stacy has been so upset she's had to take time off work, which does make me feel like an AH.

We have a pretty toxic free relationship but there’s quite a bit of tension when it comes to me being vegetarian. I’ve been vegetarian since 11 and I have very strict morals around it. The one thing John has a problem with is me refusing to spend my money on meat. Ever since I started making my own money, I swore to myself that I would never spend a cent of it on meat. On our dates, we usually spilt the bill and sometimes he pays for it all. I told him if he orders something meat-free, I’d happily pay for both of us but he never does. When he pays for my food, it’s when I’ve spend money on the activity. Normally concerts and festivals. That’s me paying €120+ on tickets and him spending maybe €50 on foodHis birthday was a few days ago and we went out for dinner at his favourite fancy restaurant. He got the most expensive steak they had along with a side salad and a bottle of wine. When we finished our food, I asked the waiter to spilt the bill and John looked at me shocked. He asked if I was joking and I said no. Then he told me he thought I was going to pay since it was his birthday and he didn’t budget for the meal. I asked him why he thought I’d pay since I’ve been very clear about my rule but he couldn’t give me a reason other than it being his birthday.I told him I’d pay for the wine and the side salad, but he’d need to pay for the steak. He was furious with me and stormed off to the bathroom. I paid for my meal, the wine and the salad and waited for him to come back. He didn’t. After waiting for 20 minutes, I left.I found him sitting on a bench near where we parked the car. I asked him why he left and reminded him he needed to pay. He looked shocked when I said that and asked me if I didn’t pay. I told him I’d paid for everything but the meat and he lost it. He started yelling at me, telling me I was selfish, that I needed to grow up. I stayed calm and told him he needed to go back and pay. He scoffed and walked away. I ended up driving home without him.Now he’s saying it’s my fault that he can’t show his face in his favourite restaurant since he dined and ditched. It’s a pretty small restaurant so he’d 100% be recognised and kicked out.So, aita?EDIT: To the people commenting about me not “treating” him on his birthday, yes, I did. I even dipped into my savings for his present.EDIT 2: I did not “take him out” for dinner. He was the one that suggested it.",

	"body" : "I (56m) have 5 children. This is about 3 of them Casey (26f), Alex (31nb) and Tom (34m). The names are not their true names.My daughter Casey is getting married this winter to her fiancé Max (27m)who she has been together with for about 4 years. I am covering the majority of the wedding expenses as Max's family lives in a different country and with the currency exchange rate they won't be able to afford the wedding and both to come to the wedding. I have no issues with it and just want my little girl to be happy.Last week while Casey was away, my children Alex and Tom came to visit with their families and we were talking about wedding invitations. I was surprised to hear that they haven't received their wedding invitations, so I just thought that Casey haven't sent them out yet for everyone, until my oldest and youngest daughter's pointed out they have received their invitations with their kids and partners invited. I called my sister who also said Casey has invited their whole family to the wedding too and she received hers a while back, so I immediately saw red. Both Alex and Tom have husbands and have children (adopted) and it seemed Casey has excluded them because of their choices. It also seemed weird since Casey has always been close to them and supported them when they came out as non binary and gay respectively.I have called Casey and demanded an explanation. My daughter said that Max and his family don't feel comfortable with couples that are not traditional and it goes against their culture and that she hopes for my understanding. I have told her if that's the case I will not be walking her down the isle and pull out from paying for her wedding, as she can not exclude her family like this when they did nothing wrong and if her future in laws opinion is so important to her, they can pay for the wedding. As a result Casey has called me an asshole and hanged up crying. My children are on my side, my wife is torn as she understands where Casey comes from but agrees she shouldn't have excluded her siblings like this.Edit: just want to add something about my wife. When I said she is torn and gets where Casey is coming from, it doesn't mean that she supports Casey's decision to exclude her siblings. She doesn't approve it in the slightest, however as a mother of our children she feels she should be there for all her children if they need her or want to talk, even if she doesn't agree with their choices. She is still deeply hurt by what Casey has said as she absolutely adores Alex's and Tom's husband's and their children.",

Well, last year, he started bringing a boy around, and it was obvious they were dating, to the point I figured that he knew I knew, and it wanst a big deal to anyone.Well, apparently, I was wrong.After school yesterday he and his boyfriend came up to me and said there was something really important they needed to tell me. My son said that they were dating and had been for a year. Well... I was surprised that he wasn't aware I knew and was a bit thrown off. My mouth moved faster than my brain and I said \"Well, thats pretty fucking gay.\"Now, I thought it was peak comedy, since it is infact gay. However, I understand using the word gay in that way gives it a very negative undertone, hence the mouth faster than brain comment.Now my son and I are usually pretty \"edgy\" with our humor, this being fairly tame for the stuff we joke about. While probably not appropriate for the situation, it wasn't our norm for a conversation between us. However, he and his boyfriend were very, very upset and left.I'm probably the asshole but I thought I would check, and see if yall had some advice on what I can say to fix it. He currently won't respond to my texts or calls.Iiiiii did not expect this to gain so much traction. It's a bit intimidating, lol. I am reading all the comments, though.

And the hot water tank isn't enough for his family and he wants a new one. I told him to go ahead. He then proceeded to take the cost of the hot water tank and installation of of that month's rent. I reminded him of our agreement. He said he wasn't making improvements to my property for free. I said that the old hot water tank was fine and he made the decision to replace it. Big argument and I didn't want to fight so I said that he was not allowed to make any further changes to the house without my explicit agreement.So he stopped doing maintenance as a protest.The house itself is not pretty but it is solid. It is old and the wiring in it was not meant for all the modern electronics we have.He wanted to add a new breaker box and run more outlets. I said no thanks. I cannot afford that since I'm not making any money on the house. He started getting bitchy about it and the rent started getting paid late.I tried talking to him but he said that he had to buy some stuff for the house and he was low on cash.So I sold the house. While the house itself isn't great it is in an older part of the city and the property itself is a quarter of an acre. Every time a house sells in the neighborhood it is snapped up by developers and tuned into multi family units. Or one guy built a McMansion on his land.I know a lot of the developers and I didn't even need to list the house to have it sold in less than a week.My brother found out when he was served with an eviction notice. He called me to ask WTF. So I told him that the house was causing me headaches and I had an opportunity to make some money and I took it. He said I should have offered him a chance to buy it. I said that he was having trouble making rent. How was he going to qualify for a mortgage. He said I'm an asshole and that he has the money he was waiting to make me an offer.  I asked him if he had money why he was late on his rent.He started bad-mouthing me to all our family. A few of them took his side and tried to say I was being an asshole so I offered all of them a chance to clear his debt to me if they wanted to share their opinion. None of them took me up on the offer.My parents are on my side and they said I shouldn't have rented to him in the first place.I feel bad for my sister-in-law and the kids but I'm not going to spend the rest of my life subsidizing his.",

Nevertheless, I have my own life and I still love them and I try not to think of that in any capacity. They are happy and that's good for them.With that background out of the way. I am getting married soon and I wanted my parents to be there ofc. They were happy for me and it was great. Then my SO and I got to arranging everything for the wedding and we eventually began arranging the seating. I wanted to run my seating plan by my parents as they know some people better so I emailed it to them and asked them to look it over. They looked it over and then they called me that I had missed a seat for Dave (fake name for their significant other). I told them I didn't think Dave would be coming. They said they would be all coming and I said I'm not sure if its a good idea. I try to tip-toe to gently tell them to not bring Dave but they were insistent, so I was frank with them. I told them I was uncomfortable with Dave coming and I wanted to share my special day with them, not Dave. I tried to explain why I didn't think it was appropriate.At this point, things took a turn for the worse. We had a back and forth which basically devolved into a fight. Eventually, they basically said they'd much rather just not come if they couldn't come as a couple. I, in a moment of anger, then said \"great, then don't come\" in a passive aggressive tone.I haven't talked to my parents since then.

I kept asking and she’d make up excuses. I found it weird.Now, my sister is getting married and she wanted to wear the dress. This was our mother’s dress and we always agreed we’d each wear it. I told my friend I need it back. She claimed she couldn’t find it. I was perplexed because how does it just get up and walk away? She apologized and offered to pay me the cost of the dress, which I turned down because it wasn’t about money. The dress was sentimental and I felt terrible my sister couldn’t wear it.My friend and her husband went away. I was there to water their plants and feed their dogs. I decided to go look myself. The closet was very cluttered. I eventually found the dress. I can totally believe that she missed where it was and she wasn’t being malicious in the slightest.

He was 22 at the time, and is now looking to become a master plumber and start his own business.At my wedding, in which he was the best man, he decided that during his speech he would give us all a big surprise and decided to propose to his long time girlfriend. Me and my wife were appalled. We both feel like he stole the shine from our day. Everyone else in our families were so excited and kept taking pictures with her, looking at the ring, etc.I decided to fire him the very next day. He still doesn’t understand why. He claims I’m being selfish and irrational, and our parents agree. They’re saying that “business should be separate from our personal lives”, but I just can’t overlook what he did and how he ruined our day. Am I overthinking this??EDIT: I should have mentioned this, but he will be getting severance. He is still my brother, and I wouldn’t let him lose his home over this. But as a small business I can’t imagine seeing him every day at work. Not now at least.EDIT 2: I reached out to him and we plan on speaking later today in person.EDIT 3: I love all of the people who say “you’ve been looking for a reason to fire him” or “you’re just jealous”. He was my best man. I never felt upset about him opening his own business, in fact he has my complete blessing. This job was only supposed to be to get him on his feet again. I’m so happy he liked the field and wants to go further in it. There was no malice before this incident.",

	"body" : "I (24) got pregnant while I was taking a gap year traveling. I met an older guy, nothing gross, I was 19 he was 23. We had fun. I was working in a bar to make money while I explored his city.When I got pregnant he lost interest really quickly. I understood but I am pro choice. And I chose not to terminate.I went home and had my son. I also made sure to get child support. He could afford it. He did fight it though. I had to prove paternity and everything.Through that his parents found out. They are well off. They have met my son and they truly do seem to love him. They have provided gifts for his birthday and Christmas. They helped me with extra money so I could complete my university without going into debt. They have taken us on vacation with them so they could spend time with him. They aren't my biggest fans but we are cordial to each other.Three months ago my son's father passed away. He got drunk at his bachelor party, tripped on the sidewalk, and hit his head. And that was all she wrote.My son and I attended the funeral. We spent a week in that city so his grandparents could see him.They approached me with an offer. They had no other children or grandchildren. Their son was only 28 so he had lots of time to provide them legitimate kids (they did not say this I'm just assuming) so they never thought about my son's name.They said that if I changed his surname to theirs legally they would make him their primary heir. I think this is dumb. He is their only grandchild and they would deny him an inheritance because of his last name?I said I would consider it, to be polite, and have left it at that. I actually have a pretty good life as it is. My family has been very supportive. And because of the whole court thing my son's father had to have life insurance with him as the beneficiary.Would it be nice for my kid to get a big sum of money. Yes. Do I want him to have the surname of a man who didn't want him, see him, or love him? No.I have been talking to my family about it and a few of them think I'm being an asshole for giving up.this kind of money for my son. It is generational wealth and I'm making the decision based on emotion. I think they are assholes for thinking money is the only thing that matters.I think I will tell my son's grandparents that they can talk to him about it when he is 16.

I live in a small subdivision and have 5 neighbors total on my street.For the past few years during the winter when we're getting a lot of snow or a bad storms, as I'm leaving for my overnight shift at around 8-9pm I'll put my wifes windshield wipers up on her car and do a quick walk around to my other 5 neighbors and put their windshield wipers up on their cars (obviously not if they're outside or something, but if it looks like they're in for the night). Many of them forget to do this, as many of them have children and it typically slips their mind, and their wipers will be frozen to their car in the morning.It's just something nice I like to do to look out for my neighbors. They're all always grateful of this and thank me for it. Many of them started doing it too and there will be nights where I'll forget to put mind and my wifes up, and in the morning one of the neighbors has done it for us.Anyway recently one of our neighbor's moved and a new family moved in as of last week. It's a young couple and their two young children. The other night I was leaving for my overnight shift at around 9pm. It was snowing really heavy and we were supposed to be getting almost 30cm of snow and it was FREEZING out. So I put my wifes wipers up and do my usual quick walk around to the other neighbors.I was hesitant when I reached my new neighbors house, as I've only introduced myself once, but did it anyway. As I was putting the second wiper up on their pick up truck the husband came charging out of his front door yelling \"HEY WHAT THE F*CK ARE YOU DOING TO MY TRUCK?\" I tried to explain to him I was just putting his wipers up to help him. He continued to scream at me to \"get the hell off my property and don't touch my shit AGAIN!\". The wife then came out and started yelling at me too. I apologized and started walking away. Some of my other neighbors heard the commotion and came outside to see what was happening.They tried explaining to him too that it's just something we do, both of them wasn't having it.Fast forward to this morning, I'm arriving home from my overnight shift and as I'm walking in I see the wife of this couple struggling outside to break the ice off the windshield wipers of the truck. Guess she was trying to take her kids to school and the wipers were frozen solid on the car.She sees me and yells over \"Hey there! Do you mind giving me a hand please?\" I look over to her and yell back \"No sorry, thought I was to never touch your shit again ma'am\" and walked back inside. She yelled back at me \"wow AH!\".Told my wife about this, she thinks I should've helped her because she was just trying to get her kids to school.

She thinks she is fixing stuff, but not all foods need turmeric in it.This saturday, I received 40lbs of tomatoes, it took me the whole weekend to turn it into a sauce that I was planning to can. I can it plain, then add whatever seasonings and herbs it needs, depending on the recipe.They came to take a bag of spare clothes for one of their kids, and in the 5 minutes it took me to get it, she managed to get into the kitchen, add salt, pepper, turmeric, olive oil, garlic powder and italian herbs to all 5 of the pots that were simmering on the stove.And when I told asked her what she was doing, she had the audacity to say \"this sauce needed some taste, I added it for you\".

Before this incident, I only ever asked her to babysit once because I had no one else and I paid her $15/hr (at the time, above minimum wage).This past Saturday, Polly was due to hang out with some friends. For a couple of days, Trevor was ill, but testing negative for Covid. That day, he spiked a very high fever and I had to take him to the ER. I asked Polly to watch Cassie as the sitters weren’t responding. I apologized that she’d have to miss out on time with friends but said I’d pay her and she could even have her friends over our place. Polly pitched a fit and asked why I couldn’t send Cassie to the neighbors. We don’t know them.

We don't meet them very often because they live in my bf's home country. I don't want to reveal country names either for privacy reasons but my bf and I are of different nationalities and we both work in my country.The conflict happened during our last visit last weekend. We have been looking up houses to move in together and engagement rings. While we were having dinner, we mentioned this to his family as it's a big step in our relationship for us(we are not engaged yet.) His parents and brothers expressed their happiness for us then out of nowhere his youngest SIL asked \"So is she going to take the test?\"I asked \"what test?\".In summary, bf's family has this tradition where the future MIL tests future daughters-in-law to see if they are good enough for her sons. Apparently, his mother and aunts went through the same test. The tests include how clean they can keep a home, how well they can cook, their manners, etc. Basically life skills most people learn from childhood. I found it ridiculous because 1. If I'm good enough for my boyfriend, he should be the one deciding it. and 2. I don't fit in their targeted category. In his mom's words, you can't be a good SAHW and SAHM if you can't be a good homemaker and she wants to make sure of that.To be clear, his mom and all three of his brothers' wives are SAHMs and although I respect their choice, I am not quitting my career and did not under any circumstances make my bf think I could compromise on that. I hate house chores and I would rather buy homemaking gadgets and hire staff no matter the cost than have to do chores myself. I told my bf's mom all this and it caused an argument that eventually ruined dinner and in extension our visit.Bf doesn't care whether I'm a working wife or a SAHW but he thinks I should have just done the test because \"it's just a test\" and it's not like they would reject me if I failed it. He thinks it's a fun tradition that everyone was looking forward to and I should have gone along with it anyways.My boyfriend thinks I'm the AH and suggested I make this post. If I really am the asshole, I'm sure you guys will let me know so am I?EDIT: Adding this as it's been coming up. I know disclosing the country may or may not bring up some unwanted arguments that will violate the rules here. But just for context, it's a family tradition, not a national culture.",

	"body" : "—-update posted to my account—To make a novel short, my (F,27) brother (M,30) met his future wife (F, 28 - Ella) at a party three years ago. Honestly, we never got along but I always tried to put up a peaceful front because my brother seemed blissfully happy with her.Ella was mean to me a lot. Like A LOT. She would make comments about my weight, my makeup, and especially my dog. She hated animals and hated that I would bring my lab, Toast, to my parents or my brothers house. It always just felt like something aimed to hurt me.When the two got engaged she asked me to be her MOH since she has no sisters or many girl-friends and since my brother seemed thrilled, I obliged.What I failed to realize when I accepted the role was that to her MOH meant planning the entire wedding. Like I was booking venues, florists, jazz band, everything. Even worse she expected me to put my MY credit card down for all of it. (My brother and her are not exactly well off and since I have a well paying job I didn’t mind holding the deposits but it was starting to add up to a lot.) Everytime I asked Ella about it, she would say that it would all be paid back by her parents before the wedding.Well flash forward to last week, about three weeks before the wedding and she’s unbearable to be around. She can’t last more than a few sentences before snapping at anyone. So when I of course brought up the money, shit hit the fan.I asked if she had received the updated receipt of everything owed when she exploded. She called me a whole line of terrible names but the one that stuck out was her saying “What do you need the money for anyway? Your sick dog is dead now.”My beautiful Toasty died about a month before this after he fought the bravest battle with cancer. He was my soul dog and I was devastated.I blinked at her and simply left the room, having no energy to even respond to something so cruel. I went back to my car and after the 20 silent minute drive home, I parked the car and immediately called the vendors and cancelled any deposit under my card. Every. Single. One. After almost 20 calls, all that was left of her wedding was the dress and the flower arch.I texted my brother a short explanation. I told him that every vendor would be contacting him if they wished to keep their services and they were now responsible for covering everything. And that I would no longer be attending. It was a matter of minutes before my phone started to explode and I just turned it off.It’s been a few days and I haven’t talked to anyone but my mom, who thankfully understands where I was coming from. My brother has tried to call but I just feel terrible. Both about what I did and about what she said.I know what I did was extreme but I also couldn’t sit by and practically enable her cruelty anymore. I still can’t help but feel bad for ruining my brother’s big day. So I don’t know, am I the asshole for this?",

I get why she didn't want to help me look for the dog but I can't get over the lack of empathy and bordering selfish behavior of this either.My dog (6yo Heeler/Corgi mix) runs off at least once a week. Usually my fiance will help me find her but it's not without protest. I honestly didn't even know how she was getting out of our fenced yard so I installed cameras and found that she was scaling the 8ft fence. I ended up attaching \"spinners\" to the top of the fence thinking that would solve the issue but it didn't. I brought her out today and was playing with her when my phone rang. I was inside just long enough to grab my phone and my dog had gotten out.  I immediately went in search for her, thinking she couldn't have gotten far but I couldn't find her anywhere so I went back to the house and asked my fiance, who was curled up on the sofa, to come help me. She immediately said no. She said she was tired of chasing the dog, that she isn't dealing with it anymore and that I should have been out there watching her. I explained to her that I had been watching her and simply stepped away for point two seconds to grab my phone just inside the sliding door and she had escaped. She again said it wasn't her problem and she's not exhausting herself anymore to search for my dog. I won't even say it was unexpected because as I said, in the past she has always had a problem with helping me search but she's never said no. She just complained about it.At first I went and searched myself. After maybe a half hour I came back and asked her again to come help me and she snapped \"I said no! I am so tired of chasing that dog around multiple times a week when I'm already exhausted and throwing up constantly.\" I was panicked and unleashed some yelling, which involved me telling her she was a bitch who lacked empathy and that I was thoroughly disappointed with my decision to be with someone so heartless. It was out of pure fear and panic on my part and I did apologize later, after I found my dog, but she said \"Go fuck yourself\" and won't talk to me. AITA?

	"title" : "AITA for not telling my roommate I own the house?",
	"body" : "UPDATE POSTED IN MY PROFILEBrief backstory: About a year ago my last remaining grandparent passed away and my father inherited all assets, including a house. I had been saving for a nice down payment (at least 50%) so I could have a lower mortgage payment each month, thus allowing me to save money for travel. When my father inherited this house, which he had no interest in moving into yet, he offered to sell it to me for slightly below market rate, with the caveat that he and my stepmother could eventually move into the basement apartment. I agreed, because they're both incredible people who are not at all invasive and would give me my privacy if they lived there. So I paid a 60% down payment, financed the rest, and moved in.Present day: About six months ago I started considering renting out the finished basement apartment. It has two bedrooms, one bathroom, a living room, and a small kitchenette (sink, fridge, microwave, but no oven). A friend of mine said his brother was moving to my city and needed a place. He's a brand new teacher and doesn't make great money, so he needed a place that wasn't expensive. I offered to let him rent my basement for way less than market rate ($650) which would include utilities. He readily accepted and signed a year long lease.Well a few days ago he asked if he could start paying the landlord directly instead of giving me rent money each month. I was under the impression my friend had told him I own the house, so I was confused and I told him we don't have a landlord and that I'm the owner. He got very upset and screamed at me for \"lying for over six months\" and \"taking advantage of him\" by making him pay so much in rent. For the record, an apartment similar to the one in my house would be well over twice what he's paying me, closer to three times for something as nice. He asked how much of my mortgage he's covering and I said \"Why does that matter? You're getting a nice, quiet place to live, access to a full kitchen and laundry room, and you're paying an amount that you can afford. My personal finances aren't really a factor here.\" He stormed out of the room and slammed the basement door. He's still not speaking to me.I asked a few other friends and some family members, and most said I'm wrong for having him cover my mortgage payments. Only a few say I'm in the right. So AITA for having my roommate cover $650 of my $775/month mortgage?ETA: He has a lease so I won't be evicting him over this alone. If he does any damage or becomes hostile, I'll look at the eviction process. But for now, he will remain unless he chooses to break the lease (which I'd allow him to do if he wants).He also didn’t bother to read the lease before signing. The lease clearly states I’m the homeowner. I didn’t trick him or keep info from him. He simply didn’t read what he was signing.I didn’t get the house for almost free as some people choose to believe. My father sold it to me for about 75% of its value, more or less as an advance on “rent” he and my stepmother will pay when they move in here in a few years. We already agreed they won’t pay monthly rent but will contribute to utilities and groceries at that time. I also made a 60% down payment so I have quite a bit invested, as well at paying about $1500/month out of pocket for taxes, insurance, maintenance, utilities, etc.",

	"body" : "My girlfriend [31f] and I [36m] have been together for about two years now. We live together.About nine months ago I picked up running as a hobby and I have since grown quite fond of it. I currently run an average of 25 miles a week. A few months ago I decided I wanted to try a 5k or 10k, and after some Google searching found a 5k in my city that looked fun. I registered for it, paid the fee, and decided to start training specifically for it.I mentioned it in passing to my girlfriend that night, and she asked if she could come too. I was psyched about the idea of running a 5k with her and said yes, but warned her that she would probably want to start training because I was going for a sub-27 minute time, which might be tough for a complete beginner.She said she would like to train with me, which, again, sounded fun. The next morning I woke up at 5am for my run as I usually do, but my girlfriend was not up for it and told me she'd go later.This continued for a week, and then two weeks, and finally I managed to get her up once for a run. She was miserable the entire time and I basically didn't get any exercise.Last Friday, the day before the race, I asked if she was really up for it. She insisted she was. She then told me that she would just \"skip-gallop\" it, like she used to do with her mile runs in middle school. I asked her to demonstrate what a skip-gallop was, and she showed me this bizarre side-stepping gallop, as if she had casts on her legs. I told her it seemed like a really inefficient way to run, but she insisted it always worked for her.Saturday was the day of the race and right out of the gate she utilized her skip-gallop strategy. Two minutes in I realized that she was already completely gassed. She started asking me to wait so we could walk together. I apologized, told her I loved her, and left her behind to finish the race. I ended up with a time of 26:43, beating my goal.After the race I tried calling her but she wouldn't pick up. When I made my way back to the car I realized she had left me. I took an Uber home, and right when I walked in the door, I was met with cry-shrieking about how I ditched her. I tried to calm her down and explain that she kind of brought it on herself but she was not interested whatsoever.Yesterday she gave me the silent treatment all day.

She's struggling with money so I decided to help her and her fiance and pay the wedding dress. This allowed her to be able to buy her dream wedding gown that costs 7,000 ($). It's a lot for a dress but she literally cried because she wanted it.(This happened few days before we agreed to go buy the dress). We were eating dinner at my parents home and my cousin and aunt were there.  My aunt was asking my sister about the wedding and my sister said that everything was going according to plan and then casually laughed and said \"let's just hope he won't ran away with a pregnant mistress or something in our wedding day..\".

It happened so fast I got up and started screaming at her calling her an idiot but my parents asked me to take it easy and she said it was a joke and she didn't \"think\" I'd react so intensely. My aunt remained seated and my cousin asked me to calm down and drink some water but I grabbed my stuff and as I was getting ready, I told my sister she was getting 0 dollars for her dream wedding dress then I walked out. I heard louder commotion as I walked and my dad and cousin followed me outside trying to talk but I asked to be left alone.My and dad spoke to saying I was too harsh on my sister over a joke and said that I know this is how she is with her dark sense of humor.

They want me to reconsider my decision since it might damage my relationship with my sister but I refused.Did I overreact?Info: it's my aunt that would usually bring up what happened from time to time and say stuff like \"if what happened didn't happen you would've had at least 2 kids now\" or \"do you know what day it is? your wedding anniversary !\" It's harsh but she stopped doing it anymore.

She’s a retired old lady that just want to sit on the porch not make small talk with people. I’ve explained this to my wife before and told my mothers story.We had a little get together at my moms house. My mom doesn’t like it when people bring food, she works all day to make a spread and it’s like her thing. She just wants to provide for the guests. My wife came from work and she brought food, potatoes salad. I stop her from bringing it in, the whole night she is just bothering her when she was on the porch. Asking her if she wants to go on a shopping trip, when my mom asks for some quiet she still talks on. When I was walking by she asked me to take my wife away from her. This made my wife upset but I did it since I could see mom was getting close to the end of her rope.We had a talk in the care what that was all about, and she just wants to be loved by her MIL.  She is being nice so she doesn’t get why she doesn’t like her. I told her my mother will never love her and to just stop.

She called me a jerk and hasn’t spoken to me since.Edit was told to include this comment, from an info commentAlmost never, most of the time if people join her on the porch it’s very littler small talk or just join her watching the garden. She doesn’t care how loud they are in the house or anything like that. She likes watching others have a good time, more of an observer than anythingShe asked for quiet with my wife since she was just going on for a while.

She's seen a few episodes of my favorite shows, but she's not into anime; she does like cosplay, though, and she works seasonally as an SFX artist at a haunted house near us.

She got very excited and said I was going to love her costume, so I'll admit I thought she was going to do something sexy for me.Well, not exactly. The day of the convention comes, and she showed up at my house cosplaying Dabi from MHA- specifically a look he has later in the manga. It's a long white coat over white pants, no shirt. Her entire chest was exposed and she'd obviously spent hours applying burn makeup; she has short hair that she dyes constantly, this time she bleached it white and dyed a few red streaks.I wasn't expecting her to show up without a shirt. Her burn scar makeup only covered half her chest, so you could clearly see her mastectomy scar. It wasn't a verry attractive costume, especially since she'd gone all out with the scars and made them look raised and kind of realistic.We went to the con, and while a lot of people came up to take photos with her, I noticed several others looking at her chest. That evening, she said I'd been quiet all day, and I honestly told her I was a little embarrassed that she was flaunting her mastectomy scar like that.

	"title" : "AITA for charging my friends rent then keeping the money for myself?",
	"body" : "This will be my first year in college. When I got accepted, the 1st person I told was my uncle. We’re very close because he took care of me when I was little because of my parent’s crazy work schedules. Anyway, my grades were good enough to get me in but not enough to get me any scholarships. That means I’ll have to take out loans for tuition and work for my expenses. When my uncle found out, he said I should just concentrate on school instead of working but my dad (his brother) said that money is tight right now so my parents can’t help me out as much as they want to. My uncle has investment properties all over the place so he said it’s not a big deal for him to buy another one near my campus, which he did. Then he had contractors renovate the house so emerging in there is brand new. He even had them install a bay window in the master bedroom just for me and I got to pick out everything else like the carpet and counters. He told me he wants me to concentrate on school and not work. Instead, I can be his landlady and rent out the other 3 bedrooms and keep that money to fund my expenses.I have a group of friends who are attending the same school so I made a deal with them. Studio apartments are going between $900-1500 (not including utilities) around the campus with the expensive ones being closer. My uncle’s house is one street over from campus so I can literally walk to class everyday. I’m charging my friends $700 per room or if they double up, $350 per person per month and split utilities evenly. They all jumped at the offer and no one asked any questions until recently when one of them asked me how much the overall rent was. I was honest and told them about my uncle and our deal. That blew up in my face because now everyone of my friends are calling me greedy for charging them rent then pocketing the money. We’re all in a huge fight and they all want to either pay nothing or “throw a couple hundred” in for utilities.I cried to my uncle but he said now that I’m an adult, I need to make my own adult decision. He’ll stand by my decision. I don’t want to lose my friends but I don’t want to disappoint my family with bad grades either. I thought I was being fair with rent but literally all of my friends are calling me a greedy AH.Update:Thank you for reading my post and giving me advice. I went to my uncle, this time without crying, and told him some of the advice given on here and asked him for his advice. This time he didn’t tell me to make my own adult decisions and told me he was waiting for this conversation. This is what we agreed to do.I texted all of my friends (former?) and told them because of the arguments and hurt feelings, we can no longer live together. My uncle offered to work out a lease for me in the beginning but I refused because these were my friends. Because no one signed a lease, we didn’t have to break any. I was worried about them suing but my uncle said that the law in our state requires anything to do with real estate be in writing. Unlike other situations, real estate deals cannot be oral so I’m good. This time I took him up on the offer of creating a lease for me to have new tenants sign.We spent the morning researching rent prices and making ads. My friends and I made the agreement at the beginning of summer. Now that there’s only a couple of weeks left until school starts, we found almost nothing within 3 miles of campus. There were some options further out but nothing was cheaper than $1,200 for a shared room and that was in an old house with window A/C units and 5 miles from campus. When the house was being renovated, my uncle had central air and heating installed. We came to a rent price of $1,300 and placed ads in several places including FB. Within an hour, I got a dozen messages. It’s 4 pm now and I literally have over 100 messages. Many of them don’t even need to see the house in person. Based off of the pictures and location, they want to submit their application today. Some even offered to send me the deposit and 1 person said her dad will pay me the full semester amount today.My uncle gave me some advice that was exactly what you guys said. Never mix money with friends or I might lose both and never tell anybody my business. He told me not to lie, just keep quiet.Thanks again and have a great weekend you wonderful people!",

He kept saying that he would but he never did.I was in the shower yesterday and I heard him scream. I rinsed off and went to see if he was okay.The spring caught him in the nuts.I couldn't help it.  I giggled. It was sort of funny.He thinks I'm an asshole for laughing at his \"suffering\". I told him that he didn't care that much when it was my legs getting it.AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for announcing my preganacy at my sister's wedding?",
	"body" : "I'm 32, my sister is 28, and we've always been incredibly close. Point in case, she was the first person I told that I was pregnant, besides my husband of course. I told her essentially a week after I got a positive pregnancy test, which was about 3 months before her wedding.I told her that I was going to tell our parents and my husband's parents around the 10 week mark, but she told me that I should hold off until her wedding in September. I'd be like 4 months along at that point, so I wouldn't be showing really, and she thought it would be so special for her to be able to make an announcement about a \"special guest\" at her wedding and it be her first niece or nephew, and my parents first grandbaby. I agreed, because it seemed like it meant a lot to her and, again, we were super close and I was happy to do that for her!Turns out, the first trimester was awful with morning sickness and exhaustion - I would have preferred to be able to talk about it with my mom, but I was willing to grin and bear it for my sister's wedding.Well, the wedding came along, and about halfway through the night, I asked her when the announcement was happening. She told me that she had changed her mind and that her wedding didn't seem like a good time or place to announce my pregnancy. I was obviously super upset since I went through a really awful first trimester with only my sister and husband to lean on. I decided I wasn't going to put the announcement on hold any longer just for her, so my husband and I pulled my parents aside and quietly told them, and told them to keep it private for the evening. They were thrilled, lots of hugs, a few tears, but a very touching and private moment. Literally no one else found out until I announced it on Facebook a week later.My sister found out around the same time as my Facebook post when my dad mentioned how we told him about it, and she texted me and called me a bitch who made her wedding about myself, and she hasn't spoken to me since. I've messaged her and apologized probably a dozen times since then, but she refuses to talk to me, and now she refuses to come see her little nephew who is almost a month old at this point.My parents and partner think I did nothing wrong since she went back on her word, and that I should just wait it out and she'll come around. I'm obviously unsure as clearly this has made her so upset with me, and we were so close before. AITA?EDIT: I've seen a lot of comments saying that I was trying to be petty, mean, vindictive, spiteful, hurt my sister, etc. and I just wanted to address that really quickly. If I had been any of those things, I would have made sure she found out that I had done it, you know? She just happened to find out a week later because my dad let it slip. I just desperately wanted to tell my mom, and after waiting over two months for my sister, it really felt like I couldn't wait another moment at the whims of someone who wasn't even involved in the pregnancy. I understand now though that I definitely should not have waited to tell my mom about the pregnancy. Hindsight is 20/20 and all that.",

	"title" : "AITA for kicking out my pregnant teenage step daughter over my cat",
	"body" : "I’m at the vet waiting room with my cat so I’m gonna rush this and edit the grammar laterSo I (35f) have been with my (45m) fiancé for 3 years now he has two kids a daughter (22) who’s a lovely girl and other daughter (19) who I’ll call Kim for the sake of the post. Kim has always had a bad attitude to everyone especially me now before anyone assumes my fiancé was already divorced his ex 2 years before we even met and his ex is a nice person who I get along with very well so there’s no hate from her end ether.Kim is 3 months pregnant and living with us because we have more room for her and the baby, the baby daddy stays sometimes but he has two jobs along with studies so it’s mainly been me who’s take care of her.So the main issue today her boyfriend came over so my fiancé  suggested we let them have the house to themselves and go for a walk, about two hours later I came home and noticed my cat missing who Kim hated and wanted me to get rid of. I asked her were he was Kim said she ran out the door which I knew was bullshit whiskey is an elderly cat who even  wouldn’t go out on the porch if I didn’t bring him. So I checked the ring camera and as expected Kim threw whiskey out that ran her off. My fiancé tried saying kim is pregnant her hormones are all over the place and pregnancy brain messes with women that he was gonna bring up getting rid of whiskey for the baby sake anyway.I was in tears till I looked over at kim with a smug satisfied look on her face I fucking lost it. I got up in her face and scream that she had one hour to find my cat or all her shit would be in the dumpster and I was done being her slave.She said she wasn’t looking for my stupid cat and back off as she was pregnant, my fiancé told me to claim down and we’d look for the catI told him no I would look for my cat and when I got back his daughter better be gone and if he has issues he could go too because I was sick of dealing with his little bitch of daughter who everyone including her own parents and boyfriend avoids,I didn’t wait for them to respond I did hear her crying tho, as you know I found my cat he was hiding in some bushes it took 20 long minutes to find himWhen I arrived home they were both in the living room my fiancé said he wanted to talk but first he said I owed Kim an apology. I told him fuck himself and she better start packingShe’s at her boyfriends family home as far as I know  and my fiancé is not talking to meUpdate I didn’t think I’d give at least this soonSo my now ex fiancé oldest daughter reached out to me to ask my side I’ll call her Kate she’s a animal lover like my self. Her father asked to stay with her for a few nights because he said I was having a break down over my cat he basically made out the cat escaped and I went after “pOoR” Kim for not trying to catch him her condition. Kate is a very smart girl she can see bull shit form a mile away and obviously she knows her own sister so she called Kim to ask her side. Kim was more honest basically her and her dad planned it as some of you suggested the plan was for her baby daddy to take the cat out a road dump but he wouldn’t do it because in Kim’s words he was a “pussy” so they got in a fight about it and Kim thankfully being lazy just kicked whiskey out and ran him out of the yard. Kate told me the way Kim’s talking about me and whiskey even if she doesn’t move back she do something for revenge to whiskey.  so I’ve decided to listen to Kate,my friends, the vet, his assistant and everyone here and I called off the wedding which is in few weeks and broke up with my ex fiancé by text I don’t give a fk if it’s immature or cruel I’ve told him I’ll box up his stuff for him and leave it for him to collect in a few days. Don’t worry about whiskey I told my ex call me when he’s coming over so he’ll be locked in a room safe and I’m calling a 24 hour lock smith nextThe begging and bullshit promises have already started  but my minds made up I’m done being his ATM slave for him and his spoiled bitch of a daughter (Kim)Whiskey is fine btw just a little shaken but he’s curled up in my lap refusing to move",

	"title" : "AITA for telling my wife it is time she went back to work?",
	"body" : "Throwaway account my wife follows my main.My wife has been out of work since 2018, she had a mental break down during her fifth year of teaching. She has been going to therapy since, and we started marriage counseling during Covid. Reason for marriage counseling was because she thought I was pushing her too hard to go back to work before her and her therapist thought she was ready. I tried to explain many times that was not my intent but realistically speaking for me to keep up with expenses, and retirement contributions I pretty much have to take on extra shifts which sometimes clock in over 18 hours a day, and on average I have been pulling 84 hour weeks. I have been doing this since she stopped working.We recently had a fight cause I had an extremely rough week and had the conversation again about her going back to work. She opened up with the same line she always does \"We do not feel it is the right time yet, she feels I have made great progress and if I rush it I run the risk of losing it.\" The we being her and therapist. I told her I really do not give a fuck what her therapist has to say, and I am sick of you hiding behind her words whenever this topic comes up.She started to cry, telling me she does not like being this way either and I am belittling her due to suffering from mental health issues. I replied saying I do not indeed to belittle you or not take your issues seriously problem is I am running myself ragged, and what happens if I have a mental break? Do you think I will have the luxury of not working? No, I will have to push through my demons.She said her therapist warned her this would happen sooner or later I would try to manipulate her into doing something she was not ready to do. This is when I really lost it and just let it all out. I did not say anything kind. I told her she insults me for thinking what I am doing is manipulation. I told her I am working these extra shifts so she can be home and bullshit playing games. I told during this entire time you have not even made an effort to improve on certain skills, I told her she can still not cook to save her life, and that was sick of coming home after 12 or 18 hour days just make us dinner cause her idea of making dinner is pretty a pre-made in the oven or ordering out. Among other things, that said she stormed out the house crying yelling and shouting how I am a piece of shit, and rather see myself comfortable verse her getting better.So here I am, I do not feel at the core I am wrong, and while what I said was harsh I think it did have to be said. So reddit was I the asahole here?Hey I appreciate the replies, going to leave a quick update to answer and clarify what I can. I apologize if I miss something. Thank nonetheless.Yes, I have been to a couple of sessions with my wife and her therapist. Tbh it largely felt I was getting ganged up on. My wife brought up how I was always tired, so I explained I am working harder to maintain our home. When I suggested part time work would allow me to work less, their counter suggestion was to cut things like saving for retirement, and hold off on paying off debt, and tackle such things after my wife gets better. Then I suggest renting out the house to cover the mortgage and we downsize to an apartment. Her therapist said such a drastic change to her environment could have a negative impact on her depression, and advises against such major life changing events.During another session she brought up how my suggestion she tries cooking to save is money so we do not order so much. She felt insulted because in terms of money coming in I am making slightly more then our combined income, and she was able to cover her expenses so she does not understand why we are having such a hard time. I was honest, it has less to do with money per-se and more so the fact the amount of hours I have to work to maintain the income. I told her I pretty much am working two fulltime jobs. The cooking or doing things around the house was dropped fairly quickly and became a critic on how i cannot mange money since I am making more, yet I never had issues when she was working with how she spent.More or less every session became what I could do to help my wife, and I get it her therapist has to look out for my wife and generally my concerns are small compared to my wife's. My wife is not a huge fan of our marriage counselor because she offers suggestions that go against her therapist.My friend has also suggested I speak with a lawyer to see exactly what my options are. After reading many of the comments and thinking back on everything I think I am going to do that. I love my wife and I know she is sick but I am good to no one if i keep up this pace.Final Edit:Thank you so much for the replies and advice, was a slow morning only had one field call so I was looking over the thread with a colleague and close friend. After talking I have decided to put in a request for two weeks vacation. During that time I am going to relax with my friends play some Baldurs Gate 3 and also get my shit together. Going to speak with a lawyer and see what my options are cause I was young and dumb and much of her debt is mine because I cosigned and have a joint account. I will go to the doctor for the first time in four years and make sense everything is still working as it should. During this time my friend said I could crash at their place, so I am going to take him up on that offer.This will be my final post here though, going over this I made this post for all the wrong reasons. This is something that should not have been posted publicly and I was petty for that. Even so, I thank everyone because a lot of what was said was what I needed to hear. I do not have much in terms of a family both my parents passed. Thanks for the tough love. Something has to change, and if my wife is unable I have to do it. I am young, I should be enjoying my life I am not even 30 yet as my friend said. I aged so much in these last five years, it is scary my friend showed me pictures from before all this happened. I want to go back to the person I was then.I agree I was the asshole for what I said, but I do not regret it it was a wake-up call I needed.",

We have a big farm house so it's not big deal but SIL is very opinionated.My SIL and my husband have different fathers. Her dad died from liver failure 10 years ago and his death date just past by not too long ago. He was a massive alcoholic and due to this, my SIL turns in to a bitch whenever she sees anyone drinking, especially people in her family. Well, my husband (who isn't a big drinker) went out with friends last night as kind of a last \"hoo-ra\" because we will be welcoming our first daughter in to this world in about a month and he just wanted to celebrate his becoming of a dad. I encouraged him to go. I arranged for his Uber back home and he came in around 11pm last night. He was very drunk. He walked in the door singing \"Let's Stay Together\" by Al Green, dancing, spinning me around the living room floor in some very sloppy waltz and laughing the whole time as he was tripping all over himself.Now, my dad is an alcoholic too. So I get it, but honestly, I was having a fucking blast with my drunk husband. SIL comes in to the room and just starts laying in to my husband about him drinking. Screaming about how he was going to turn out \"just like dad\", etc etc. At this point my husband's mood is dead. He's crying. I lost it. I told her \"how he can he turn out like a POS when that POS isn't HIS father? Get out of my house right now and don't ever come back.\" She immediately went quiet and said she couldn't take her daughter out at this time of night and that no hotels had vacancy and my husband \"knew better\" than to drink around her and I told her that's not my problem. Leave. The whole family is pissed at me and my husband right now for both him drinking in front of SIL and me kicking them out at midnight.

	"body" : "My girlfriend is an incredibly picky eater. Like I said in my title, she eats like she is 10 years old. In fact I'll give a short list of things she refuses to eat; Unflavored water, fish (excluding fried shrimp), anything with bones, cheese other than sharp cheddar, spinach, onions, garlic, pasta without red sauce, eggs, spicy food, aioli, ketchup, potatoes (other than french fries), pastries with fruit, citrus, sausage or any \"non-American\" food. This compares to me, someone who grew up in multiple different regions of the US and lived in abroad for a few years, so I'm a bit more adventurous when it comes to food.Whenever me and my girlfriend go out somewhere nice she ends up getting the same meals usually either a burger or chicken tenders and fries. We could be going to an authentic Nepalese restaurant and she will get the french fries and white rice. To me it's kind of embarrassing to go to a restaurant where there is a dress code and for her to order chicken tenders and fries. It especially bothers me that since I typically pay, I end up paying 15 bucks for chicken tenders that I could get from the freezer section at Walmart for 5 bucks.Recently in our area a very nice dinner place opened up and my girlfriend has been dying to go. I took a look at the place and the menu and saw that it looked nice but the food was kind of pricy. She said she was probably gonna get chicken tenders as per usual. I asked her what's the point of going then if I can toss some tenders in the air fryer for her and not spend a ridiculous amount of money on it.She asked why I had an attitude about this and I told her that I thought it was a waste of time and money to go to a nice place to get little kid food. She interpreted this as me calling her a little kid. I clarified that I wasn't calling her a child, however it is kinda childish for her to eat the way she does. I also said that if she's gonna order food we can make at home theres not aby point in us going anywhere.This lead to an argument about me thinking I'm better than her.Aita?",

	"body" : "My boyfriend and I are staying at his parents’ house. It’s been going really well, but his dad is very particular. He has moments every day where he corrects or instructs the other people in the house on how he wants us to behave. I don’t really have a problem with it, but he has a few rules that do make me a little uncomfortable.I don’t need to get into why, but I always get diarrhea here. I’ve been visiting them a few times a year for almost a decade and it just is what it is. My boyfriend and I used to stay in a room downstairs with a bathroom and it wasn’t a problem, but his brother moved back home and now we don’t have our own bathroom.I don’t want to advertise the fact that I have diarrhea to everyone in the house and I’m not allowed to use the bathroom fan at night, so I usually use Poo-Pourri or Just a Drop. When we got home the last time, my boyfriend got a text from his dad asking him to ask me to stop using “strong essential oils” as it was making him feel sick. I was so embarrassed and I honestly have been kind of dreading coming here again.I was talking to my mom about this and she suggested that I bring some paper matches because that’s what she used to do. I got some paper matches and they actually work pretty well.Tonight I woke up from my sleep because I had diarrhea. I lit a match when I was done, ran it under water and folded it up into some aluminum before throwing it in the garbage. I fell back asleep and was woken up a while later by a big commotion. My boyfriend’s dad smelled burning and thought the house was on fire so he woke everyone up in a panic and searched the house to see what was burning.I didn’t immediately equate a match with a house fire and I didn’t smell anything when I woke up so I didn’t bring up that I had lit a match. It wasn’t even clicking for me that the match was what he smelled until my boyfriend asked me if I smelled anything when I got up earlier to use the bathroom.Long story short, I just got chewed out by his dad for “lighting matches at night or lighting matches in general as a guest in their home” and even his mom was upset because I could have “started a fire” and “nobody would know”. I apologized and everyone went back to bed but then my boyfriend lectured me for like 15 mins about “embarrassing him” and “playing dumb” about not knowing what his dad smelled and not using “common sense” and then he told me to “go to sleep” and “try not to wake everyone up again”.I’m honestly so pissed. My boyfriend is sleeping soundly and I’m just laying here getting madder and madder. I want to wake him up so we can leave because I feel so uncomfortable. I really don’t want to face everyone in the morning. I don’t feel like I did anything wrong, but I don’t know if I’m thinking rationally because I’m tired and I can’t fall back asleep.

	"body" : "*I DO NOT GIVE PERMISSION FOR THIS POST TO BE SHARED OUTSIDE OF REDDIT *  So some ladies in our church occasionally send out invites for \"meal trains\" for people to sign up to bring meals for someone who recently had a baby or is sick or something like that. I get it. It's a nice idea to help people out. I have no problem and have participated sometimes in the past.Last week a meal train was posted for a lady named \"Sue\" (name changed obviously) who apparently had spent a few days in the hospital due to severe back pain. She's home now but still in pain and unable to do much. The meal signup stated about bringing a meal for 3 people. Sue lives with her husband and adult son. The husband and son work full time. Sue does not work.I decided not to sign up for this meal train because I also work full time. I figured if people want to, that's fine, but I don't have extra time to be cooking meals for people who have capable adults in the household to help out. Some people do have extra time, and that's great if they want to help out. Well, I'm guessing others felt this way too because the meal train just wasn't filling up very fast so they kept posting about it and posting about it. I kept ignoring it.Last night I got a call from a friend of Sue's. We'll call her Jane. Jane asked if I was aware that Sue had been in the hospital and if I could possibly sign up for a meal slot. I explained very nicely to Jane that I work full time and I don't often have time to make a full meal and that my husband and I usually just get our own meals or one of us cooks when we're able. She was like, \"Oh well that's ok. There are plenty of weekend slots availble too that you could sign up for when you're not working.\" I said, \"Well, aren't her husband and son home on the weekends? Couldn't they cook then?\" Jane got really snippy with me then and cut the conversation short. I told my husband about it and he thinks that I could have made time on the weekend to cook something and take it over just to be nice. I asked him why didn't he sign up then if he thought the needed meals on the weekend and he told me I was just trying to start an argument.I don't think I'm the AH because Sue's husband and grown son should be perfectly capable of cooking for Sue and themselves, especially on the weekend. But I might be the AH because I don't have much going on during the weekends and I COULD cook for them. I just don't see the need to.So.........reddit.......AITA?",

	"title" : "Update: AITA for setting boundaries with my stepson",
	"body" : "Original postA little bit more than a year ago, I asked for advice on how to deal with my stepson. I was ripped to shreds in the comments, and deservedly so. For those who haven’t read the post: I didn’t feel like my stepson was respecting my authority after I imposed overly strict rules upon him.I’ve had a few people ask for an update, but first, I wanted to clear up one thing. Many people assumed that I took an under privileged kid and put him in a school full of rich kids. That couldn’t be further from the truth. Before we married, he and his mother were very well off. We both have really well paying jobs, the only reason he was in a public school was because the schools in our area are really great. The only reason he was switched to the private school is because it is a STEM school and I thought that would be beneficial to him.Now on to the update. After reading the comments telling me how horrible of a stepfather I was, I felt sick. This may seem unbelievable but I was genuinely trying to do right by him and I was beside myself realizing that I did more harm than good. My stepson never knew his father, and I jumped at the chance to have that special father/son bond with him. I eased up on many of the restrictions I placed, he no longer has to surrender his phone and while we still do have family time, it’s about once a week instead of every night. He no longer has a bedtime and while his mom follows him on his socials (I do not) I no longer demand this passwords to anything. The only time I have asked him to babysit is in the case of an emergency but surprisingly, now that I’ve stopped, he’s been offering to babysit every once in a while.As for the school issue, he is still at the school we switched him too. We had many long talks about this very issue and he ultimately decided to finish out his high school career at the school because, while he missed his friends, he was able to recognize that this new school offered him the best opportunity to get into the college he really wants to attend.Since all of this, the relationship between my stepson and myself has drastically improved. For his 17th birthday we offered to get him a car and he and I had a really nice time picking out the right one. I’ve taken him to a few basketball games which he loves (and I’ve enjoyed learning about the sport from him). He actually got a girlfriend and came to me for advice about dating which is not something that would have happened before.I will say this, I am blessed with an incredibly smart, kind and compassionate stepson; Other kids may not have been so forgiving, and rightfully so. I urge other stepparents out there to really listen to their stepchildren instead of automatically trying to take over, you may not be as lucky as I was.",

I wear my traditional wear, which is really beautiful and obviously not German. The garment is green, so np problem there. Or so I thought.

I congratulate her and thank her for including me and I get a tight  in response.I keep to the edges of the room as the music isn't really my vibe, and I'm just observing how European weddings work. I leave around 8 (after 5 hours) and go home before the wedding finishes.Monday I walked into whispers in the office, people actually strangely and more reserved than usual. An office friend pulls me aside and fills me in: brides mother is fuming. My outfit was too extravagant, OTT and inappropriate. I drew attention from the bride and commandeered the room: I was rude and disrespectful. She's told people all about it, apparently.I approach MOB and ask to speak but she says she has nothing to say to me. I ask her why she has sth tk say everyone else about me but not to me, and she calls me an insolent child. I explain to anyone who scolds me that this was my first white people wedding: I specifically asked what to do wear and followed the guidelines. Where I'm from, there's no such thing as outshines g the bride - weddings are a fashion show and a chance to wear your best and brightest clothes. They told me this isn't africa (which was racially coded) nd people here have manners. I laughed and told that person to go to hell, so she's telling people I lack remorse for my behaviour.I'm wondering if I really am the asshole though?Edit: the dress inspo I showed to my tailor is now on my profile to help you.Edit 2:I'm about to board a flight. Someone told me to go back to my country so I'm doing just that Thanks for the feedback. I'm guessing not the asshole but could have inquired further/done research - fair.Some of yall are so pressed about the WP wedding - it literally means it's the first wedding I've been to where the bride, groom, and wedding party are white. It's really not that deep.Thanks for the engagement and see ya ",

	"body" : "My brother is getting married in a few months and his future wife recently asked me to be a part of her bridal party. I was thrilled and excited to be included, but then she informed me that the dress code for the bridal party was gender-specific, with women expected to wear dresses and men expected to wear suits. As someone who identifies as non-binary and is more masculine presenting, I am uncomfortable with conforming to a gender binary that doesn't accurately represent me. I brought this up with my brother and his fiancé, but they insisted that they wanted all their guests to adhere to the dress code, regardless of how it made them feel.I ultimately decided that I did not want to attend the wedding, as I did not feel comfortable being pressured to conform to a gender binary that doesn't accurately represent me. My brother and his fiancé are now upset with me, accusing me of being difficult and not willing to compromise.After a fight with them, I found out they went behind my back and involved my mom. She called me yesterday and told me I can put aside my identity for one day to make the day special for my little brother.I now feel bad and didn't realize something as small as the clothes I feel comfortable wearing would cause a rift within my family.So AITA for refusing to go to the wedding?",

	"body" : "My family is very well educated and full of professionals including several doctors, surgeons, dentists, etc. I have a good career and make a good living.When I met my fiancé, he was at my house to supervise a roofing crew the insurance company hired to replace my damaged roof. I instantly fell for him when he pulled up in his truck and couldn’t keep my eyes off of him for the rest of the day as he gave orders to his men. When we started dating, he was vague about his job and I just chalked it up to him being insecure about me having a better career. I didn’t care about our income imbalance. When we got serious, we talked about our future plans and that was when he told me the full extent of his little construction company. I was shocked that his construction earnings is as much as my dad’s surgeon salary. Gradually he took me around to the handful of construction lots and shopping centers he owns. His rental income combined with his construction earnings is double that of my dad’s. He said that few people know about his finances and he expects me to keep what I know to myself.My parents disapproved of him since the 1st time I brought him home. My dad coined the term “tool boy” and the rest of my family joined in whenever they talk behind my fiancé’s back. They don’t call him that to his face but instead make snide remarks. Once my mom said during dinner that they’re thinking about hiring someone to mow their lawn then turned to my fiancé and asked him what he charges. I always try to defend him and it’s a constant battle. It’s gotten worse since we’re planning our wedding and the other day my nerves just broke. Yesterday parents were trying to get me into getting a prenuptial then my dad said, “you have to protect your assets just in case tool boy decides to go slumming.”I lost it and yelled at my parents. During our shouting, I blurted out his earnings and that he makes more than both of them combined then I stormed out. I told my fiancé what happened but instead of supporting me, he got mad that I told his parents that. I argued that I was defending him then we got into an argument.My parents and family are mad at me for keeping secrets. My fiancé is mad at me for not keeping secrets.

	"body" : "My best friend lost a parent a year and a half ago which led him to a mental health crisis. Our friend group has been picking up the pieces ever since. He's doing much better now that he's in therapy, but he's definitely gone through it.What has complicated matters worse is my fiancée. It goes without saying that I love her, but she is the definition of a busybody sometimes. My best friend is a very private person. She knows something happened with him, but she doesn't know the details of what that something is. She probably never will. But because she's around me and my friends often as my fiancée and I live in the same house, she hears bits and pieces of the story and presses for more information.I try to circumvent this as best as I can - for example, I step out of the room for specific phone conversations. But still, it's hard to limit the discussion about it sometimes. If it’s necessary we bring it up and she’s around in person, we’ll refer to the 'Nolan situation' without giving specifics.Nolan will also stop by my place at night when he can't sleep. This doesn't happen all that often - maybe twice a month. He'll text me or call me saying he's outside, I'll go sit with him and maybe smoke a little bit, then he'll head home. I'll wait up until I know he got home safely, then I go back to sleep. My fiancée hates this. She claims the phone calls always wake her up - they don't, she just sometimes happen to wake up for the bathroom while I'm outside - and that me not being in bed is alarming.This brings us to last night. Nolan stopped by and when I came back inside, my fiancée said she was 'putting a stop to it.' She said all the sneaking around is making her paranoid, she doesn't feel like she can properly trust me or be a part of my friend group without knowing the details, and that Nolan needs to stop relying on me so much. I told her that no matter whether we're married, dating, whatever, she will never have any ownership over my friend's trauma, and that she was never going to be able to order me around in regards to it. I also said her comfort was less important than someone’s actual physical well-being. She was obviously hurt by this and went to stay with her mom after work today.AITA?EDIT: She knows Nolan lost a parent, she doesn’t know the aftermath beyond the statement he had a mental health crisis. Yes, he has specifically asked me not to tell her. EDIT 2: This is not something we talk about “constantly” in front of her. I’m giving examples that have happened over the past year and a half. Also, Nolan sees a therapist. He comes to my place to hang out.",

	"title" : "AITA for wanting my sister to pay me back because my nephew lost my electric scooter?",
	"body" : "Last year I bought an EMOVE Cruiser electric scooter which I’ve since modified to add more speed, a new handlebar and some other mods. The scooter itself was not cheap, at $1500, plus mods puts it over $2000.I have a sister(43f) and a nephew(13m) who I always let housesit for me while I’m out of town on business. I have pets and plants that I need taken care of and they always welcome a change of scenery. So I had to go on a business trip last month for a week and let them house sit. My nephew has always asked me about my scooter and I told him that it isn’t for kids because it’s extremely fast and I’ve expressly  forbidden him from riding it multiple times. His mother knows about this as well.Well, I come back from my trip and my sister tells me that I’m going to be mad, but my nephew took my scooter out, left it unattended and had it stolen. I was fucking pissed and asked them to leave.I told them they’d have to replace it and my sister pleaded with me, they couldn’t afford it, it was a mistake and that he could do just do chores around my house to pay me back. I told her that it doesn’t replace my scooter. She said that any money would have to come from their vacation fund. I said, tough shit.Our parents have gotten involved and said that I’m taking it too far. They agree that my nephew should be punished and I should be paid back, but to take away their family vacation is just cruel and petty. They suggested a payment plan. I told them, hell no, that I use my scooter to commute to work often and that I wanted it back immediately. Furthermore, he was warned not to ride it since it’s dangerous.Now that I’ve started to calm down here a little, I wonder if I’m being an Ahole here by being so demanding and potentially punishing everyone else for my nephew’s mistake.Edit:Hey reddit, I went to sleep last night and didn't expect this to get so popular, so thanks.Now to clear a few things up: People are taking offense to the verbiage \"let\" in my OP. Okay, let me explain, my sister and nephew view housesitting as a mini-vacation. I've offered money every time to them do the job, but they refuse, so I give them free run of the house and money for meals.I had insurance on it, but they won't do anything without a police report. My sister did not file one, she didn't think the police would accept the report because it wasn't a car or some nonsense like that.And no, I won't be filling a report with the police over my nephew. Listen I'm furious at him and my sister, but I'm not going to get him into legal trouble over this. He needs to be taught a harsh lesson, but jail time and a record isn't one of them. At least, not in this instance.That being said I'm going to take some time, and think of an appropriate and harsh punishment for my nephew. I'll probably ending up accepting the payment plan, but insist on interest. It's not about the money, it's about the principle.That should be all for now, thanks.",

I also work a physically intense outdoor job so I come home really sweaty and exhausted from the heat. The apartment will stay cool enough for me to fall asleep but then later on I’ll wake up in the middle of the night completely drenched in sweat. I’ll then get up and find out that my roommate has been switching the ac off while I’m sleeping. This really upsets me because it’s been making me really dehydrated and tired to begin with from not sleeping well and it’s been impacting my work.She’s unemployed right now so I thought she might’ve been hung up about the power bill. When I finally talked to her about it I explained that I’m already very sensitive to heat to begin with and that because we’re fortunate enough to have ac I want to enjoy it when I get home especially after a long day at work, and that the heat is causing problems for me. I even offered to foot some of her share of the power bill if she was really that concerned about it. But then she said that she turns it off because the apartment gets too cold (I should add that our AC is set at 70 and has never been moved lower than that).I told her that she should just use some blankets or put a sweater on if it was really bothering her, because the heat is unbearable. She then countered by saying that because she’s in recovery from anorexia she’s really sensitive to cold and that I’m not prioritizing her needs. I then responded by saying, “I’m sympathetic to your situation, but that is your problem and not mine, and it is starting to have a negative impact on me and we need to find some middle ground here, because I can’t take off my skin when it gets too hot.” She then got extremely upset and angry and told me that I was being ableist and insensitive. I’m kind of bothered by this because I’ve also had struggles with eating disorders in the past. So am I the asshole here?(Additional info from a comment I made so it doesn’t get buried: I see a lot of people making the assumption that I’m completely unwilling to compromise with her or that I’m set on having it at 70. During our talk I offered to adjust the temperature but she wants it COMPLETELY off. Not adjusted. Off all the way. And that was what made me angry.)",

He would sometimes eat them if we were out at a restaurant and they came as part of his meal. But he never ate them when I cooked for him. Originally I thought that maybe my cooking was the problem so I asked him if he enjoyed my food and he told me he loves my cooking. On nights I didn’t cook for him, he ate exclusively frozen foods and never ate the vegetables in those either. Naturally, he has some health issues. Vitamin deficiencies etc. he had phrased it to me as if he was somehow just genetically unlucky. I believed it for a while bc idk how that stuff works but eventually it became clear to me it’s because he voluntarily eats a vegetable like once a month.6 months ago I started hiding vegetables in my cooking. If I was making pasta I’d put the vegetables in I’d usually put in for myself, then take half out and blend it so he wouldn’t notice the vegetable chunks and then tell him I’d just scooped the veg out of his portion. This happens more often now we live together because I do all of the cooking. He’s been telling me a lot lately he’s been feeling a lot better the past few months and has even had his doctor reduce the dosage of some of his medications and he hasn’t had to take his multivitamin in weeks. I kept my mouth shut because I’m just glad he’s feeling better and it really does me no harm to hide the veg in his food.Yesterday, I was making one of our regular pasta meals (it’s one that’s very easy to hide at least 4 veggies in) and i was about to blend my boyfriend’s portion when the blender died mid-blend. I had to serve it in all its veg chunk glory.  My boyfriend refused to eat the vegetables but when he tasted the sauce he said it’s weird how it tastes the exact same even though this one has veg in it. So, I confessed. He screamed at me and called me a controlling bitch and said that it’s none of my business if he thinks vegetables don’t do anything. I pointed out he said he felt better. He said his health was none of my business and that I’m a controlling, judgey AH and stormed out of our apartment to stay with his sister. His sister texted me to say he’s fine but she agrees with. him. My friends agree it’s ridiculos that he didn’t eat veg but agree I’m being an AH. AITA?",

	"body" : "As a wedding planner who has been in the industry for many years now, my (31M) party trick amongst close friends and family is being able to guess how long my clients' marriages will last with pretty alarming accuracy. If you ask anyone in the industry, there are specific indicators while working with a couple that allow us to be able to gauge compatibility. I can usually get down to around a six month window when predicting when photos of each other will disappear from socials.This is not me taking joy in crashing and burning of relationships. Working in this career field can actually leave you feeling jaded about relationships in general, which is why I'm reluctant to work for friends and family. The specific stress wedding planning puts on some people/couples can bring out the worst in them that you don't see in everyday life.My sister is getting married early next year and practically begged me to plan for her despite my stance on clients I know personally. I finally gave in and we began the process back in March.Last week, while we were meeting and finalizing a few things, she asked me about the party trick I mentioned. She said since I had been working with her and her fiancé for months now, I could give  my prediction as to how long they were going to last. I laughed and tried to move on. I thought she was joking, but she continued to press the issue. After her continually bothering me about this for at least 15 minutes when I'm trying to move on (I do have work outside of my specific appointment with her that I needed to get to), I finally told her I thought they would last forever. She claimed she didn't believe me and wanted my real number, so I shrugged and told her the truth: A year and a half.She was livid. I felt incredibly uncomfortable with the whole ordeal, especially with how little she respected my boundaries in what is supposed to be a professional setting, and just tried to usher her out of my office. Instead, she began ranting about my own marriage and said she gives us until the end of the year before we break up, and accused me of being a homewrecker.She finally left, and I emailed her saying I would no longer be involved in planning. I gave her the contact information for all of the vendors we were working with, but told her the venue would no longer be available as they only book to people they have existing relationships with and my involvement was necessary. I have had to \"break up\" with clients before, but this felt particularly rough.She is now told our parents that I am purposefully sabotaging her wedding, and that I was unforgivably rude to her when she just asked a playful question. I feel very silly for letting a person disrespect my boundaries over and over again, something I typically wouldn't tolerate, but now I'm wondering if I'm in the wrong.AITA?",

Enzo married his wife “Steph” (33f) two years ago. Steph has a daughter, “Alice” (4) with her ex but has sole custody, and Enzo and Steph have a 7mo son “Teddy”. I also have a 3 year old daughter.Enzo and Steph moved to the city I live in when Steph got pregnant, and since then, Steph developed a habit of showing up at my apartment building unannounced. It became a problem and I talked to both her and Enzo about it and she stopped, until she gave birth.Now, she regularly drops by unannounced to leave Alice at my building for “babysitting” while she has to run errands or something. She’s had her carpool drop Alice off at my apartment before. My poor housekeeper is a wonderful woman who has had to deal with Alice arriving unexpectedly while I’m out and I feel terrible about it. I’ve told the concierge not to let her up and to say no one is in but then I’ll arrive to Alice waiting in the lobby which is not safe and the concierge has told me I can’t make them responsible for a child. Steph keeps saying she only does it when she’s desperate but I don’t see how she can be that desperate to run errands at least twice a week and frankly I’m not a nanny if she’s desperate she needs to hire some help. I’ve spoken to Enzo and he is always extremely apologetic and says he will talk to her and I believe he does, but he also works during the day and can’t police where she is at all hours.I reached my breaking point a couple of days ago when I returned from lunch to find Alice at home, having been dropped off since she had a half day at school. I apologised profusely to my housekeeper who had spent time playing babysitter and called Steph, no answer. I called her several times, and then Enzo, who was on a business trip and distraught over the situation.Steph eventually turned up a couple of hours later and I went ballistic. I said if she ever leaves Alice at my building again I will call social services and I will call them every single time she drops Alice off with me until they do something, because this is not my job and she is an irresponsible and neglectful parent. She burst into tears and begged me to help out with Alice but I said no and reminded her I’d never said yes in the first place, she just kept dumping her kid here. Steph kept trying to guilt trip me but I was too exhausted and upset about the situation to be receptive and eventually my husband had to tell her to leave.I feel bad because as I said, Enzo has never been anything but the most accommodating person where I’m concerned and maybe treating his wife like that was harsh, but at the same time I chose to have one kid because I don’t want another one, Steph can’t use my house as a daycare.

My dad is rarely home and my mom is always busy with my brother so neither of them have time for me.I’ve known my best friend “Rachel” since we were in kindergarten. Her mom is the nicest person I’ve ever met. Rachel and I played soccer but my mom was rarely able to take me to practices and games so Rachel’s mom would always take me. I used to be in the school choir and my parents went to like one performance during the six years I did it. Rachel’s mom was at every performance for me even though Rachel wasn’t in choir.Those are just a few examples, but Rachel’s mom has always been there for me when my parents weren’t available. My mom never really cares what I’m doing unless she needs me to watch my brother so I spend a lot of time at Rachel’s house. Once I spent a whole weekend there and my mom didn’t even call to ask where I am. Rachel’s family go on a lot of vacations and they often take me.They’re going to Disney World during Thanksgiving break and invited me to come with them. I asked my dad and he said I could go. They’ve already planned and booked everything and I’m really excited. I’ve been to Disneyland once with my family and it was horrible. My brother threw a huge tantrum on the first day because he wanted to go on the rides alone and sit between mom and dad so I had to stay in the hotel most of the time.My brother found out that I’m going to Disney and he had a really big melt down. He loves Disney and he was mad that I was going without him. My mom told me that she was planning to go to Washington to visit my grandparents. My dad didn’t say anything about that so I’m pretty sure she just made that up to stop me from going. And even if they are going, I don’t want to. I don’t want to go on a fourteen hour car ride with my brother and I’m pretty sure when we get there they’re either going to make me stay with him while they go out or take him out and leave me alone in the hotel (I also wouldn’t be allowed to go out on my own).She told me that I need to think about my brother and his feelings are more important because he’s younger and autistic. I told her that I honestly don’t give a f*ck about my brother’s feelings and I wish he was never born. He was there when I said all this and he’s been crying and screaming for the last three hours and it’s giving me a headache. My mom has been trying to calm him down and my dad said that he’ll still let me go because he understands I’m frustrated (he also grew up with a neurodivergent siblings so he knows what it’s like). My mom said that I’m a rude, ungrateful brat and I need to be kinder to my brother. AITA?EDIT: Idk if this is important but we live in California and went to Disneyland in Anaheim. I’m going to Disney World in Orlando with Rachel’s family. I think my brother does somewhat understand that Disney World has more fun stuff which makes him more. mad. I didn’t tell him anything and I’m pretty sure my dad didn’t either, so either he overheard us talking or my mom told him.EDIT 2: I was 11 when the Disneyland incident happened. My brother was mostly nonverbal then but when we were about to leave the hotel he started screaming and saying no while pointing at me. My parents calmed him down briefly but when we got on our first ride he started screaming again so my parents told me to go back to the hotel. I snuck out the second day and went on like two rides before I ran into my parents and they told me to back because they didn’t want me to be out there alone.EDIT 3: I don’t blame my brother for what happened at Disneyland. He was four. I blame my parents for not finding a better way to handle the situation. He was nonverbal at that time but he can talk now. He isn’t high functioning exactly but he does understand what’s going on around him. He has basic life skills but can’t be on his own for very long.",

	"body" : "Backstory: (F20) have a Japanese name even though I am not ethnically Japanese (My mom is Korean & my dad is British). They met and fell in love while studying in Japan, and had me there after marrying. We lived there until I was 14 before moving to the States. This will be important later on.Today a group of my roommate's friends came over to study with her, and I happened to be in the living room when they arrived. They were introducing themselves to me and when I said my name (I have a pretty common Japanese girl name so it's pretty hard to be mistaken about the origin) and one of the girls made a disgusted face and laughed at me saying that was so dumb. She said that she was Japanese American and I was \"culturally appropriating her country as a white person.\"I tried to explain that I lived in Japan for a while and that was why but she kept insisting I was lying and that if I was telling the truth I would be able to speak the language. Since she put it like that I started talking to her in Japanese (Basically explaining where I lived there and asking which prefecture her parents were from, etc). She ends up stuttering through a sentence in an awkward manner before leaving in a huff.Later my roommate told me I embarassed her by \"pretending to be more Japanese than an actual Japanese person and appropriating the culture\" and her friend expected an apology. My rooommate doesn't think I did anything wrong but now I feel like of bad.AITA?",

I had this planned for Saturday, so a few days before, I asked a small local business if she could please make 12 cupcakes with pink and blue icing on top, and pink icing in the middle. She agreed and said they would be ready to collect Friday eveningthe plan was to pick the cakes up friday, invite friends and family over saturday and give some guests a cupcake which would reveal the gender. i only invited a few guests as my apartment is fairly small, and i didnt want to do a large gender reveal anyway, just something cute and fun, plus, everyone loves cupcakesSo friday evening came, the small business owner (Claire) gave me her address to collect the cakes from, said they would cost £25 and they are ready to collect whenever. i drove to her apartment and knocked on the door. she greeted me there with the box of cupcakes and they looked amazing. they were exactly how i imagined them and thanked her for them. she gave me the box, but just as she did, her large pet dog came running up to me, barking, and jumped at me, knocking the box of cupcakes all over the floorClaire apologised and shut the dog inside he was still barking and jumping at the door. She said it’s because he gets excited when people come and visit, but he wouldn’t have hurt me as he’s friendly. At this point i didn’t know the damage to the cupcakes as the box landed upside down, i picked it up and the cakes were ruined. the icing had smashed all over the box and some cakes had spilled out onto the groundClaire looked horrified as i understand she spent a few hours making them for me, she apologised and said she could remake them for free, but they wouldn’t be ready until Sunday. I said unfortunately im expecting my guests tomorrow and sunday is no good, as i already had other plans. i explained i wouldn’t be paying for these cupcakes as they were inedible and ruined by her dog. We agreed payment upon receiving the goods, and since i never received them, i wouldn’t be payingShe said that I should still pay as she had to buy ingredients for the cakes and the costs of eggs has gone up meaning she would be out of pocket. i said if she had control of her dog, then they wouldn’t of been dropped and im sorry but again, i wouldnt be payingi got in my car and left without the cupcakes. i still had guests attend on saturday, i announced the gender in person, rather than with some cupcakes but it was still nice spending time with my friends and family. my family were all happy, but my sister in law said i should of still paid for the cupcakes as she accepted it was her fault, and offered to remake them for mei personally don’t think i should of had to pay for them, but now im feeling slightly guilty as i understand it’s a small business and a loss of profit would affect her a lot harder than a larger businessAITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for purchasing my guy friend his dream birthday present and \"outshining\" his girlfriend in the process?",
	"body" : "My guy friend, \"Tom,\" has been one of my best friends since college. We're in our mid 20's now and are both currently in committed relationships with long term partners. I have never had feelings for Tom nor has he ever had feelings for me.Since college, Tom has been a huge watch fanatic. Two months ago, he was showing me this stunning vintage watch and made an off-handed comment about how he would die of joy if he somehow got his hands on one.Very coincidentally, I was in NYC a few weeks ago and stumbled upon this watch store that just so happened to have the exact one Tom wanted. It was expensive, I wont lie, at about $2,500, but I decided to get it for his 25th birthday (to me, it was basically fate lol). My boyfriend and I do very well financially so this was something that I could personally afford and wanted to buy for Tom, especially knowing how happy it'd make him.Tom has a tradition of hosting a dinner party at his place for his birthday and then following that up with cake and gift opening. I told him before the dinner that my gift was a huge surprise and asked if he could save it for last and he agreed. His girlfriend ends up going first and she gets him this gorgeous sweater that she crocheted for him and a book that he's been wanting, which I thought was super thoughtful and lovely. Last, it was my gift. When he opened it and saw what it was he literally screamed, hopped over a bunch of people, and squeezed me in this huge bear hug. I was SO happy to see him happy, it genuinely filled me with so much joy. He even got emotional and I saw him swipe a few tears. He also said that it was the \"best gift he'd ever received.\" The whole time, his girlfriend was only slightly smiling and stayed quiet.The next morning, I get a text from his girlfriend that essentially said that although she appreciated my thoughtful gift, she thought that it was a bit out of touch and lacking awareness. She admitted that Tom had also told her about the watch and she wanted to get it for him, but it was way out of her budget. She accused me of knowing this (I had NO idea) and still getting it to rub it in her face and to \"outshine\" her. She finished by saying how she felt like I had overstepped a boundary by getting the gift and would appreciate me not doing anything similar to it again in the future. I responded and told her that while I could see her POV, I was just trying to do a nice thing for a close friend of mine. I asked her, wouldn't you rather he gotten the gift and seen the happiness that it brought him than him not getting it at all? She responded that that happiness was \"only shared between [me] and Tom\" and no one else and that she felt hurt by my actions.Only my boyfriend knows about this and he's on my side. But thinking through it all again, I do see how I could've overstepped, but my boyfriend says that it's not my job to apologize for her insecurities. So AITA here?",

I've seen all of them maybe twice in the last year, and we all live in the same city. Every time someone asks to meet up and we finally find a date everyone is available, one of the moms always asks if they can bring their child, or children. Its usually 1 of 2 moms, as the third actually wants to have a kid free evening. And before anyone else can answer, the other mom says yes. All 3 moms have husbands who can watch their kids.

I hang out with them one on one, or in smaller groups instead.Well a few days ago we agreed to finally meet up. No one had asked about kids and we were having a bbq and wine night. We'll, who shows up with their 8 year old? Yep, one of the moms. I clearly didn't hide my annoyance and one of the girls asked me why. I just waved it off and 30 min later I excused myself and left. Said I didn't feel well. In those 30 min we hadn't had any \"adult talk\", we were just entertaining the kid. I would rather go home thsn do this for another 3-4 hours.After I left, I think they realised this was a pattern and I got text from most of the girls in the group.

We have a rental suite in our basement that we just use as a family area so we agreed to let them live there.  Because I'm paranoid I had them sign a lease.A few days ago my husband had an opportunity to do some consulting at his old work.  He loves doing it because it gets him out of the house and he gets to see his old coworkers and friends. It was short notice so we hadn't arranged babysitting. We asked his sister to watch our youngest for the day so he could go work and she agreed.She then delegated the task to her 13 year old son. Then she had her nap.The kid didn't want to disturb his mom during her nap so he banged on my door while I was working to change a diaper.  Fair enough, if I were a 13 year old boy I might not feel comfortable changing a baby girl.  I asked where his mom was and he said she was napping.  I woke her up and told her that she had agreed to watch her niece and to do so.I waited for my husband to get home and we discussed his family.

I said that I was basically the one supporting her and if she couldn't help then she had to give me money or leave.Some further informationNeither her nor her husband have jobs right now.

I met other people like me and discovered that, unlike high school, university isn't hell.I even met a guy.  We both work at the campus store.My little brother graduated last year and got into the same school. Rather than stay in dorms he convinced my parents to let him move in with me.Well they own it so I had no say.  I lasted one semester.  Since he had an off campus residence my apartment became party central.  I asked my parents to make him stop after talking to him didn't work. They said to loosen up. I think they know how to chang my personality.I talked to the university and was able to snag a rare single room in the mature student dorm. I don't have a lot of stuff so when we went home for Christmas I took what was really important to me.My boyfriend, first one ever by the way, look at me all social now, cleaned out my room and moved my stuff to student housing for me.When we drove back after New Year's I dropped off my brother and then went to my new place.  It isn't perfect. But it is pretty sweet.My parents called me and asked where I was. My brother had let them know I wasn't in the apartment. I told them where I was and why I was there.  They were upset that they spent all that money to help me and I did not appreciate it.  I said I did. Until they stuck me with my brother.Without me there he is having a blast. Good for him. He is also missing a lot of classes and has been fined for noise complaints by the condo board.  But that's not my problem.My parents are asking me to please move back in because my brother is in danger of being put on academic probation. I asked if I was allowed to bar him from having parties and stuff. He was part of the conversation and was upset that I was asking to be put in charge of him.  My parents said he was allowed some freedom and that as his big sister I should look out for him and not let him fail.I thanked them for the opportunity but declined. And he recently had a party that the cops had to shut down.  My parents are considering selling the apartment but it's kind of a crappy market right now I guess.I feel bad that they might lose money after doing something so awesome for me.

My girlfriend tagged along.My niece was counting the play money to pass out to everyone, and one of the other kids said something about how he wanted to be rich and get all the 500 dollar bills. My niece, out of nowhere, blurted out that she couldn't be rich because she's an n-word. I was totally taken aback, and asked her who told her that. Apparently, some bully at school said that to her on career day when they were sharing dream jobs, and she said she wanted to be a rich president.I told her that that wasn't true at all, and hugged her, and she started crying. Then, my girlfriend jumped in, and told my niece that it's really important to forgive the boy who said that because he probably wasn't trying to be mean and was just confused. I was totally shocked, and told her she needs to stop trying to justify what happened.She then tried to hush me, and started baby-talking my niece and said that she should also try to be nicer to all the kids at school, because \"kindness goes both ways.\" I was totally livid at this point, and pulled my girlfriend aside and quietly but angrily told her she \"needs to learn when to shut the fuck up.\" She started getting riled up at me and started rambling about how statistics are on her side (idk what the hell she meant, I wasn't really processing what she was saying,) but I told her to get out of my grandma's home, and just leave already (she drove me here in her car, and I was planning to hitch a ride home with my brother.)This morning, I got multiple calls from my girlfriend's sisters calling me an abusive and shitty prick.

We have her for four days a week (M-T) while she's at her dad's Fri-Sun.From the beginning, Jane told me Emily doesn't need a second father figure as she has her dad to fill that role. I was only supposed to be a trusted authority figure in case she ever needed anything. I didn't mind and try my best to respect that boundary. She's a sweet child anyway and doesn't cause trouble so it's not like I have to discipline her. Her father is also a good dad.Emily's dad recently got married and his wife has two kids of her own who are at their place Wednesday to Saturday and at their dads' Sunday to Tuesday. Emily and her new step-siblings don't get along at all. They're always fighting and it's pretty toxic.Emily's dad asked Jane if they change their custody schedule to match his step-kids' to keep the children apart. It's not a big deal in and of itself because we don't live far from each other so picking and dropping is no issue and she can easily be dropped off to school no matter where she stays. The issue is my wife agreed to it without consulting me.Jane is currently doing a certification course for the next 12 months and they have classes on Saturdays from 9-5pm. She asked me if I can babysit Emily on Saturdays, but I can't because I play golf with my brother and sister on Saturday mornings from 8am-1pm. This has been our tradition from before Jane and Emily came into my life and I had told Jane from much before that this is important to me and my siblings. She asked if I can move to another day but that's not possible either because my siblings also have jobs and families of their own so Saturday was the best day for us. I told her she can hire a babysitter but she doesn't want to spend money when I can do it for free.I told her that wouldn't work for me. She then got mad and said golf is stupid and I should put my step-daughter over my siblings. That pissed me off so I told her I'm not going to sacrifice my hobbies just so that she can have a free babysitter. For the record, I don't have anything against Emily. I've babysat her before and she's a good kid. If there was a family emergency or if it was an occasional occurrence, then yeah I would cancel golf for that day to take care of her but I can't give up something this important to me for 12 months continuous.She called me a selfish asshole and slept on the couch last night.

I said \"WTF they're made from breast milk\" and he said he didn't notice that caption.Today I baked the baby some muffins. It's a recipe that called for a half cup of breast milk so I made them per recipe. FIL came over unannounced and said \"oh yum, someone's been baking\" so I told him \"those muffins are for the baby, they're just fruit, flour and breast milk. I have a normal cake we can have\".I then left the room to wash my hands, came back and one of the muffins was missing. I asked husband and he had no idea so I asked FIL and he said that he ate it. I said that's disgusting, I told him they were the babies and contained breast milk. He doubled down and said it's ok because \"breast milk is vegan\" (note, no one in this story is vegan). I told him he's a creepy pervert and to get the fuck out my house.Husband is baffled by the whole thing and was convinced it was a misunderstanding even though I explicitly said they're made with breast milk.FIL said I'm a dick because I'd made loads and the baby wouldn't miss out.MIL was blowing up my phone until I asked her if she was really ok with FIL drinking milk that came direct from my breast, I think she didn't get the whole story.My sisters say it's fucking gross and FIL is a weirdo.UPDATEI asked my husband what he thought I was mad about (he was in the room but on the other side and occupied with the baby) and he said he didn't realise that his dad actually ate the muffin, he thought I was pissed because he was messing with them. He also didn't remember the group chat incident but agreed that both incidents together is creepy.I called MIL to \"clear the air\" and she revealed that FIL has always been \"very interested\" in lactation and she actually only fed husband for 4 months and always behind a locked door! Apparently he moved jobs after a woman complained that he kept intruding on her pumping in a designated space in the office.I've told them FIL is not welcome around me and have asked for the key to our house back.I shared the concerns about him tampering with my milk (and contaminating it) and also that if his own wife wanted him locked out then I'm entitled to that too.The comment that hit my husband was the one about FIL getting off for years on the memory of eating the gross AF baby muffin.

He had one more chance then he had to find somewhere else to live.Sean said he was sorry and he promised he would behave.  He even showed me that he bought edibles so he wouldn't get his sister high, stink up the house, or need to open his window.It was fine for two weeks and then he did it again.   So I kicked him out.  I packed up his shit and took it all to his mom's place. And I had the lock codes changed.When he got home from school he lost his shit.  He said that I was being a controlling bitch and that I didn't have any right to tell him what to do in his father's house.  I laughed in his face.  I told him that the only house his father ever bought is the one his mother lives in.  His dad is my husband but they are both living in my house.I guess he didn't know that and he started apologizing.  I called him an Uber to take him to his mother.   He didn't go and he called my husband instead.  My husband made arrangements with his brother for Sean to move there.  His mom drove all his belongings back into town and now he isn't my problem.Unfortunately for Sean his uncle is completely against cannabis. So he can't have any there.  And he is currently sleeping on a hide-a-bed.  His dad, uncle, and himself are going to build him a room in the unfinished basement this weekend.My husband is on my side since Sean broke our agreement.  His mother is salty about having to come into town.  And Sean is begging me to let him come back.",

His gf is currently pregnant with him in 4 months.My brother asked to bring his girlfriend for dinner in order to catch up and I said sure, why not. However the moment she entered my house she started complaining about the smell of the steak I was making and said just the smell alone makes her nauseous and she can't eat this. I tried to suggest an alternative, but she was dead set on Chinese food and ended up sending my brother to the nearest mall in order to get her some. I thought that would be the end of it, but after going to the bathroom and coming back, I caught her throwing my unfinished steak into the garbage. I asked her what the hell she was doing and said the smell was so strong she thought she'd end up throwing up on the floor and she needed to get rid of it and then started spraying a perfume from her purse in my kitchen. I was beyond furious at this point and sent her back to the living room and after my brother came back from the mall, I kicked both of them out with their Chinese food.My brother tried to convince me to let them back and that I could make something else for the two of us and his gf was pretty much sobbing at this point, but I was dead set on kicking them both out. However my parents ended up being mad at me for apparently causing so much distress to my brother's pregnant gf. I told them that she literally threw away our dinner, but they said that I shouldn't have yelled at her or kicked them out as she's still just a teenager who's now getting influenced by her pregnancy hormones and that my outburst also caused problems in their relationship as she ended up sending my brother to sleep on the couch that night (even tho he literally defended her as well against me, so I have no clue how this is my fault).AITA for apparently not having enough tact to deal with a pregnant teenager ?Edit: Spelling.",

I still don't want to put an adult problem onto my kids, so I only gave them a brief overview of the dire financial issues we're having after my husband/their father passed away. Us downsizing to a 1 bedroom apartment was not by choice.I also told them the truth about how I couldn't afford to feed us all and why I didn't eat 2 days of the week. I was afraid of how they would take the news, but it had gone better than I expected. My kids will be coming with me to the food bank for the next trip to help out.In terms of the rooming situation, both my older kids agreed that they did not want to share a room with my youngest 2F because she frequently wakes up at night and also has accidents. They also don't want to share with me because I get up much earlier than them to work, and it would disrupt their sleep. They would rather share the room with each other while I continue to sleep in the living room with my youngest.My 16M and 14F told me that their friends were saying no kid should ever have to watch their sibling because they didn't create them. They've been told by their friends that it's parentification to be asked to babysit for even an hour, and it is never okay in any circumstance. That was why they kept calling me an asshole when I asked if they could help with childcare so I could get a 2nd job.Now that they know how bad the situation is, my son said he wants to find a part time job to help contribute. My daughter apologized and said it wasn't that she hated me or her sister. Both my son and daughter said they are willing to help take care of the youngest so I can get a 2nd job.

They didn’t offer to hire me, and I didn’t ask because I already have a fast food job.Anyway, my house is pretty close to the shop, and my friends and I decided to meet up there yesterday for icecream and to hang out. For reference, we’re a group of four high schoolers. It was pretty busy, so we got in line. About a minute in, we brother came out of the back and waved me over. He handed me an apron and asked me to help out his coworker in the back because they had to clean the machines ASAP but my brother had to open a second register because of how busy it was.I refused on the grounds that I wasn’t being paid, and he said that I had to help out because it’s the “family business” and because of how swamped the place was and how panicked his coworker was. He even offered to let my friends skip the line if I helped out for ten minutes to give his coworker a hand, and said I owed it to him to help out because I “brought such a big group in”. I decided that that would cause a scene in a packed shop, and refused again. He huffed and waved me off, then went to open the second register.I went back to my friends and the rest of our meet up went well, but my brother kept giving me dirty looks until we got our cones and left.Later that night, my parents confronted me and said that what I did was petty. They told me to work a shift the next day to make up for it, but backed off once I reminded them that I have an actual job that I was scheduled to work pretty much all day the next day.I ended up getting off scot free, however my whole family maintains that I’m petty and lazy, and now I’m wondering if they’re right.

I (f21) as well as my 5 siblings (from 29 to 37 years old) have all been pranked on our birthdays and on Christmas and usually it’s one or two gifts. This Christmas though, I was the only person to get all joke gifts. For example, I unwrapped a MacBook from my brother, but when I opened it, it was just some chocolate (which I don’t eat so I gave it away) and the MacBook was actually given to my sister inside a bag she wanted. Another “gift” was what I thought was a book I put on my Christmas list was actually just the book cover put on a dictionary. When I asked my mom about the book she told me she gave it to my SilThis went on with each present my siblings or parents had given me. AirPods was just a charger block? Adapter? gift cards were used and had $0 balance, a card with Monopoly money, and so on totaling to about 12 joke gifts. I realized I went out of my way to get everyone something they wanted or they’d like didn’t get anything. At this point i was bummed so I went to the living room to watch tv with my boyfriend. At dinner they were all talking about how much they loved their gifts and when my dad asked why I hadn’t said anything about mine, I said there wasn’t much to say. Everyone but my boyfriend laughed and my mom said it was no big deal as everyone else also got some joke gifts. I told her every gift I got was a joke gifts and that the ones they got was also followed by the real one. My dad told me I needed to relax as I’m making a big deal about it and I’d have next Christmas to get the stuff on my list.Not wanting to go back and forth i told my boyfriend I wanted to leave and we can spend the rest of Christmas break with his family then go home. My family got mad and told me not to go and to just stay because it wasn’t serious. I left and put my phone on do not disturb during the drive and by the time we got to bf’s parent’s house, I had several missed calls and texts from them calling me names like ungrateful, sensitive, and childish. They said I ruined Christmas and made my parents upset cause I left. The next day, I exchanged and opened gifts with my boyfriend and his family and one of the gifts I had gotten was the book I wanted (the book my mom pretended to gift me). I posted it on my instagram story and not even 0 minutes after posting it, my sister sent a screenshot of my story to the family group chat and they basically got mad at me for leaving and telling me I ruined Christmas over some presents. They told me I owe everyone, especially my parents, an apology because my mom spent new years sad because of my actions. Now I just want an outside party to tell me if I’m TA here? Am I in the wrong for being upset about the gifts and for leaving? After reading their messages and sitting on this for a few days I’m now feeling like maybe I was upset over nothing and need to apologize to them.*Gonna edit as there may have been some misunderstanding, my Christmas list didn’t include expensive gifts nor was I upset I didn’t receive expensive gifts. I was merely upset because of being pranked with everything I got and being the only person who didn’t get a real present that is all. Another thing I’ll address is I dint do anything to my family which would warrant them doing this. The last “big argument” I had was with my sister which was over a year and a half ago. Thank you for the replies and I will try my best to reply to comments while I’m at work.

I finally gave in when I felt we were ready to take one on, and also when I felt he was ready for the responsibility that comes with one. I expected a dog or cat, but he really wanted a hamster. So we spent a little over a week prepping, helping him “study” hamster care and dedicated a sizable spot in our living room for necessities and home.We finally get around to picking one out at the pet shop, he’s set on the name Sonic, but the lady ringing us up mentioned the one he picked out was a girl and that she could get him a boy if he wanted, and he just lit up and said “That’s Amy!” and that was that, we took Amy home. This was in March.My sister-in-law found out she was pregnant somewhere around that time, and last month they found out they were having a girl. Basically what happened was, they were picking out names and one of the names they narrowed it down to had Amy as the middle name. I made a joke of something like “Hey, we already have an Amy at our house!” Trying to be funny, but SIL didn’t think it was. I didn’t think much about it at the time, but a couple of days ago she asked to come by to talk.She started off by saying the joke I made was in bad taste, I apologized for it, and then she suggested I change the name. I told her I didn’t think that would go over well with my son, and then she outright demanded it be changed “whether he likes it or not” because she wasn’t going to have a child share the name with a hamster. I agreed to talk it over with my son to see what he thought, and of course he didn’t want to, he even thought it was cool that his cousin would share her name with his hamster. I tried convincing him to rename her Sonic even, or some other Sonic character, but he didn’t want that. I explained how SIL feels about this, and he felt a bit hurt because he thought he upset SIL but he really didn’t want to change the name and didn’t understand why they couldn’t just share it.I told SIL that my son was set on Amy, and she blew up. I’ll admit I got a bit defensive and reacted poorly, but I essentially told her it wasn’t a huge deal, it’s not like anyone is going to make the connection and by the time her child is old enough to know her name, Amy the Hamster likely won’t be around. She claimed it was embarrassing because she would always know the connection in her mind, to which I simply told her if it was such a strong reminder of a hamster then maybe it wasn’t a name she should use for her daughter.My brother has told me that I am being selfish for not forcing my son to pick another name, SIL obviously thinks I’m TA, and my mom has said the whole thing is childish.

	"body" : "My son just graduated high-school and we were paying so he could go on a road trip with his friends. He was suppose to go Wednesday , my wife’s mother and father got in a car accident. They live in another state so we had to drive about 4 hours. My wife was a wreck and wasn’t in the position to drive since we her dad was critical. He pulled through luckily.We have two other kids 11 and 7. We can’t leave them at home alone and we couldn’t find a sitter to watch them on such short notice, we even tried our neighbors but he couldn’t do it. So that left our 18 year old. He was pissed to put it mildly but did it. I told him we would make it up to him, and if he could ask if his friend could move it back a week. They couldn’t sadly.We were gone for two days, he pulled though. My wife stayed and I headed back, I payed him for watching the kids and went to talk to him about getting him on the trip. It was suppose to be two weeks and they should just be a state over. He blows up about ruining his trip and there is no point going even though it should still 12 days of the trip. He called up a jerk and lock himself in his room.I need another opinion since this was emergency and he doesn’t seem to care his grandparents almost passed.Edit: Well he called his mom, let’s say it didn’t end well,  he did say basically said the same thing he said to me, wife had a breakdown on the phone with him, she sent him the injuries and pictures of grandpa/grandma. He finally came out of his room and told me he isn’t going to go on the trip and the plan tickets aren’t needed.Talked to my wife, never heard her that mad. Son confirmed what happened, he started yelling at her the moment the call started and she lost her shit when he called her selfish. On good news grandpa has some feeling back in his legs which was a huge concernFor people saying we didn’t have emergency plan we do, first my closest friend- vacation, main babysitter- not available, backup babysitter- not available, last resort grandparents- hospital.  We tried to find someone that why we even asked our neighbor which I have a good relationship with.This will be my last update, had a conversation with my son about everything. Mom and him will have a conversation when she is calms down. His friends are not a state over, they are about two down at this point and going to Mexico. They are probably will get to the boarder tonight, they were suppose to be going to California . He had his passport and everything ready. This is a fucking mess.I haven’t informed my wife yet and will wait until she is calmer. I’ll leave off with I hope none of you ever have to deal with a situation like this and please remember your parents are human",

My mom was very close with her Dad and his name was Andrew (also went by Andy). The technical female Version of Andrew is Andrea but neither my mom nor dad liked the name but my mom wanted to honor her dad in some way so I got named Andi. Which I love my name I think it fits me.My parents got divorced when I was 8 and I live with my mom most of the time but visit my dad every other weekend (as well as holidays). 3 years ago my dad started dating his now fiance “Kate”. Kate for some reason when we met assumed my name was Andrea. I explained to her it was just Andi. She kept calling me Andrea though. I ended up telling my mom about it and she told me just to ignore Kate until she calls me Andi.Well, this past weekend I was at my dad’s and we were visiting some of Kate’s family. Well, she kept calling over for Andrea and of course, I ignored her. She got mad and said why am I ignoring her and I said because that's not my name and you know this. Her dad and brother basically laughed saying they thought I just went by Andi as a nickname and I said no it's just Andi. They then asked Kate why has she been calling me Andrea then. Well, Kate later got made calling me a brat for embarrassing her. She went on to say I knew who she was talking about and that I should have just gone with it but I was being an AH. I honestly kind of feel like in that instance I should have just answered to Andrea but I don't know. AITA?",

I didn’t say anything to her or her parents (by brother and SIL) in the moment, and I tried my best to ignore it. But when I got the first drafts back from our photographer, I couldn’t stand when I saw her in her white dress standing next to me.My husband saw how upset I was, and suggested that we pay extra to get my niece’s dress photoshopped to a light blue. We thought it through, and since we had some budget left, we went for it.Well, last week, we got the final photos back and they looked great! I could hardly even tell that my niece was originally wearing white, and she still looked really nice.I posted some of the photos on social media, and my SIL messaged me and was angry that I photoshopped my niece without checking with her (my SIL) first. She accused me of thinking my niece was ugly and of body shaming her. To be clear, I did not have her body photoshopped, only the color of her dress and gloves.I don’t think I’m in the wrong, but this situation has been stressing me out, so AITA?Edit: small clarification: the picture I posted was a large group shot that my niece is in.

She was rude, abrasive and demanding.

She even wanted to know about my sex life! Just.. seriously? Who asks this stuff of a literal stranger unfortunate enough to be eating delicious fair food at the table area? I just stared at her in shock as my delicious deep fried BBQ got cold.So I smiled as politely as I could manage and this is where I may have been the asshole. I started to ask her about her last GYN visit. Were the stirrups too high, did she have to do that awkward shimmy/scoot down the table, if the speculum was cold, if the PAP smear hurt, the usual. If she felt entitled to my answers, I should be entitled to her answers, right?Well, she threw an absolute fucking fit. Started screaming and yelling that I was gross and a pervert and on and on and on. Her group tried to calm her down and one of them told me I should’ve just been polite and answered her questions. As far as I could tell this woman wasn’t impaired in any way. She didn’t have a carer or minder, she was with a group of friends and had been carrying in normally with them until she saw me. I got to the table, asked it the space was free and set up at the end of the table because my chair fits neatly on the end of one piece picnic benches.I told the group that if she wanted my personal and private medical information then she should trade info for info. Two of the people called me an asshole when they left, trying to calm down their nearly “hysterical” friend as they left. She was still screaming and shouting how I was a perv/cruel/mean. People were staring at me and I hated it.At the time I felt good for finally finding a shiny, new (but still broken) spine and standing up for myself. So to speak. I was talking to friends last night and they said I was an asshole, I could’ve politely told her I wasn’t going to tell her. I tried that when she came over and demanded answers, not even asked for them.So reddit, I’m asking here. Am I the asshole for not divulging my medical info and asking her about hers?",

I explained that we had a strained relationship and that I preferred to keep him at a distance.  She agreed.I guess she thought she knew better than me.

My brother brought my nephews (4 and 8) over as well.I used to wear my engagement ring all the time, but lately I keep it in my walk in closet and mainly wear it for special occasions. While I was cleaning up the dinner table, my nephews went to go play while the adults were still in the outdoor patio/outdoor kitchen area. My brother was not supervising his kids.During this time, my nephews went into the master bedroom without anyone knowing and started playing with everything. Including my engagement ring. When we came to look for them, they paniced because they know they aren't supposed to be upstairs, ran into the master bathroom and flushed my ring.We called a plumber in case it was somehow in the u trap of the toilet and not actually gone. But nope. Unfortunately it was gone for good.We still had the original receipt, so I called my brother. I emailed him a scanned copy as proof of the cost and asked him to reimburse me for the ring my nephew flushed. Immediately he started calling me an asshole because we were family and he was just a child. He has refused to repay the cost of my ring.I told him I will be taking him to court for this and now my entire family is blowing up my phone saying family shouldn't sue each other and just let it go.Edit: No, the ring was not insured. I found out the day after my nephew flushed it. My husband says he forgot and in the end never actually insured it.Edit 2: My brother says he does not have the money to repay even $100 per month and has refused any kind of repayment plan. He said I live in a nice enough house and if I want a replacement, I should just sell my car.Edit 3: My brother, to this day, has not truly apologized. It was a Canadian sorry. Sorry, not sorry. He said kids will do what is normal for kids, and they shouldn't be held responsible for a ring. They were supposed to supervise their kids outdoors with the rest of the family while I was busy cleaning up.Edit 4: I don't believe for a second my brother and his wife cannot pay for the cost of my engagement ring. They don't make anything near my husband but they have a combined income of around 250k. They don't pay rent or anything because my parents gifted them their old house valued at 3.5 million in Toronto, ON, CA back when I bought my parents a new home years ago. There is no mortgage on the home my brother lives in. The only things my brother and his wife would have to pay for is the cost of raising their children, normal bills, and food. I feel so distraught because my ring holds great sentimental value. I've already been speaking with my husband's family lawyer, but at this point, I'm ready to hire a PI to find out if they really don't have the money.",

My sister asked if we could host his party here on the “family property” meaning at my house.I told her no, because my nephew is not allowed at my house. My nephew does not respect boundaries and treats everything like his plaything, including the boundaries of my older black lab, Davos. He constantly chases him around and tries to pick him up despite me telling him to constantly leave him alone. Davos has arthritis and can’t be chased around and hates loud noises which my nephew is very loud.As far as I know he is neurotypical.My sister blew up at me telling me I was putting a dog before my nephew and it was grandma’s property that I can’t dictate. I told her it was my property, I bought it and tended it and pay all the bills for it.My mom called me and asked if I could just put Davos in a room during the party and suck it up for just a day, but I said no. This is his house and he’s allowed to go wherever he wants and I won’t shut him in a room.Now my family is divided, some of them calling me immature and selfish and others saying I’m right, while some including my father refuse to get involved.Am I the asshole?Edit to add bc I’ve gotten this question a couple times if the other members of the family were offered the house.My nana and I have always had a very close relationship, and I’ve helped her tend the property for as long as I can remember. So she offered to sell it to me when she grew too old to tend to it herself. So no, other family members weren’t given the opportunity to buy it but they also weren’t interested in it. It is very old and out dated and my sister especially always talked about how much she hated the aesthetic of the house. The sole reason she wants to host it here is because my house has the most space. It’s not a sentimental space for her.Someone identified me so unfortunately I have to take down the dog tax.

My husband shut me down pretty much immediately and things went ahead as planned.First of all, the 3.5 hour car ride was (predictably) hell. Boys fighting and riling each other up the whole time. Husband and I kept trying to reassure each other that things would be better once we got there and they would be too excited to cause trouble.We were wrong.

I put my foot down and told him that I didn’t even want to be there at that point so either I was leaving, or we all were. He got super pissed and told me it was ridiculous and unfair to our daughter. I actually agree with him but saw no other choice at this point. Of course when I tell the kids they immediately burst into tears and are begging to stay, promising they will behave.My mother, who came with us, was also near tears. She thinks her precious grandbabies do no wrong.  She argued with me too, begging me to “just let it go” but I refused to budge. So, we left, less than 24 hours into a 4 day vacation.Half the ride home was spent with them sobbing and my husband pretty much gave me the silent treatment the whole way. My mother decided to stay behind a little longer but then started randomly texting me about 30 minutes in, asking if I was serious (she knew I was) and told me the whole reason she came was to spend time with the kids, so I had now “ruined it for everybody” and “they’re only little once”.Here we are the following evening and pretty much no one likes me right now except my 3-year-old.

With our busy lives, this day is important to us because besides holidays, we wouldn't be able to meet up and chat or eat without it.We come from an Italian family but are in Canada (my mom was born there, I was here). I take my food very seriously, especially Italian food, and double especially because my nonna is eating with us.I spent all day preparing dinner and when we sat down to eat, my sister's boyfriend is humming and hawing saying my meal is missing something. He said he needs hot sauce and starts walking to my fridge. All I have is Franks and Sriracha. I like hot sauce, too, but I don't dare mix cuisines like that.So I stopped him saying I'd appreciate if he enjoyed my meal as it is. He said it's no big deal, and in a way it isn't, but also in many ways it is. I told him at the very least, I have some Calabrian chili oil he can use, or dried chili flakes. Then it would at least still be Italian. He insists on Sriracha, and I declined him.He escalated it and said he was going to go to the store and buy his own bottle and return if that's the case, and I said by all means. He left, we finished up dinner, and we called it an early night. Everyone is putting their coat and shoes on as he returns, and he's pissed.Was I TA? My sister is on my side if it matters, but this has been a fight all day yesterday between them because he wants my sister on his side, not mine. They've been dating only 3 months.edit: if it matters, I made carbonara, bruschetta, and then for mains which he didn't get to yet, was a seafood platter in red sauce.

	"body" : "My wife, Lena, crochets a lot and often gifts it to friends and family. When her 2nd oldest brother got married, she made the bride a shawl to wear over her dress in the evening. The bride loved it and ever since Lena has made shawls for everyone in her family getting married.Now Lena’s oldest brother, George, is getting married again. Lena doesn’t have a relationship with George as he was abusive to her as a child, but if she has to see him then she is polite but distant with him. She doesn’t want to cut off the rest of her family because of George. I work with George and while we aren’t friends, we are friendly at work – Lena encouraged this, when George got moved to my team I was going to request a transfer not wanting to expose Lena to George as my team do a lot of get togethers with our significant others. As it is a family wedding, Lena’s mom asked her if she could crochet a shawl for George’s fiancee and Lena agreed. It was arranged that once it was finished I would take it to work to give to George so that Lena didn’t have to see him.Earlier this week, the shawl was completed and I emailed George at work to let him know that I would bring it in today as the wedding is tomorrow. When I got into work this morning, I gave George the shawl and let him know that Lena and I were looking forward to the wedding. Come lunch time, Lena called me to let me know that George’s fiancee had called her and told her that she was no longer invited to the wedding citing the place they are having the wedding and the reception at is too small for the number they have coming so are having to make cut backs. However I was still invited to the wedding. I was mad at this because they clearly only invited Lena to get a shawl, which to me is just rude. If they had asked Lena outright to make one, she probably would have done because she loves to crochet.On my way out of work, I noticed George wasn’t at his desk but the shawl was. I was still mad that they had used Lena to get a shawl and I just shoved it in my work bag. I left a note on his desk telling George since Lena was no longer invited, the shawl and I would no longer be attending either. On my way home, I told Lena what I had done and asked her if she wanted to go out instead, so not to waste having a sitter. Lena was upset that I had taken the shawl as it was causing an uproar in her family group chat where people were calling her petty because I took it back.Lena wants me to give it back. I don’t think I should, they don’t deserve Lena’s kindness. However, at the same time, I don’t want Lena to be upset with me over George and a shawl.Am I the asshole for taking back the shawl?Edit: I have messaged the group chat, letting them know that I took it and if they should be pissed at anyone then it should be me but I would also do it again because no one gets to be a dick to Lena.",

	"body" : "Throwaway because some people from my extended family use reddit. English is my third language so please excuse any mistakes.For my daughter's 15th birthday, my spouse and I paid for her to take some of her friends out to a restaurant for dinner. During this dinner/party, my daughter got into an argument with one of her friends (15F). Apparently my daughter was upset that this friend gave her a cheap gift bought from a thrift store. According to her best friend(15F), who told us what happened, my daughter seemed to like the gift at first and asked her friend where she bought it from. When the girl admitted it was from a thrift store, that is when my daughter lost it and called her names like cheap, golddigger, begger (translated from my language, it roughly means cheap) and other classist insults.Now it is well known that this friend's family is not well off, but I know that she is a sweet girl who did her best to get my daughter a gift with her meagre allowance.My spouse and I confronted our daughter about it and she admitted she insulted her friend. She went on to insult her further by saying things like - this is probably the only way she gets to eat at a restaurant so she should be grateful and give a decent gift. I don't know where my daughter learnt such entitlement, but she did not learn it at home. Even her best friend was uncomfortable by her behavior.We immediately took away all her gifts and donated them. We also told her that unless she apologizes to this girl in front of everyone who was present at the party, we will not be sponsoring any more of her birthdays. My daughter never apologized, and over time, the girl drifted apart from the friend group. My daughter's 16th birthday is coming up next month and she has started talking about what kind of party she wants. I reminded her of our promise that we would not fund any more birthday parties until she has apologized for her behavior at her previous party.Daughter is saying it's been a year and the girl is no longer her friend anyway. She said her best friend is getting a sweet16 party (not a thing in my culture) and how will it look if she doesn't get one? We told her she still has a month to apologize, but she is not planning to do it because she thinks we'll cave. My in-laws are offering to pay for her party, but we have forbidden them from doing that. Daughter and both sets of grandparents are telling us that we are being too harsh and ruining her social life.WIBTA If we don't give her a birthday party this year?",

Most of my colleagues are a few years older than I am and some have kids.We were all wearing bikinis and having a nice time so far. Then out of the blue one colleague complimented me on my body.

Ever since I’ve been working I dance less though.

I didn’t say anything because I am pretty uncomfortable with body talk in general.

	"body" : "Hi! Obviously a throwaway for privacy, also am new to posting so I hope I do this correctly!When I was 18, my dad gifted me a house with two stories. I am extremely thankful, we are not upper class but my dad bought this house for a cheap price a long time ago (it was his grandmothers cousin's house). I know that this was an extreme privilege and I am forever grateful for this.The layout of this building is like an apartment, but it is a house. So basically, each story has its own separate entry, its own kitchen and bathroom. I live upstairs while I rent out the downstairs. My boyfriend 25m moved in with me about three months ago and we have been together for six months. I have not asked him for money, neither for utilities or to pay me any rent. The only thing he contributes to is groceries, that we split 50/50. I have not brought up that I own the building as it is not something I tell many people, if people ask me I of course tell them that I own it, but if they just assume I am a renter then they can believe that. The topic of a landlord, the renter downstairs or the owner of the building has not been something we have talked about.This last Tuesday the renter came up to tell me that her freezer has stopped working. I answered the door and my boyfriend heard us talking I suppose. I went downstairs to take a look and we came to the conclusion that she would buy a new one, send me the receipt and I would give her the money. She was very grateful for this solution.When I went upstairs my boyfriend asked if it could be fixed, I told him no, but she was going to buy a new one and I would pay for it. He looked at me like I was crazy and asked me why the hell I would pay for her freezer, I told him that because I am her landlord and the freezer was there when she started renting, I would stand for the cost. He just asked me if I was serious, to which I said I was. He begun screaming at me, asking him why the hell I would hold this information from him and that I was an evil person. I said I was sorry for not telling him but I did not think that it would matter. He said he could not believe he was together with someone who is a landlord, that all of us just use people for money and that the only thing “we people” care about is money and would rather have people be homeless then offering affordable rent. (The downstairs is 1 kitchen, 1 bath and 4 other rooms, I charge 500 dollars in rent). I understand many people have had trouble with landlords, but I try my best to be a good one. He demanded that I give him 50% of the money I make from rent or else I was just as bad as he thought.Was I really the asshole for not telling him? He has not talked to me since Tuesday and I have tried telling him that I am truly sorry but he doesn’t answer me at all.Edit: obligatory edit to add that I certainly did not expect this to blow up the way it did, I have tried to read as much as I can. Thank you all for your advice and support, I have talked with him and I will update later tonight when I had have time to process everything that went down and try to write it out as best as I can. For the people who was worried about my safety, I called my dad who was sat outside in his car when I talked with my boyfriend and I am safe as of right now and hope it will continue that way.

My wife admitted she knew from the beginning but didn't tell me, thinking she was protecting my feelings. I was devastated, feeling the weight of past hurts and fresh betrayals. In my pain, I cleared out the nursery and, in a moment I regret, told her mother she wasn't welcome at upcoming family events, seeing her as part of the deceit.I acted out of deep-seated emotions and past traumas.

Now that I'm alone with her half the time, I have to figure it out.

She said she could do my daughter's hair in the mornings if I dropped her off earlier (dropoff starts at 8, I usually drop her off at 8:45 but her teacher says if I drop her off by 8:20 she'll be able to take care of her hair). She gave me a list of curly hair products to buy and what to bring to school. She also gave me some tips for washing and caring for it at home.I guess my daughter told my ex that her teacher does her hair, not me, and that she goes to daycare early now because my ex called me and asked if I really drop her off a half hour early every morning just so I could \"avoid doing her hair\". She called me a bad parent for \"relying on a teacher to do my job\" and for messing up the morning routine so we could get to school early enough for the teacher to do her hair (we used to wake up, give her a bath, I'd attempt to do her hair, we'd have breakfast, then go to school but now we wake up, take a bath, and eat breakfast in the car).I thought I was doing right by making sure her hair is cared for on my weeks but my ex feels very strongly about this so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.Edit: I'm going to add some things to the post that I'm seeing in the comments. I am learning how to care for her hair. Her hair is healthier now than it was a few weeks ago. I have her hair down on the weekends because I still suck at styling it but it still looks good. The teacher really seems to enjoy doing her hair. I know she does other kids' hair but it's not exactly a set thing. Lastly, my ex was not willing to teach me how to do her hair when we were married and is not willing to teach me after the divorce.",

When I sent her a text telling her we were engaged, she responded by saying “congratulations.” But then when I saw her the week after that, she got all serious and said I should strongly consider the marriage.She told me I was young and could meet people I loved more. That was offensive to me because I love Derrick more than anything, and she’s basically saying my love isn’t that important. She also told me that Derrick and I could date for longer before we got married. But we are already fully committed to each other, so we might as well get married and be recognized as soul mates in the eyes of the law.Anyway, the conversation was so hurtful to me. I eventually asked her, very directly, “do you support me marrying Derrick?” She said no. So I stood up, told her she shouldn’t be at the wedding if she didn’t want us to get married, and left.

I was trying to relax my wife, but she was going on a complete meltdown rage saying that his mother should be in a home if she cannot keep her hands to herself. What if she got our kid sick, tried to kidnap him, got combative and hurt him.All of which I agree are possible outcomes, but I told her none of that happened so let's just leave it.

About 25 minutes later police showed up and asked what happened and my wife explained everything, you can tell the police where like WTF is wrong with this women. I felt nothing but disappointment. Police took the statement and started laughing as they left. Gave the son of the elderly mom a fist bump and said sorry.My wife was upset I did not have her side, she was upset how I took the side of the son instead of her. I explained his mom was clearly sick, it was a harmless gesture and explained she was one that acted unreasonably. I did acknowledge her concerns, but nothing bad happened we could have just let is slide and went on with our day. She told me I failed as a husband.

	"title" : "AITA for suggesting to my friend that she should shave?",
	"body" : "My (29f) friend, let’s call her Emily (32f) is an amazing person - she’s fun, adventurous, intelligent, super active, a fantastic cook, outgoing and just a great girl to be around. A few years ago she decided not to shave anymore (legs, armpits, female areas) out of protest to the patriarchy, resulting in her having very long dark hair everywhere.A few days ago, we were having a beer and she told me how sad her dating life was, that she kept meeting guys and having very fun dates but never got a call back or when she tried asking for a second or third date, got rejected in a very generic manner. Now after telling her “you’re so gorgeous and wonderful, the right man will come don’t worry” multiple times, I decided to go out on a limb and said something along the lines of “I know this is a very superficial thing to say, but do you think it might help a little if you would shave?“She was very taken aback and told me she was disappointed I would suggest she change her appearance for men and that I was the reason so many women were suppressed. I immediately apologized but the evening was pretty much ruined. I texted her the next day apologizing again for hurting her but she hasn’t replied.I really did not want to hurt her but I also don’t quite see how my comment was that bad so I am not sure how to phrase my apology. So decided to take it here and ask people here how big of an AH I am.UPDATE: I am absolutely overwhelmed by the amount of reactions this got. Thank you all so much for your well-worded answers and for your inputs. Emily messaged me yesterday evening asking if we could talk about the whole thing and we had a phone call.She started by apologizing for her reaction and by the things she said to me. I told her that I wanted her to know that I and many others love her for who she is and the last thing I wanted was to suggest that she change herself for a guy. Another important piece of advice I got here was to make sure she actually was asking for my opinion and not just venting, so I told her that I was very worried I had given her unsolicited advice. Thankfully she didn’t see it that way. She told me I had always been a loyal friend who had her back and she always had valued my advice, which was why she was so taken aback by my comment. I told her that what I should have said is that I feel like in the past, she has been attracted to men who don’t necessarily share her values, and that she might need to be more clear with her dating choices and first make sure they align with her values to avoid being disappointed. She also agrees with this and we really had a great conversation after that. Thanks again to you all for the insightful comments and for your help!",

	"body" : "My husband thinks I'm in the right, but my niece helped me make this post on here to see what other people think.I (52f) have three sons ages ranging from 13 to 20. My oldest son (20m) has a girlfriend (19f) that hands around our house a lot... It's a really small house and doesn't have a lot of space. She's a nice girl but gets on my nerves sometimes because she's always over. I really don't think she's right for my son, either. Our tapwater has a weird aftertaste so I order gallon water bottles and use them to refill a big glass bowl with a tap.It is not cheap to get water and other groceries delivered, so I tell my sons, husband, and the girlfriend to be courteous of the other people who live here and not use up the water, as it runs out fast in our big household.Yesterday, I caught her filling up her big metal water bottle with the jug water, and I calmly told her that other people live here, too, and she shouldn't hog the water all to herself. She was rather short with me and said something along the lines of: \"Actually, this water bottle is big enough to hold all the water someone should be drinking in a day. I'm not hogging water, I'm just trying to stay hydrated.\"I found her tone to be disrespectful and ordered her to leave. She scoffed and went back to my son's room. That's when I really got frustrated. I opened their door and told her she has to leave. My son got really angry with me and told me that my girlfriend didn't do anything wrong and why is it a crime for her to drink water? I explained that I order this water for our family to use, not leeches who hang around all day rent-free. My son's girlfriend got a little teary eyed and left the room and out the front door without saying anything.My son told me that I was a major asshole and should have just minded my business. I think she's just wasteful and a brat. AITA?Edit: Thanks for all the comments. I have spoken to my son about the issue, and you all made me realize that it was deeper than just the water. I showed him this post and explained that it's not her, it's me. I think she reacted that way when I initially told her off for filling up the bottle because--and my son helped me realize this, too--I was never really nice to her to begin with, in the course of their three year relationship (in my defense, she only started hanging around our house a lot about six months ago because she got a license).We called her on the phone this morning and I apologized for my reaction to the bottle. I explained I didn't mean to make her feel bad about the water--it really wasn't that big of a deal, and I feel silly for making it a big deal. She apologized for having an attitude and explained how she can feel a little defensive around me sometimes. I told her and my son that I will work on my attitude. My husband still thinks she was being disrespectful but I explained that I'm the reason she felt the need to act that way in the first place. It's not my choice who my son decided to date and I need to respect his choice. I think she is a sweet girl, and I feel horrible for the way I have been treating her. Again, thank you to everyone for making me realize my mistake.PS: I have looked into purchasing a Brita pitcher to see if that is more cost effective. My son's girlfriend now brings water from home--although I didn't tell her to do that.",

	"body" : "My girlfriend and I (both 26f) have a son who is just over a year old. And there was some major ‘drama’ during the birth.For some context, I have chronic heart problems and have been struggling with it since birth. I had a surgery when I was an infant, another at 7 and another at 15. I haven’t needed one since and have been doing well all around. When my girlfriend was 6 months pregnant, I got really, really ill and it took a massive toll on my lungs and heart. I pulled through but spent about a month in the hospital. I felt so awful that I couldn’t be with my girlfriend (Jane) but she was super great with it.Then, 2 days before the due date, I was rushed into the hospital due to a build-up of fluid around my heart. I had to get the fluid removed asap. When the fluid was all out, my BIL came to visit me and he told me Jane had given birth. I was both ecstatic and devastated.I had to spend the night under supervision but as soon as I was allowed to leave, I went to the maternity wing to see my girlfriend and baby. At the time, all negative emotions were smothered by our bundle of joy but over the months, Jane has been showing more and more signs of resentment towards me.It came to a head last night during our date night. I had the whole day planned; baby had gone to grandmas, her favourite take out, got all her favourite movies ready to play, spa evening planned, etc. But she wasn’t feeling any of it. I asked her what was wrong and she said she’s angry at me for missing the birth.I’ll admit, I didn’t handle it as best as I wanted to, but we argued for a bit and I ended up calling her selfish for saying that. I asked her if she understood the severity of the situation and that I was very ill. She got up and said she wasn't going to let me patronise her and that she's never been disrespected like that before and that she's going to bed.AITA?",

	"body" : "My girlfriend Naomi and I have been together for over a decade. My younger sister, Sarah, ans my girlfriend have never been super close but are friendly when we get together, or I guess they were. When Sarah was in high school Naomi helped her out with some personal things. Sarah got married a few days ago.When Sarah announced her engagement to the family she asked Naomi to be a bridesmaid, which surprised us a little but Naomi was very excited because she's never gotten to do it before and probably won't have the chance. I want to be clear there was no suggestion from either of us Sarah should ask her, it was about two seconds after she told us she was engaged. She said that she was so grateful to Naomi for the help when she was younger and Naomi was very touched.A few weeks later Sarah posts her \"bridesmaid proposals brunch\". Naomi wasn't there. Sarah never said it to either of our faces directly but clearly she'd changed her mind. Naomi was hurt but said she understood because she hadn't expected the ask anyway.That would have been fine, but then a few months later Sarah asks Naomi to go to the batchelorette party and also come get ready the day of with her friends and bridesmaids. Same thing, Naomi says yes and even helped her find a good place to go and a rental. A month and a half before the wedding I'm talking to my mom on the phone and she mentions that Sarah's at her batchelorette... no mention of it to Naomi. Now I'm kind of pissed because Naomi was clearly very hurt at two invites and then being sort of ghosted. A week before the wedding Naomi texted Sarah and asked about getting ready and hair and makeup, and Sarah responds acting confused and basically tells her nicely to just come with me. Then I was really pissed.Sarah wanted this really expensive baking mixer thing for a long time and I got it for her for her wedding gift. My mom had ruined the surprise so she expected it. But after everything with Naomi I felt like being petty, and I cut her a check instead and returned the mixer. A few days after the wedding Sarah texts me saying \"I don't know how to ask this but what happened to the mixer\". And I responded I didn't know how to ask but what happened to treating my gf like a freaking human being. Now my brother and my new brother in law and my mom are all texting me saying \"wtf\" and that I'm ruining her happy time. Naomi for her part says I probably shouldn't have done that but she feels a little vindicated.AITAUPDATE: So I talked to Sasha and things just got more confusing. She said when she asked Naomi to be a bridesmaid she meant an \"honorary\" bridesmaid. She then said for the Bachelorette party Naomi had told her she works most weekends so she didn't think that Naomi was able to attend and was just helping her to plan. Naomi said that she told Sarah to give her dates so she could take off. Naomi is a very non confrontational person and had asked me to not bring up the bridesmaid or Bachelorette things because she didnt't want ro feel like she was \"pushing in\" at the time which is why I didn't. The makeup thing my sister said that Naomi had told her she would do her own hair so she didn't see a reason for her to come get ready with them. My sister is still pissed at me and says I ruined her honeymoon period (she's not on a trip) and some other really crappy stuff so I just hung up on her. She also said that not giving the mixer was rude to her and her husband which is hilarious because my BIL probably figure out how to turn on the oven without neon flashing signs.Thanks for all the comments I've never seen that many on any reddit post I've ever made in my life.",

	"body" : "My sister has been staying with my husband and I (men in our late 20s) for the last week and some change. She and her husband have initiated the divorce process and she said she doesn't want to stay alone right now, which I completely understand. It would be very hard to go from living with a partner to a completely silent house.I opened our home to her before I found out why her marriage didn't work out. Now that the two of us have had multiple conversations about it, I'm a little uncomfortable.There was no infidelity. There was no big scandal. What she told me is that her husband wasn't having sex with her enough.The things she has been saying have floored me. She says without sex, the two of them were basically just like roommates. She said she had been pushing for him to get a hormone imbalance test done because while they were still having sex, it wasn't enough. She said he had begun resisting even normal touches from her because from his perspective, all she thought about was sex which apparently isn't true... I'm not sure I believe that. I can elaborate in the comments but overall it just left me feeling sad for her ex and the disrespect of saying sex is the only thing that separates a partner from a roommate. Not even a friend.I've done my best to be supportive, but I can't relate to the thought process at all. If my partner told me tomorrow that he wasn't up for sex for the next few weeks, months, or longer, I would just take care of myself and respect that. I love him and I want him to be the person I do life with forever.This all came to a head last night. My husband and I were having a typical lazy Saturday night, catching up on some shows and chatting while we lounge on the couch. His legs were in my lap and I was kind of absentmindedly massaging his feet and rubbing his ankles. This was an innocent gesture. My sister came in, saw me doing it, and made a joke along the lines of \"Ah, OP, I didn't know you were into feet\" or \"I didn't know you had a foot fetish.\" The exact wording escapes me.I couldn't help but feel put off at her sexualizing the gesture. Intimacy CAN be sexual, but it doesn't have to be. I told her so, and then said, referring to her divorce, \"You sexualizing every interaction is why you're in the situation you are now.\" She called me a dick and left the room.I already know it was a little harsh, but I'm unsure if it was tough love or too much.AITA?EDIT: I appreciate everyone's recommendation, but I do not like the deadbedrooms sub.

This is on my stomach and it’s where my poop comes out from into an attached bag.You usually can’t see it and it doesn’t look as though I have any kind of disability (although it is legally classed as a disability).To empty it I need to kneel by the toilet and I rinse it out with water. I fill a travel bottle up in the toilet and use this to rinse out the bag. Not rinsing is gross!  Because of needing to kneel and have water on hand, I need to use the disabled toilets whenever I can. I have a radar key to get me into them - it was given to me after I had my surgery. Using a non-disabled toilet is very difficult. Hard to kneel, very little privacy and no sink on hand.Today I was at M&S and had to empty my bag so used the disabled toilet as usual. (FYI - almost all disabled toilets have signs on them that say ‘Not all disabilities are visible’!)When I tried to come out of the toilet my way was blocked by a woman who started to berate me for using the disabled toilet. Apparently she saw me go in and had been waiting for me to come out. She was stopping me from leaving and threatening to call the staff.I tried to tell her that I need to use that toilet and showed her my special radar key. She just kept getting angrier and angrier and louder and louder. We had a crowd by this time!In desperation, I finally pulled up my shirt and slid my trousers down a bit and showed her my Ileostomy bag. I pointed out the sign on the door that said not all disabilities are visible. I told her she was ignorant needed to learn to mind her own business. I then told her to eff off and get out of my way.AITA for being so rude?  I know I should have been nicer but she would not stop blocking me in the toilet.",

One of the things I managed to get was a clause that prohibited my employer from contacting me outside work hours.If it is a true emergency, then they can send me an email. Otherwise they can't even send me a text.Furthermore, I have a separate work phone that I shut down at 5 on the dot, then turn on at 9am.Another thing is that I don't work OT. I am very efficient, so my work is done by 3pm, 5pm if we have an emergency. I also take my whole lunch break outside the office, and my coffee breaks away from my desk.My coworkers are not the same, they tend to socialize during work hour, and have work left for afterwards.They sometimes ask me to \"help\", but I always decline by saying that I have plans. I don't go into details, I just say that I have plans.These plans are 99% of the time just include going home, reading books, or sleeping. But that is my personal time.Monday, a coworker asked me if I could stay a bit later to help her out, apparently she was late with some essential work, but had to be done by that night, because she had to attend her daughter's recital at 6. I said that I was sorry, but that I had plans.It was a nice day, so instead of going home, I just went to a parc to read while breathing some fresh air. Brought some fruit and bubble tea, and made a picnic out of it.My coworker found me there, and she was pissed. She said that I could have helped her if I didn't have plans, I said that I do have plans, this impromptu picnic. She said that it wasn't as important as her daughter's recital. So I said that for me, it was even more important than her daughter's recital.She called me an AH, and some of my friends agree. So AITA?Edit: so I log off for a few hours, log back in expecting maaaybe 100 comments. I am blown, and thank everyone for their judgement, NTA, YTA or ESH.Now for some important things:How did she find me in the park? The park is small, near her daughter's school (I didn't know that), and I was sitting closer to the street. She was driving by looking for parking when she spotted me, and decided to confront me. I guess she wasn't that late for the recital.We are not on the same team. She asked for help because she knew I know how to do her tasks, not because we are on the same team working the same project.For people who are worried about my career, thank you, but don't worry. I am not planning to climb the corporate ladder. All I want is a job that pays enough to live a comfortable middle class life. I invested in a bit of a niche/rare skillset, and it paid me back with a 6 figure salary and being very sought after. All I have to do is to maintain my skillset and keep up with the times, and I will be golden. I have had offers from all around my state, and a few more.For those who say that I am a miserable loner, I have a very fulfilling personal life, with a tight knit family, and a great friend circle. I just prefer to not mix work and personal life, and that means no befriending coworkers. Made that mistake early on, but I learned from it.And lastly, for those saying an impromptu picnic is not \"plans\", enjoying my personal time is and has always been my plans.",

I'm also the planner and the giver in not only my family (husband and kids) but my extended family (parents, siblings, friends, etc), so I'm the one that plans birthday get togethers, gifts, travel etc. I'm also a SAHM due to having a son with complex medical and behavioral needs. I've been with him 24/7 for the last week as it's school break and he's extremely clingy and has behavioral problems due to mental illnesses. I also had a upper respiratory cold during this time, sore throat, fever, cough, runny nose, ear ache. But kept up with mom duties none the less.My husband's birthday was last month and as usual I planned something for him. Weekend in a town a couple hours away for us and our kids.For my birthday I tell him I just want help with the kids, the house cleaned, a nap, and him to cook supper or take me out. Maybe a homemade gift from the kids and a cake.Yesterday, my husband starts complaining of a sore throat. I check his throat and looks fine. No fever or other symptoms.  He stays up all night playing video games.This morning he says he is sick, but has no visible symptoms.  No fever, no cough, no runny nose, doesn't sound like someone with a cold. He says his throat hurts but spent an hour on XBox live talking just fine.He naps all day because he says he's sick, I think it's because he stayed up until 4 a.m. playing video games. Meanwhile I make my own cake, take care of the kids as usual, and do my usual chores. He didn't even tell me happy birthday.Finally I decided to take the cake I made with the kids to my parents house to have supper there so I didn't have to cook. I'm pretty crabby at this point and don't say a word before we leave. He calls and asks why we left. I tell him because he ruined my birthday yet again and I'm trying to salvage it at least a little and hung up. He called back and said I was overreacting. He's sick and I'm an adult, birthdays aren't a big deal anymore after 21.So AITA for wanting 1 day to be the receiver instead of the giver? To celebrate myself?",

	"title" : "AITA for leaving menstrual pads in a visible place in the bathroom?",
	"body" : "My husband (30), his friend (30), and I are currently on vacation, sharing a rented apartment with just one bathroom. Yesterday, I got my period and bought some pads. I left them on the bathroom counter in a semi-sheer bag, where they weren't even visible. However, my husband thought this was inappropriate and could make his friend uncomfortable, knowing that someone in the apartment is bleeding. I argued that menstruation is a natural process and should not be considered gross or dirty. Women shouldn't be shamed or stigmatized because of it, as this has historically caused women to suffer.My husband didn't respond, but I'm still wondering if I was in the wrong for leaving the pads this way.EDIT: Can we get any feedback from males? My husband says all responses are from females, and that’s why I was voted NTA! ",

He tried to explain that he was taking them to his work (bookstore) to get them officially appraised, and it was supposed to be a surprise gift. I chewed him off and asked him how that's considered a \"gift\" and I wanted the books back. He refused. I told him I will be calling the cops his work if he doesn't, and he still refused to bring them back.I immediately called the cops to file a police report and waited until the morning to call his work. I gave them all the details, including the case number, and said I'll be coming with an officer to get my books back from Jay that day. His work cooperated with me and promptly fired Jay after I got my books back.Jay claims that I \"went too far over a few books\" and demands that I give him money until he finds another job. AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for taking my BIL to small claims court over art supplies?",
	"body" : "A bit of context: I (29M) like to draw and try other mediums as well. As such I've accumulated a lot of art supplies over the past few years. My wife (Sally 27F) also dabbles a bit and we have converted one of the rooms in our home to an art studio of sorts. There's easily a few thousand dollars worth of art supplies in that room and we tend to keep it locked for that reason. Most important to me are my pencils and markers which were not cheap (Chartpak for those who care).Onto the story: Sally and I had her family over for her aunt's birthday a few weeks back and my BIL and SIL brought their kids with them (7F and 6M). We had forgotten to lock the door to the room that day. About an hour into the party I noticed that both kids were nowhere to be seen, so I asked my SIL if she knew where they were. She said that they were drawing in the other room. I asked if my wife was with them and she said she (SIL to be clear not Sally) just told them which room it was in. I immediately rushed over to the art room and found it was a total mess. Most devastatingly was the fact that all my markers were ruined because that kids were using way to much force casing the tips to fray. I yelled at them to get out and they started crying. My BIL ran over and started yelling at me saying they're just kids and it's just markers. I told him that the markers alone were 17$ a piece and he said I was stupid for paying that much. Sally tried to diffuse the situation but my BIL starting yelling at her too saying we can't have this much art supplies and not expect kids wanting to use it. I told him he's paying to replace the markers and other supplies they ruined and he told me to go fuck myself and left. Everyone left shortly after that.I totaled up the damages and I needed to replace about 375$ and found that the kids drew on a piece I had spent the past week working on as well as ruining a finished piece Sally did. I sent him a bill and he blocked me. So I talked with my friend who was lawyer and had him draft a claim for small claims court and a letter to send my BIL (I paid him for this ofc). My wife is in agreement about this but her family has been mobbing us telling us we're being ridiculous over some markers. Only my FIL (who also has taken up painting recently) and my other SIL say that BIL has to pay. AITA?Update: First off, holy shit I did not expect this to blow up. I posted, figured I get a handful of responses, and turned off reddit. I am extremely grateful that so many took the time to read and respond to this post, I'm going to read as many comments as I can, but I can't read them all. Either way, thank you all.Anyways, last night my FIL called my wife and told us to come over. When we arrived my BIL and SIL were already there. FIL sat us down and told us we're figuring this out now and anyone who leaves gets written out of his will. BIL asked if he seriously would disinherit him over markers, and FIL asked him \"would you seriously get disinherited than talk this out like adults?\" He called all of us childish but figured the threat of court would make BIL admit he was at fault. He also was mad at me for reacting so nuclear and ruining aunt's bday. After an hour and half of talking BIL said he was sorry and would replace the supplies his kids ruined, I apologized for making a scene and Sally and I are taking aunt out for dinner tonight with FIL as an apology. I don't really care about the judgement here since I realize whether or not I was right for taking BIL to court because my asshood from ruining the party far outweighs that. Hopefully things mend well with my wife's family.",

	"title" : "AITA for not moving out of the property my parents gave me so that my golden child sister, her husband and kid could move in?",
	"body" : "My (34f) sister (31f) was the first among four siblings to have a kid (5f). My niece is incredibly spoiled by my sister, our parents and extended family, and my parents bend over backwards for my sister’s requests (like canceling their anniversary trip because my sister asked to babysit while she goes on a girls' weekend).This spring, my boyfriend and rock in my life passed away. At the same time, I lost my job. I had a lot going on, and moved back to my home town.My parents own a rural property they used to rent out. The property had been empty for a while and fairly run down. My parents invited me to stay there (rent free), told me it was my home for as long as I needed.I invested a lot of my time and money (found a remote gig) into getting the house fixed up. I also made friends with Olha, a Ukrainian refugee with a young daughter. Olha was struggling and I invited her to stay with me for a couple of months while she gets back on her feet (I could use company as well). She was very thankful but hasn't made a firm response yet as she's trying to make things work independently. My parents had no issue with this.Until recent drama. My brother in law had been working for a shady company, which skirted regulations for profit. The law had caught up with the owner, who folded the company and left the country. I’ll cut this short given the post character limit, a few other things went down and my sister’s family abruptly moved to our hometown, moving in with my parents.Almost immediately my parents and sister approached me to swap (I move in with our parents and sis and her family take my place). They said the house I lived in was too large for one person, and it'd be so much better for my niece to live on a beautiful property in natureI didn't understand. My parents have two guest rooms, my sister/BIL and the kid have their own bedrooms (I sure didn’t at 5). My BIL is still loaded from his old job and could easily get them a place, too (they are buying a flashy car).When I mentioned my work on the property, it was dismissed. When I reminded them about Olha, my parents were outraged I was still intent on helping someone else and their child and not my own sister and niece. They kept making out my sister's situation to be nearly as bad as Olha's.Eventually it came down to my parents saying \"you're living on our property, you'll do as we want.\" I said, well you gave it to me and said this was my house as well, to be my home for as long as I needed. But if we want to talk in property terms and not family terms, evict me then.My parents are not evicting, but I receive daily calls and messages from them and extended family guilt tripping me and calling me an AH for not giving up the more comfortable space to my sister, who is in such a difficult situation!and has a little child! Only my brothers see my side, but since they are young men in college their opinion means nothing to my family.I feel like I am taking crazy pills. AITA?",

She sends snacks for all the kids and pays me a small amount of money. I never asked for a lot because it was never a big deal to me and I enjoy seeing my niece and nephew. But now things have changed. My sister is engaged and her future husband lives out of state with his two children. My sister already told me they were hoping I would take care of them. I asked when I would be meeting the kids and she said they fly in just before the wedding and I would start right away.I told her I would like to get to know the kids first and she said they want to start out on the right path with being a blended family and that means treating the kids the same. She said they want them to have that after school time together. I told her I understood but I would not be comfortable taking care of the kids for extended periods of time when I do not know them and will have met them one or two times before they would be placed in my care and I would not be comfortable.My sister asked why I can't just embrace a big change and throw myself in. I told her if she was willing to give me some time to get to know the kids... she said no. So I told her firmly that she would need to find someone else to take care of the kids.My sister told me I was really showing that I only consider family those who are related by blood. But I would feel the same if my brother came back home after several years and asked me to watch his kids who I have never met and they're blood related. For me it's just a position that requires a close, existing relationship for me to be okay with it.AITA though?",

He said he understood.When I got pregnant, he refused any contact with my baby or responsibility. He took things further by telling my friends and his family that I planned the pregnancy to trap him, so they wouldn’t judge his actions. This was untrue. He paid mandatory child support but it wasn’t much.It was hard but I love my daughter and wouldn’t change a thing. She’s wonderful and smart and she’s my whole world.He reached out to me on Facebook saying he wants to be in his daughters life. He’s married now. I did some stalking online, his wife has frequently posted about her infertility struggle.I was against it because he’s had no part of her life. It was me who had to drop out of college, work 2 jobs, endure the sleepless nights as a baby and raise her. It was me that kept her belly full and kept her warm. He didn’t give a shit. It was me that endured my friends turning against me and his family’s harassment. And the judgment of society for being a young mom. And now that he wouldn’t be sacrificing his young years, now he’s finished partying, now he’s got his degree and job, and his wife can’t give him kids to complete his picket fence life, he wants the kid I raised for him? Knowing he doesn’t really have to do any work other than pick her up now and then.I told him my thoughts, and he got mad saying that I chose to have the baby not him, which tipped things over for me. I asked him to prove he thought about her, eg a college fund he’s paid into for a while with her in mind or car money. He did not, which again proved to me he only gave a shit when he couldn’t make more kids.I spoke to my daughter but I told her the type of person her father is. I told her he has nothing for her, and I was honest about the fact his wife is infertile so he is reaching out. I told her everything and reiterated basically everything I said in the post.I told her to think about it, I said I’d support her knowing him, but I affirmed he is not a nice person and his intentions are not where we would want. She chose to not know him.After I informed him he got mad. He said I ruined his chance to know her, that I’m denying her a father, I told him he was the one that did that.My mother told me I shouldn’t have poisoned his image to her, that she probably feels rejected all over again and she’s probably hurting. I now feel like I have done wrong by her. AITA?Edit: she is 16 nowEdit 2: if it wasn’t for the infertile wife, and lack of college fund or car money (showing evidence he had at least thought about her) then I probably wouldn’t have said anything to her about what he is like. But to me those were red flagsEDIT 3: FAQhe never told me he didn’t want kids, he didn’t tell me he wouldn’t stick around for the kid when I told him I wouldn’t abort before anything.Despite this I’m NOT MAD HE LEFT. I am mad he returned  for the WRONG REASONS which could be harmful to my daughter.I am not answering questions on how I got pregnant as this is not relevant. The amount of people I’ve had comment “well were you on birth control?” and the lack of “well did he wrap it up?”  If you’re trying to find out if I poked holes or lied about taking the pill, I did not. If you’re about to accuse of having unprotected sex, again, I did not.Do not ask why I didn’t abort my daughter or refer to her as a consequence. This is rude and you know it.

I usually leave the door to his room closed.I pick up and babysit my two nephews for around an hour on weekdays, since their mom (my sister-in-law) gets off work too late to pick them up. They are 11 and 13. Usually they are well behaved and do their own thing or even sometimes help me with chores.On Friday I was cooking a very pungent soup so I aired the whole house out by opening all the windows and doors. I should have left my son's room closed in hindsight, but I think I opened it out of habit. When their mom went to pick up her kids, I went to get them and saw them messing around with my son's guitar. The older one was messing with the string screws while the younger one was plucking at the strings.I admittedly freaked out a lot and I raised my voice at them, which I have never done. I said, \"What are you doing? Drop that right now! What are you even doing in his room? Get out! Never come in this room again!\" At that point they started crying, I pulled the guitar away, and their mother came in. She tried to mediate the situation and console them, but I told them all to get out of my house and they left. The guitar was thankfully okay and not scratched.Their mom called me later to talk and apologized on their behalf, but told me that she thinks that we should all have a sit down and apologize to each other. She told me that I really scared her boys, and that although she thinks what I did was understandable, I overreacted in front of them. She told me that at the end of the day, they didn't really do anything harmful and that they deserve an apology from me too.I told her I do think that I overreacted but that I wasn't sorry because they could've broke my son's guitar.

I encourage and support newcomers to running, but recently I encountered a situation where I felt gate-keeping was necessary. My sister-in-law got into running last year, and she absolutely fell in-love with it as well. Since I am also a runner, I decided I could connect with her on the topic. I wanted to hear about her runs, her progress, and maybe offer some helpful guidance if she wanted it. So, at a family gathering I ask her about running.After a bit of conversation, she mentioned to me that she ran a marathon. I was quite surprised, she ran a marathon after only getting into running a year ago. That is amazing, what incredible dedication and drive (I thought to myself). I was about to praise her for this incredible accomplishment, but then she explain this \"marathon\" in detail. It was a virtual marathon that she started late last year and apparently completed this year. Basically it was an app based event where you tally up your running distances until you reach 42.2km (26.2 miles). I chuckled slightly and told her that its great she totalled 42.2km in that time-frame, but it doesn't count as a marathon. I told her that a marathons have time limits for completion, usually 6 to 8 hours. If they didn't, then I could claim multiple ultra-marathons via the aggregate distances I ran in my life. Its disingenuous and in my opinion, undermines those who have actually ran a marathon.She didn't take this well, she called me an asshole, a bully, an elitist, and a few other things. I apologized for upsetting her, but I stand by what I said, she didn't run a marathon. I didn't press the subject at all and left it at that, she wouldn't speak to me the rest of the gathering. My wife agrees with me, despite not being a runner herself, she said her sister overreacted. Their mother said that I should have just let my sister-in-law believe that she ran a marathon. Maybe, I don't know....she is 23 years old, without any impairments. Validating her \"marathon\" would feel similar to lying to a child to boost their confidence.

I had a 7 year old from an earlier relationship as well. We didn't have anymore kids.I tried to treat my step children as my own but they never accepted me. They were very rude and insulted me whenever they could. Since I did not work they called me a gold digger who married their dad only for his money.The truth was my grandparents were quite wealthy and left me a lot of money when they died. I lived well below my means and chose to stay home and raise my daughter, since I could afford that. I did not need his money at all. But I didn't bother sharing this with his kids and told him not to either. I did not want them to like me just because they might gain monetarily from me.My husband on the other hand hated how they behaved with me. Their blatant disrespect made him not pay for their College tuition. Their mom couldn't pay for it and they had to take loans for it. They didn't even talk to him.Even when he got cancer, they refused to come see him. For three years we struggled with the treatment. My daughter came to visit from time to time, when she could.During this time only person who really helped both of us was someone we were not related to at all. This girl in her late 20s waitressed at a cafe we frequented. She was a single mom, taking classes at community college at night, working during day and raising her two kids. She took a liking to us and when she learned my husband was sick, spend whatever time she could visiting him. She has stayed nights at the hospital when I needed a break and basically been the daughter we wished for.When he died, she helped me arrange the funeral.

I was pretty irritated at this point because she wasn't even paying attention at all.The third movie started and by then she had opened another bottle of wine and was asleep within the first twenty minutes. I was really mad at that point and just left and went home.A few hours later I got a text asking where I went. I told her I was mad that she couldn't pay attention to my favorite movies on my birthday. She told me I was an asshole and to grow the hell up. I've texted her a couple times but she hasn't responded. AITA?Edit: This has really blown up and I've gotten a little overwhelmed, but I do accept that I was the asshole. Watching 9 hours of movies that she hates was definitely too much of an ask and I shouldn't have reacted the way I did. I just took it personally because I felt like she didn't even try and these movies are important to me. The fact that she isn't much of a drinker and drank this much kind of set me off. I called and left her a voicemail apologizing.",

My wife was invited to be a bridesmaid and she Initially said yes.It turns out that the bride is now expecting my wife to get a whole new wardrobe for the bridal showers, bachelorette party, rehearsal, and reception dinner on top of her bridesmaid's dress. The only color she’s allowed to wear to all of these events is the same lavender color as her bridesmaid dress. She was even given a few swatches of that material to take shopping with her. The shoes and makeup have to match for photos. Even pajamas have to match.The bachelorette party is a week getaway plus all of the other events it’s like an additional 10 days of clothes that my wife will never wear again. She normally wears black or dark color clothes.I bring this up to my brother after he brings hands me the swatches of fabric. I told him this is the dumbest thing I have ever heard. He said that’s why they giving me almost a year to get all of the items together for the bachelorette and weddings. I’m thinking of my wife’s reaction because she’s already not great friends with the bride. I told my brother that my wife can attend the wedding as a guest and not a bridesmaid. My bother gets mad saying I’m upsetting his fiancée’s aesthetic that she’s had planned. He’s just asking for a few days of accommodation and I said no. He tells me I’m no longer his best man for this and I’m selfish for destroying his fiancée’s dream wedding over a few dresses.Edit: I don’t know why Reddit would think I didn’t discuss this with my wife. I told her afterward and she laughed saying “Hard pass” Maybe when your grow up get into a functional healthy relationship you’ll understand that you can predict your partner’s moods and boundaries.",

Stepdad focused a lot of his time providing for us so I never got close to him but I am grateful for him. I am engaged and my sister is going to marry in about a month. My wedding will be in a year. Both of us are close to our mom though.My sister who I will call Noelle, fucked up in my opinion. At first I was on her side but now I just feel bad for stepdad. Noelle isn’t going to have him walk her down and give her away. I understand this is her decision and when that came out I helped my mom and stepdad understand that it was her choice. The turning point happened last week when she told us that he will not be sitting at the family table, when asked her why she made it clear he wasn’t family to her. Again her right but damn he is the reason we had such a good childhood and are debt free ( he paid for college and worked a ton).I knew this would result in them not going to the wedding and they informed my sister. She called me upset and was ranting about how it was her wedding. That she was being abandoned. I had enough and told her she is an idiot if she didn’t think her actions wouldn’t have consequences. She called me a jerk and hung upI am unsure if I was a jerk and I feel guilty since I am now closer to my parents since I promised he can walk me down at my wedding.",

	"body" : "I’ve (M32) been with my girlfriend (F29) for over a year now. She’s smart, funny, a bit quirky, and has a serious job with a good salary. We have a great time together and generally get along very well. The only thing is her choice in home ‘decor’ is bizarre, to put it frankly, and not something you think a normal, grown adult would be into.Her apartment is definitely a reflection of herself and interests. Not in the best way though.My girlfriend has wall dedicated to animation in one room of her apartment, like Futurama pieces and etchings of some weird triangle guy. Then there’s the wall of framed preserved insects in another room. But not insects like butterflies or moths. Instead she displays tarantulas, beetles, and large stick insects. Her bathroom has a subtle theme of the ocean-pretty common. But instead of starfish or shells, she has a little anglerfish nightlight, a small vampiric squid painting, and then a framed diagram of what apparently is a Goblin Shark right by the toilet.I would say a majority of her home decor and furnishings are okay. The apartment itself is very modern and sleek. It’s just the random decor and juvenile-ish themes like cartoons, insects, and bizarre ocean creatures, is off putting.This is where I might be the AH. I avoid bringing people over to her place, especially people from my job, because of how juvenile it looks. Everyone’s impressed when they see the high rise, but that quickly fades once you enter. The one time I brought a work colleague over they ended up telling me after that they found her insect wall terrifying. I work in finance and appearances and first impressions are important.My office will hold casual gatherings where we get together for a few drinks, good food, and we rotate hosts. And this time, it’s my turn. The problem is my place is under some construction and not an ideal place to be right now, so I’ve been staying with my girlfriend. My girlfriend suggested that we host my colleagues here since she has the space and thinks it’ll be fun. I told her I planned on skipping my rotation and seeing if the next person would be okay with hosting early. She kept pressing on why I didn’t want them over here, so I finally said it’s because her home decor is strange and not something a grown woman would have, and also that her insect wall horrified the one colleague that did come over.My girlfriend got mad and said at the end of the day, it’s not my space and these things bring her joy. She also said that she is indeed an adult woman, which is exactly why her apartment is decorated in such a manner.I love my girlfriend, I do. And it’s okay to have different interests. But does an adult really need to decorate with them besides a few things here and there? I mean, my own mother asked if my girlfriend was autistic after she saw the entire apartment for the first time.So Reddit, AITA for telling my girlfriend her home decor is the reason I won’t host a work gathering at her place?",

I started to notice about a year in she was getting overwhelmed and asked what I could to help. She claimed to be fine, but I started to price around childcare options. Spoke with, friends, family, and colleagues looking for any suggestions, recommendations, and resources. That is when my boss told me our job has childcare benefits.Awesome! I start the paperwork, get the approval, and got put on a waitlist. I brought it up with my wife we toured the place with our daughter she loved it. About 4 months a spot opened up, and our daughter is now in daycare. It is run in the same office building I work at, so it is super convenient I drop her off when I head to work and pick her up when I leave. Perfect!Here is where the issue arrives, my wife is not doing anything. We split the household chores. That is how it was in my family growing up and I find cleaning and cooking relaxing. So I am fine with it. That being said my wife has not done much with her day since our daughter started daycare. I understand adjustments take time, that being said the original agreement was for her to be a SAHM, with our daughter in daycare not being rude staying home to be a mom is not happening. I brought up the million-dollar question \"When are you going back to work?\"This may have been a miscalculation on my part, but I figured I am in this deep let's see it to the end. She gave me a glare of death and tried to change the subject. I kindly interjected, not trying to push you but practically speaking I told her that she has no excuse to not be working. This was my tactical error she blew up. Thankfully, during this daughter was at my parent's house so she did hear or see the yelling. We went back and forth using the classic lines from both sides of the camp. She used the good husband provides the option for their wife to stay home. I said if you want to be then either watch our daughter or do the housework. Your being home is not a free pass to do nothing. She clapped back with your coworkers' wives get to stay home and do nothing. I told her I agree but they have cheated on their wives want me to start doing that? I am sure you piece together the rest.The comment about cheating was not a threat, she was using the fact the wives of my coworkers get to be home even though their kids are also in daycare. I pointed out that the husbands are cheating on them. My coworkers' situation is skewed, they have found it is more beneficial to stay together from the wives' side. We live in a state where spousal support has caps and does not matter how many years you were married before. Husbands stick around cause the status quo is just easier.It was just to state that is not the life she thinks it is.Edit: Please it was not meant as a threat, she had envy of other families she knows and wanted what they had. I just told her the truth about what was hiding behind their walls. It was not me saying I would cheat, just me saying the life she is envying is not all sunshine and rainbows. The wives she sees are paying a price that she was unaware of and I know she does not want to pay.She was also a software engineer.She was 100% on board, and I confirmed with her if she was okay with the daycare options, and if not that is perfectly okay.She does not have any mental health issues I am aware of. I have suggested she does speak with her doctor but that is something she has to do, I cannot force her.She did enjoy her line of work or at the very least that is what she told me.I also agree with the things said did not have to be said and that it was not a proper way to handle the situation. Just wanted to clarify that I have no intention or thought of cheating. It was simply a response to her asking why she cannot have what she sees my coworkers wives have.",

He is the type of guy that brags about how he never changed a diaper.Jennifer and Harper are usually at Amber and my house  on the weekends because Harper’s dad is drinking and watching sports all weekend. On Saturdays I normally sped all day with my daughter because I don’t see her as much as i want to during the week. However with Harper being there every Saturday  anything I do with Emma I have to do with Harper. Take Emma to the zoo it’s Emma, Harper and I. Taught them both how to ride bikes, takes them both to dance class, take them both to the kids salon, and so on.Mother’s Day was the last draw, I took them both to dance class Saturday morning ( Amber and I also pay for both dance classes because dead beet won’t)  on the way home Emma asked if we could stop to get something for mom for Mother’s Day, I said sure but then it ended up I had to buy something for Harper to her her mom as well. On the way home I just kept thinking why am I buying someone else’s wife a Mother’s Day gift, that’s his job.A few days later (because I did not want to ruin Mother’s Day) I told my wife that I am tired of raising Harper, her real father needs to step up. I tired of it taking away time I get to spend with Emma. She said that  Jennifer is her best friend and we need to be there for Harper.Now she is not speaking to me and sleeping in the guest bedroom. So AITA?Just wanted to add some updates to questions I see.Emma and Harper are best friends.It was my idea to spend Saturday with Emma, I work more during the week so I wanted to spend Saturday with Emma and to give my wife a bit of a break.We pay for things be Jennifer’s husband thinks it’s a waste on money to pay for dance class and Jennifer can’t afford to pay by herself.Jennifer and Harper do things with Amber and Emma 1 or 2 times a week together during the weeknights.UPDATE POSThttps://www.reddit.com/user/Kitchen_Earth7954/comments/13ya03j/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_im_tired_of_raising/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1",

Rory confided in me that the whole time she was there She couldn't really do anything fun and was stuck watching her younger siblings while Dan and Ida went out. She told me she felt like a babysitter more than a daughter, which hurt my heart for Rory, since she was really excited to see her mother. She also told me she'd like to stick with visits again and not staying for a whole month or 2.Well about 2nights ago I got a call from Ida, she seemed happy and started talking about Rory and how she liked it there. She continued to ramble a bit before asking for me to ask Rory about staying another month. I laughed which caused Ida to be mad and she hung up. Dan texted me calling me an ass for laughing at her, and my brother said it was kind of mean to do. AITA??(Edit: I honestly didn't mean to laugh, I don't know why I did.)

I guess it's just some (at least to me) harmless quirk I have.So whenever I am at a store where they want your name I say it's Tom, that's literally the name I use, nothing inappropriate or outlandish just plain Tom. I know I am meant when they call it as I always use the same one so there is no confusion or anything, they yell Tom I get my drink/food and it's never been a problem till now.A couple days ago I was at Starbucks with my new gf and ordered our drinks while she sat down, I gave them my fake name as always and when our order was ready and they shouted Tom I went and got it. My gf was a bit confused and asked me if I went and got someone else's order which is fair enough so I explained the thing to her and thought that's that but she got really angry.She says it's really disrespectful to lie like that and that I am making everybody in the store out to be creeps who will do something bad if they know my name which is not at all what's happening I just don't like when they yell my real name so I found a harmless way to get around that.

	"title" : "AITA for leaving itemized tips to compensate for my wife's behavior?",
	"body" : "My wife and I (in our 30s) dine out every once in a while but not too often because of my wife's annoying habit, inherited from her family. She always complains, sends food back if it's not absolutely perfect, and makes needless requests/substitutions (she doesn't have allergies or sensitivities). It can easily take 5 minutes for her just to order her own food and sometimes I've already finished my meal by time she gets her food because she sends it back, asks for modifications, etc. I know restaurant staff don't appreciate it. I've tried talking to her about this but she doesn't see an issue with it.Anyway, we make decent money and we use our combined fun funds on dates/dinners. I recently started writing what my wife does on the receipt and then calculating a tip (in addition to the normal gratuity) to compensate. So, to a receipt I might add:-  Complained about not having ___ beverage, +$5- Asked 5 questions about a single menu item, +$5- Asked for new drink because too much ice, +$5- Sent meal back, was exactly what she ordered, +$5She didn't notice me doing it the first two or three times but last night she noticed I was spending a lot of time on writing a tip amount and asked why. I showed her what I wrote. She's been mad at me since, saying I'm embarrassing her to the staff. I told her she's embarrassing us both.AITA? Petty, maybe, but an AH?ETA: My wife is otherwise a very nice, caring and generous person. She does always say please and thank you even for her most absurd requests. Annoying each other like this is our love language, but this time she's pretty mad. Oops.UPDATE: Alrighty friends, we've had our laughs and shared our perspectives. Since my wife frequents this subreddit I went ahead and showed her this post. With that said I'd like to address a few things:First, she and I both know that any posts on this sub are peepholes into people's lives and characters, not display cases. Yes my wife's behavior when dining out is bad which is why I tried to think of a way to point it out and make up for it. That said, she's not a bad person. Learn to separate the two and you'll get far in life.Secondly, when I say she was (lol... is) mad at me I don't mean that she is deeply hurt and distraught. She's calling me an asshole, yes, but that's normal for us. If this was something that was actually hurtful to her, I wouldn't be sharing it online.Anyway, she would like for you all to know that she is taking your responses to heart and she is going to be more mindful of how she dines. She would like to add that she didn't think it was a big deal before because, as she puts it, she doesn't think twice about meeting expectations in her line of work, even if they are above and beyond the norm, she's just happy to meet demand, but she recognizes that not everyone feels that way. She's going to try to be a better customer.She said reading this was brutally eye-opening but we both also found some laughter and had a good discussion.",

	"body" : "My (54M) daughter (19F) is living with me this summer before heading to college later this month. She spent the majority of her middle and high school years at her moms due to divorce custody arrangements.My daughter had knee surgery at the end of July to fix a torn ACL. As a result, I’ve been with her a lot helping her recover (food, icing, transportation, etc).Last week, I noticed in the hallway bathroom that she uses, that there were tampon “covers/wraps ” (I don’t know the official name).The next time I checked on her I asked her to confirm that she was throwing her tampons away and not flushing them. She said No, they get flushed down the toilet. She said I should be kind of embarrassed that I have a 19yo daughter and don’t even realize that. I told her No they don’t. I reminded her of all the doctor office and hospital bathrooms where reminder notes are left asking women not to flush their feminine hygiene products. At the same time as I said that, she finished looking on her phone and I could tell she found information on-line that confirmed the garbage is the correct disposal method. I asked her to please use the garbage from now on.Later that night, I sent her two different Internet searches, confirming not to put tampons down the toilet, and instead to put them in the garbage.Several days later, when I was checking on her, I asked her if she was using the garbage for her tampons. She said No. I reminded her what we talked about and what I had asked her to do. She said I didn’t understand, since I was a man. I told her, yes, I am a man and yes, I don’t understand. However, millions of American women have figured it out.  I asked her if she had googled how to dispose of bloody tampons? She said I’m not going to Google that. I asked her if she had thought about using plastic bags to wrap her tampons in, or using something like that. She said again that I wouldn’t understand what it’s like to dispose of a bloody tampon. I agreed with her again. I said it sounds like you are not willing to try or learn something new in order to do it differently. I told her if that was the case then she could pay the plumber bill if I ever needed to call the plumber to come fix a clogged drain line due to a tampon. She basically gave up and said Fine. As I was leaving she said that I was being “just like mom”.AITA?PS - I know how this sub works, so expecting some questions. I’m driving for the next four hours and won’t be able to reply until much later. Judge away!Edit 1 - stopped at Pilot rest stop. Going to respond to just a few questionsIn the USAThere is a garbage can in bathroom. Directly underneath the toilet paper (both in arms reach of the toilet)No lid on trash can. Thanks for suggesting.Edit 2 - when my daughter says I’m just like her mother, I think that is meant to be a “you’ve said the rule and regardless of what I say you aren’t going to change your mind.  You won’t listen to me and change your view”Also, I think her issue with me is that I couldn’t understand what it’s like to deal with the bloody tampon since I’m a man.Edit 3 - Thanks for all the input! I'll ask my daughter about a covered garbage can in the bathroom as well as gloves and/or small plastic bags. No dogs in the house.",

She wanted me to play it but I initially declined since I'm not into visual novels or reading long stories but after she begged, I gave it a try and played for a good 15 mins. Now I can tell she put in a lot of effort in the writing and the art and it was a good start but I just got tired of reading and stopped. She asked what I thought and wanted me to eventually finish it and tell her what I thought about the choices and the endings but I told her I had no plans to. She looked shocked and asked if it was boring, I told her no, it's just that I'm just not into this type of genre and she knows im not into reading but asked me to make an exception this time since she made it. I got upset because I think she is being childish and wants to blackmail me into doing something I don't want. After I made it clear I wasn't continuing, she hasn't talked to me. I already know that she is talented and smart so just because I don't want to play it doesn't mean I dont support her. Some of my friends agree she's being immature but others think I should be more supportive. So AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for not giving my engagement ring to dead fiancé family?",
	"body" : "Deleted account, because my new job friends knows my usual account & they don’t know about me used to be engaged.Dead fiancé name “John” & I’ll start at the beginning, about 4yrs ago.I was engaged to John, after dating for 4yrs. When he proposed, the ring he used was 2 sizes too big. We went to the store, that he bought it from (2 weeks before proposing) & he kept the receipt. Gotten the right size & kept same style. We did plan to have to wedding, after 3yrs of planning & saving. 10 months after the proposal, John passed away in a car accident. I used the savings for wedding to pay for his funeral.The day after the funeral, John’s brother came to me asking for the ring. I asked why, his response was that the ring had been passed down their family for 5 generations. Told him that was BS, because I have proof of the ring was brought for me, less than a year ago. We argued for a bit & he then stormed out. Then I get the calls from john’s family, saying I’m a liar & demanding the ring. Then I got a letter from their lawyer, in the letter they also demanded that I reimburse them for costs of John’s funeral. So I got myself a lawyer, showed the proof, about the ring & I paid for the funeral, in court & I won.I thought that madness was over, until john’s sister recently messaged me. She & her BF are engaged, but haven’t gotten a ring & she wants John’s ring. After I said no, she went crazy & messaging non stop demanding. I have blocked her over & over, but she finds a way around it. I was having brunch with my friend, my mobile was on the table, a message from sister popped up & my friend saw it. My friend knows about everything, before sister’s 1st message. I explained about her messages, friend believes I’m AH & I should give her the ring. She told my other friends & they are all saying the same things. Now I’m doubting myself.So AITA?Edit to add-Thank you all for your support. I didn’t expect that this post would have so much attention. I’ll try to reply to all your comments. I’m adding more info, as requested & to answer the repeated questions.Extra info about the ring - this ring is part of a company, that designs jewellery based on movies & mass produce each style in different sizes, this company started after 2000. When we went to the store to get right size, John asked for ring 1 to be swapped with right size & same style ring 2. If he did modify ring 1 with any family diamonds, he would have asked for ring 1 to be resized. After the swap & when telling his parents about the engagement. I showed them the ring and John told them about where he brought it & about size swap. Parents never said anything about an heirloom ring & family diamonds. It was after the funeral is when they started saying their great great great grandparents were the ones that brought this ring & it’s a heirloom.Extra info on funeral costs - John’s parents messaged me about not being able to afford the funeral. My thoughts at the time was the reason they couldn’t afford is because sister is about to start college & put the wedding fund for good use, because the wedding isn’t gonna happen anymore. I paid for everything for the funeral, the parents didn’t pay at all. I guess during my grief/shock of John’s death, might have made me forget that his family owned most of the business & housing accommodations in town. It was during court that I found out that he had life insurance, that money went to his parents & it was 2x the cost amount of his funeral.Extra info about court - when I received their lawyer letter, I thought it might be fake. But I call my friend (who is a lawyer), I explained the situation to him & asking him to check if this letter is real or fake. He told me to meet him with the letter and all my documents for the ring & funeral. He said the letter is real & he will help me. I did thought that after their lawyer see my proof, that be the end of the madness. But next thing I knew, we are in court. Most of the time I was confused, but I just spoke the truth & showed all my proof. The judge awarded me to be reimbursed for funeral costs, legal fees & emotional distress.Reason why John’s sister wants the ring - In her 1st message asking for the ring, she said that John would want her to have it, it would feel like John is part of her next step in her life & let his spirit know he is not forgotten.Sister knows that the ring was brought by John, because she was at the engagement party. at the party, we told everyone how the proposal went & about swapping rings, due to size issue. I should have mentioned that the ring is LOTR themed & we were planning on LOTR themed wedding, because we met at an LOTR event. I recall sister telling john to change the ring to Disney theme, her protests of our theme idea & saying Disney wedding instead, during the engagement party.to explain why my friends think sister should have the ring. The friend from brunch, who saw the messages from sister & told the others about this, read sister’s 1st message asking for the ring. Friend believes these a good valid reasons from sister. Friend also believes that the ring should actually be used, not stuck in a box somewhere or most likely lost. I pointed out that I do use the ring, I wore it during engagement, court madness with his family & kept it on for an year after won the case. Then only wearing the ring on his birthday and  anniversary of our 1st meeting, when he proposed & when he died. Friend called me a sad selfish AH & stormed off. Next thing I know, my other friends started messaging me about me being an AH & sister should get the ring.After the sister’s recent messages, I have called my lawyer friend, I sent him screenshots of her messages & we got a meeting this week. I am also rethinking my friendship with the friends, that says I’m AH & should give the ring to sister. So after this, I’ll update you all. Thank you very much for your support.",

	"title" : "AITA for telling my friend that my sex life has nothing to do with her?",
	"body" : "My friend “Olivia” (25F) has been living at the home of my partner (30M) and I (26F) for about a week (edit: made a mistake there, actually a few weeks)  as she has had some financial problems and was evicted from her own home. That’s fine, she cleans up after herself, she’s respectful of house rules, etc.Anyway, she pulled me aside a couple days ago and asked me if I’m really dating my partner, or if we’re just pretending. I asked her what put that in her head and she said that he and I never do couple-y things like kissing or PDA or etc. She also brought up the fact that we don’t share a bedroom and asked if everything was okay in our sex life.I am asexual, and so is my partner. My friend is not aware of this as I have not come out to anyone about this, but still… it’s a weird question to ask, is it not? Also it’s ludicrous to me that she went to the conclusion of my partner and I being in a fake relationship.I said everything was fine and it’s really none of her business. She dropped it but then yesterday she brought it up again, saying she was concerned because I seemed quite defensive and snappy when she brought up my sex life in the prior conversation. I’m not always aware of my tone of voice, I have alexithymia and autism so I’m not very good at reading/recognising emotions in myself, so I could well have come across as defensive without realising but I don’t know.She then went on, saying she wanted to continue the conversation and asking if I was “waiting till marriage?” And whether or not my religion was forcing that as she noticed I didn’t seem happy about discussing it with her the last time she tried to so it might be a difficult topic for me.I said that she was correct I didn’t want to talk about it with her because, again, it’s none of her business, so I would appreciate it if she stopped trying to.She told me I was being rude when she was just looking out for me and the least I could do was appreciate her support. She has been a victim of Christian purity culture, so I understand she was trying to help or to make sure I was okay, but I don’t appreciate her still trying to talk to me about it after I told her I didn’t want to.AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for not sharing my inheritance with the rest of my “family”?",
	"body" : "My family situation is messy. I (25F) was engaged four years ago to my high school sweetheart.  My fiancé cheated on me with my sister (28F).  We had never had a good relationship even as kids, so after I found out, I went scorched earth both of them. She was “so in love” with my fiancé, but he dumped her within two weeks and was back trying to get me to forgive him (I didn’t). My parents were initially on my side, but my sister had a nervous breakdown after she was dumped and was hospitalized so they changed their tune to “it’s over now and you can’t be mad for ever”. So I dumped them, too, and went to grad school on the other side of the country.My grandfather was livid with the whole thing, disowned my sister, and chewed out my parents. Sometimes it felt like he was the only one who was on my side and understood. I was able to get my job to let me work remotely and moved back to take care of him when he got sick last fall and I was devistated when he passed a couple of months ago. I had been in limited contact with my parents since I came back mostly because I didn’t want to be an obstacle to my dad seeing my grandfather, but with the understanding that any discussion of my sister or what happened would end that.It turns out that my grandfather left me virtually everything. He left enough for my father to cover a debt and some token stuff for a couple of other relatives, but he wrote a letters for everyone and did a video tape with his attorney explaining what his intentions were. I knew that he had done well for himself, but he lived a pre simple lifestyle so I didn’t realize how much money and assets he really had. I would give it all up to have my papaw back but even after taxes it is set for life money.My parents are pretty mad about it. One of the reasons stated for cutting them out was how disappointed my grandfather was with how they had treated me growing up vs my sister and over the fiance debacle. There were other reasons, but that’s what they’re fixated on. The will is pretty airtight apparently, so my parents want me to “do the right thing” and share it equally between me, them, and my sister. Their argument is that I don’t need it. I make more than both of them combined and this would allow them to retire. My sister is not doing great and can’t hold a job, so this would ensure she has something for when my parents pass.I don’t want to. My grandfather’s wishes were crystal clear, and also I kind of don’t feel like doing more than the minimum for any of them. They’ve been telling me that I’m being vindictive because of a mistake years ago. I can’t deny there might be a little vindictiveness there. I don’t want them to suffer necessarily, but I also don’t feel like they deserve my help.",

	"body" : "I feel like this is entirely ridiculous. I live with my roommate \"Matt\". We used to be pretty close friends, but over the last 2 years of living with him, we've drifted apart, and I'm just waiting for our lease to move out on my own.Matt's girlfriend \"Sarah\" pretty much lives with us, despite not paying rent. I won't lie, she annoys me to no end. She's an entitled airhead who thinks the world revolves around her. Anyway, Satah has a \"condition\" where she gets nauseous at the slightest smell and sight of certain foods. She's an incredibly picky eater and anything outside of corndogs or chicken tenders make's her nauseous according to her. Well unfortunately for her, I like to cook. I love heavily spiced foods and love to cook Asian-style dishes. So, living with a toddler who can't stand the smell really sucks.Sarah has always complained about me cooking \"smelly\" foods and has asked me to stop or do it when she's \"not home.\" Well, considering she doesn't pay rent and spends 18 hours a day at my home I have not accommodated her at all. Last night, Sarah and Matt sat me down and told me I need to stop cooking because Sarah cannot stand it anymore. Apparently, she had a mental breakdown last week when I was cooking curry. She claims I am making our apartment a \"hostile environment\" by ignoring her concerns. I told both of them to piss off until Sarah starts paying her share of the rent. Matt said that because he lives here his opinion matters as well and he wants me to stop. I told him no to that as well because he's only doing this because Sarah is being a baby.We ended up having a massive argument, and neither of them is talking to me both are staying at Sarah's mom's house right now. I say good riddance, at least I did until I told the story to my co-workers and they are all shocked. They say I am being a complete a-hole.

I only have high school level education.The plan for my daughter was to find a boy from a nice family for her to marry, and not go to university or to go to a local one if she wanted to.I convinced my husband that these days boys from good families want an educated woman for status reasons even if she does not work and that if our daughter had a western degree she could marry into an elite family. It worked and he paid for her to attend a top university which she got into which is actually better than the one my son went to.My daughter after leaving also confided to me that she does not believe our religion anymore and started living a different lifestyle, one I can never have.

A couple of years after she died I learned my dad had cheated on her with his wife and that my half sister was the product of the affair and born before my parents divorce was finalized. I was too young to realize when it was all going on. After learning this I had a hard time being around my dad. I remember my mom being sad and it made sense why. I also learned that he had told my mom in a really cruel way. How I found out is I eavesdropped on a fight between dad and my uncle and aunt (my mom's siblings) and heard it all, including how much my dad hated how \"boring\" my mom was. I remained distant from him, his wife and my half siblings ever since (I have two more half sisters and a half brother).My dad decided to tell the oldest of my half siblings about the cookbook. He mentioned how much I valued it and all kinds of stuff. She wanted to share it with me, to cook from it, and to get to write in it like I will some day. She pestered me about it and every time I told her no. Then her parents would tell her more about it. In the end she was upset and sobbing over being told no.

I told her \"well sorry but I'm not your parents, don't expect hand outs from me\".

	"body" : "I (29f) was pretty much disowned by my entire family when I came out at 18. My parents gave me five minutes to grab my things before shutting me outside. I remember telling them that there was no way I could live on my own, that I was their kid and they should want to love and support me. My father told me that I made this bed myself by “choosing” my lifestyle, so I should grow up and learn to lay in it.I turned out pretty okay all things considered. I was able to go to college on a few scholarships and not too many loans. I met my wife during our freshman year and I’ve been with her ever since. We have a 2yo daughter who is the most precious little person in the world, we bought a house, and we both have decent paying jobs. I consider myself to be incredibly lucky and I can’t imagine my life without my wife and our daughter.I don’t keep in touch with my bio family, so I don’t know how my parents got my contact info but they did. My mom sent me a message detailing the financial issues they were going through. They had to sell the house I grew up in and they moved to some apartments. At the end of the message, my mom asked me if I’d be willing to help them out for a little while by letting them stay with me.I didn’t respond to the message, I just planned on pretending like I never saw it, but then I got a call the other day and as soon as I answered it, I realized my dad was on the other line. He told me the same thing my mom did and that they needed help. I said “that really sucks, I hope you figure it out.”He then flat out asked if I was seriously not going to provide them with any assistance. I asked why he wanted my help and he told me that I should want to support my parents the way they supported me growing up.I replied saying that maybe if their “support” of me hadn’t ended the moment I told them I was a lesbian, I’d be willing to help them, but unfortunately they made their bed themselves so they can lay in it too. I hung up on him and later he left a voicemail calling me selfish and cruel for using their financial struggles to prove a point.Maybe it is cruel. I don’t know.Edit: I sent my mom an email with a bunch of links to soup kitchens, food pantries, housing assistance, etc. and then I blocked both her and my dad. I might change my number if they try calling again but for now I'm gonna leave it as is.",

	"body" : "I’m 45 M and I have a niece who is 22 and just got married last weekend. The family is blowing up with drama right now because of what I (and my wife) did. I must preface this by saying my family can be pushovers, they really all hate conflict and will definitely let themselves be run over by someone else in order to not cause a fight. I am not this way.The wedding was on Saturday. Catholic ceremony in a church that was at 3:30 PM. The reception area was at a brewery about 15 minutes from the church. The reception was set to start at 5. Maybe this was stupid on the venue people, but they wouldn’t open the bar or bring around the appetizers until the bride and groom arrived.Service ended around 430 and everyone was told to go to the reception. The wedding party had a limo to take them and a separate limo took the parents, grandparents, siblings. The couple is young and decided against family in the wedding party lol. It was 4 sorority sisters and fraternity brothers on each side.  My wife and I drove. We got to the venue around 4:50 with the first family limo arriving around that time. By 5 I’d say all 150 guests were there..but no bride and groom. The wedding coordinator was getting pissed as it’s now 5:45 and no wedding party. We are all just standing around with no food or drinks.Someone was able to get ahold of the MOH around this point and apparently the bride and groom told the limo driver to stop at a liquor store and then drive around on the highway for an hour so the wedding party could get trashed. At around 6 the MOH said they should be arriving in the next 20 minutes.My wife and I looked at eachother and said we are out. We thought it was horribly disrespectful for them to do that to all their guests. I told my brother (FoB) that we were leaving and taking the gift with us. He tried to plead by saying “they’re just kids let them have fun” but I was having none of it.A few days after, I got an apology text from niece followed by an ask for the gift again. I said that I felt very disrespected and I didn’t want to give a gift anymore. She snapped and called me an asshole.",

For my stepdaughter's birthday he'd usually get a cake from the bakery. This has been the case since her mom passed away. I thought I'd bake her a birthday cake for her 12th birthday that was last week as a gesture to show some motherly love and support. Jeff agreed and he told me what his daughter's favorite flavors are and what she likes and so on. I baked the cake in the flavor she likes and the icing she likes but one thing was missing and that is the blueberries and I couldn't include them because I went to the nearest store and they didn't have them. I was running out of time and couldn't get them so I ended up just leaving the cake as it thinking it wouldn't be a big deal.The party started and Jeff was busy taking care of everything else. He then came into the kitchen and asked to see the cake before bringing it out. I showed it to him and he got so angry when he saw that there were no blueberries on top. He went on and on about how I didn't fully commit to making the cake and that he trusted me to take care of it and just basically saying that he should've just ordered one from the bakery. We got into an argument and he ended up taking it and throwing it in the trashcan. I was stunned as he said \"you know what? Forget it, I'll get one from the bakery\". I blew up and screamed at him, he told me to stop but I went upstairs, got dressed and left. He tried getting me to stay but I refused and went to my parents'.He later called and then texted about how I overreacted and hurt him and my stepdaughter by leaving. Also said that I created this situation by not \"properly\" making the birthday cake just cause I didn't put blueberries on top. I refused to respond but my parents say he was justified since he must've felt pressured from the stress of making his daughter happy on her birthday.He keeps trying to speak to me but I don't respond.

It’s relevant to mention that I really dislike parties and large gatherings, I’m not sociable at all and I really just dislike them. So it was kind of a downer when I heard that Alan and Helen were going to have a wedding with around 150 people. I told Alan ahead of time that I would probably leave early and that me and the rest of our family would take two cars so that they could stay if they wanted to. He looked like he didn’t mind at the time. So at the wedding itself, after the ceremony I basically told him that I was glad and it looked great but I was going to go home. He asked if I was going to at least stay for cake or for food but the food didn’t look all that appetizing to me so I told him I was just going to leave. He said “alright whatever just go” and I went back to my table to get my stuff. I told my wife and she said she didn’t feel comfortable driving back alone (the venue was very far from us and the roads there were not great). I said in that case she should come with me and after some hemming and hawing she agreed. So we left.Then two days later Alan’s new wife bombarded me and my wife with messages that she was disgusted with us, saying horrible things about us and insulting us as people and as parents. Really just sickening. I told her off and asked why she thought it was okay to talk to her in laws like that and she said that us leaving “ruined” the wedding for Alan and that he was very upset for the rest of the night. She continued to berate us. I politely told her to leave us alone and called Alan, mainly to inform him that his wife had a temper that he should know about.When we talked about it he basically started berating me too and said things like “you always do this” and “just leave me alone” before hanging up. I feel like I’m justified since I told him ahead of time that I wasn’t going to stay. AITA here?Edit since so many people care about the details: Yes there was a mother son dance planned.

My wife was emotional gave her a big hug, and told her how proud she was. I on the other hand did not react to her coming out. I honestly did not care about that part. I was honest her partner was cool, and she was very interesting.My wife told me I was rude for ignoring our daughter's announcement. I told my wife, that I did not care who she was attracted to all I cared about was if she was happy. I tried to explain I did not care about that stuff, people like who they like I don't need labels for that. Love is love.She said my view is slightly homophobic because it shows I am not acknowledging a different view. I do not see it that way, am I the asshole should I apologize to my daughter and her partner?Edit: For added context, I did not treat her situation as any different from her brothers. I took the time to get to know the person they were with.My wife feels I should have treated it differently because they are different situations, ignoring that fact does not help.Update: Thanks for the input, everyone is right I should have just asked my daughter. I will see if she is free tomorrow for some coffee and have a chat with her. I am sure my wife's words just got to me, but only one way to find out right?Thanks again.Update: Since it always bothered me when people would ghost on threads without giving updates.Did not have much time with my daughter she had a prior engagement but we had some coffee. We spoke about the evening, as I suspected she did not have an issue with it, and she also felt it was self-explanatory when she introduced her girlfriend--she corrected me since I said partner they view each other as girlfriend and girlfriend.The coming out was more so her girlfriend's idea and my daughter said she was going to reach out because while she had no issues with my reactions her girlfriend thought it was weird how I kind of brushed off the response and treated this situation as if they were a straight couple.My daughter did try to explain that is just the person I am. Explained how she preferred my nonreaction verse making it a big deal. She told the story of how she came to me first when she had her first period because she knew my wife would make a huge fuss over simple biology.I told her I made an AITA post and we laughed over some of the comments. We are going to arrange another date and this time we will have a more special event for the sake of her girlfriend. Since she did feel slightly offended by being treated as if they were a straight couple.My daughter had no issues overall, but I will correct course. She was slightly disappointed I did not make a dad joke about her coming out. I did express that my love for her would never change, and I told her I hoped she did not wait so long because she thought I would think differently. She just told me I never told you because it was not important to her. She knew I would not care either way.I doubt I will add more updates after this I might check in every so often. I do appreciate all the varied viewpoints, and please understand it was not my intention to marginalize the hardships LGBTQA+ face in this world, I know it may be a selfish and self-centered view but I simply treat others how I wish and want to be treated.I do hope everyone has a wonderful week.",

	"body" : "My parents divorced when I was about 7 because my dad had admitted to having an affair. My mom and I moved out of our house and into an apartment while my dad immediately moved his mistress into our house because she was pregnant with my twin brothers.My mom was devastated but she quickly picked herself up for us. She went back to school and as a result, she continued climbing up in her career. My mom adjusted better to going from a double income household to a single income and was able to contribute a substantial amount of money to my college fund.My dad on the other hand had a harder time as he now has to support a family of 4 sometimes 5 on a single income as his wife is a SAHM. My dad did not have much disposable income and so did not contribute as much to the fund.I'm going to finish school soon and I have a good shot at getting into my first choices of college.Unfortunately my brother [10M] was diagnosed with a kidney disease which has progressed to where he needs to be on dialysis. My dad is drowning in medical debt so my mom agreed he no longer needed to pay child support.The specialist had suggested a different treatment for my brother as most other treatments didn't help or stopped working and they are running out of options short of a transplant (not doable at this time). This treatment is not covered by insurance and costs a lot. My dad can't take out a loan due to debt.Dad and his wife sat me down when I was over and asked if I would be willing to let them borrow my college fund to pay off my brother's treatment. They offered to pay the money back but I knew they wouldn't be able to.I really don't want to give them the money because I know if I don't get any scholarships I wouldn't be able to go to the college I want to without going into debt myself. My future would be at risk and I know my dad wouldn't help if I needed it.In addition, the money technically belongs to my mom, I can't just give it away and I know she would refuse to give them the money.My dad and his wife are furious at both my mom and I and is trying to guilt me into it. I do feel terrible for my little brother.AITA?ETA My dad does have a second job that he works on the weekend, and his wife home schools the boys and is a full time care giver for my brother.My dad's family disowned him when the affair came to light. He did get some help from his brother and sister but they can only give so much, I do think I was his last option. His wife did not have a lot of family.Lastly, of course I would feel bad if something happened to my brother, he's just a little kid, but I would want to help him with MY OWN money and I can only do that if I start my career debt free. I Also don't want to risk my own future.UPDATESo after I called my mom she left work early and picked me up from dad's house. She took me for coffee and I explained what happened.After talking a bit she said I could either keep the fund as is and not give dad the money or we can take the money that dad had contributed and give that back to him. I told her I wanted to give dad back the money he put in.After we finish our coffee mom withdrew the exact amount dad put in over the years. Mom also matched the amount and added it to give to dad.I waited in the car while she gave dad the money and he was upset because the money wasn't enough. Mom told him that is all he's going to get from her and threatened to take him to court if he and his wife keeps harassing me.This is probably the last update as I am going low contact with dad for now.

	"body" : "For my FIL’s (58M) birthday this year, my MIL (57F) planned a weeklong trip with their four children (EDIT: my husband is the second-oldest) and their respective partners. They rented out a nice house near the beach and the cost for the airbnb was split equally between the attending couples.My husband (31M) and I (29M) drove down there this week and when we arrived in our (EDIT: pre-assigned) room, we were surprised to find two single beds. At first, we shrugged it off and figured we could simply push them against each other, but we quickly found out that the headboards of the beds were drilled to the wall. (EDIT: The headboards were attached to both the wall and the bed frame. I assume it’s to prevent renters from moving the beds and possibly damaging the flooring etc.)I asked my MIL why she had chosen a house that didn’t have enough double beds to hold all of the couples that were invited and she told me to stop making a fuss because it wasn’t that big of a deal.I then asked why she hadn’t mentioned it beforehand and she rolled her eyes at me, saying that I was overdramatic, a \"walking stereotype\" and that me not clinging to her son for a little while might be for the best.Considering she has made some borderline homophobic comments in the past (she claims they’re jokes), I was quite uncomfortable and based on her remarks, I felt like she had given the room with the single beds to the only gay couple on purpose.I said that if it wasn’t that big of a deal, surely she and her husband would be happy to switch rooms with us, but she once again told me that I should quit making a fuss and walked away from the conversation.Afterwards, my husband tried talking to his mother but he wasn’t anymore successful than I had been and at this point, I was reaching my breaking point, so I asked my husband if he’d like to spend our vacation at a hotel (as we had both taken the week off work anyway). He agreed and we booked us a room at a hotel a few towns away.My MIL has accused us of ruining her husband’s birthday and \"dividing the family\", because two of my husband’s siblings support our decision.

Two boys who are younger and a girl the same age as me. She and I got along so badly that the custody times were switched so we were not in the house at the same time because we could not get along. It all started with her taking my favorite plush animal without permission and ruining it (the eyes were gone and it got soaked which ruined the color).

	"body" : "Me (27 F) and my Husband (30 M) just got married this January, but the wedding was an absolute mess. For context, my husband “Ben” has a very close-knit family that doesn’t take well to outsiders, surprises, or change. Most family reunions and gatherings don’t allow plus-ones or spouses, just immediate family. Ben has 2 brothers and 1 sister. Each of my in-laws have wives/husbands, yet they still aren’t allowed to come to the majority of family events, so it’s fortunately not just me.Even though I cannot attend most events with his family, I still have a somewhat decent relationship with them. Before the wedding I’ve never had a major issue with them, but they’ve always been distant from me and I don’t really mind.Now, let’s talk about the wedding. The wedding was planned for New Years Day, since that was the day we met, the day Ben asked me to be his girlfriend, and the day he proposed, so that holiday has always been very special to us. Everyone agreed that New Years Day was a perfect day for the wedding, so no issues there.Unfortunately, we did have a problem with other things. Ben’s family has lots of odd traditions that they do, and over the years I’ve put up with them and embraced them. They include having a homemade sheet cake rather than a professional wedding cake, wearing all white, and having ALL of the children walk up the aisle to toss flowers rather than having ONE designated flower girl/boy. However, I wanted my wedding day to be good for the both of us, so we made some compromises. We could have the homemade sheet cake, but we both had to agree on the flavor and design, anyone could wear what they wanted (besides white), and there would be no children at the wedding. (My husband suggested that, not me) We talked to both of our family’s, and everyone agreed that these rules and boundaries were fine, (or so we thought).The day of the wedding came, and my side of the family was dressed appropriately, no children were present, everything was going great. Then, Ben’s family came. There were lots of children and babies and everyone was wearing all white. Apparently their traditions were more important than what I had to say. Only 3 people actually respected the rules set in place. The spouses of Ben’s siblings. Ben and I were mortified. We immediately kicked them out and allowed the 3 people who followed the rules to stay, but they left with their partners (which we didn’t mind).The wedding went on as normal, but it felt ruined. We ended up cancelling the post-wedding celebration after some of his family members snuck inside. After we came back from out honeymoon, we were both berated by his family members and basically “shunned” from his family. I feel guilty for not allowing them to practice their traditions. AITA?INFO: Both of our family’s are from the Midwest, and my husband says that there surprisingly isn’t a history of inc£st.EDIT:I’m shocked by these comments! For the longest time I thought my husbands family was just weird, but you guys really opened my eyes.

There used to be a treeline that provided a natural barrier between my house and any potential neighbors, so I never saw the need for curtains or blinds along with they are expensive as hell for the nice ones.Recently my neighborhood expanded and most of the treeline my bedroom was facing was cut down to build new houses. So boom, then there's a house was built right across from mine, and their window has a clear view into my bedroom.I've always been comfortable sleeping nude, and it wasn't an issue when there were no neighbors around. But not long after the people moved in the father from the house came over to my house and pretty much told me to stop being nude in front of my windows since his family can see inside my bedroom. He wasn't nice about it. But, he wasn't mean either just matter of factly like he gave me an order a fully expected it to be done like I was his kid or his employee. I was somewhat surprised but understood his concern, so I made an effort to be more mindful of my nudity when in view of the window. I stopped cleaning and making my bed before getting dressed. I'd hop out of bed walk into my closet and at least put on shorts then go about my morning chores.That being said, I still sleep nude, and I occasionally end up being visible to the neighbors for a brief moment after waking up. The father came over again, leading to an argument between us. I told him I was trying my best to be considerate, but there's only so much I can do and that it's my house and I'm not changing my lifestyle because they moved in. He threatened to call the police and said I was being a \"menace to the neighborhood\" whatever the hell that means.So, am I the asshole for continuing to sleep nude even though my neighbors can see into my bedroom?",

I immediately invited one of my Instagram friends who I have gone out to eat with on several occasions and who also enjoys taking food photos. I told my boyfriend and he's pissed that I'm not taking him and says I'm doing it out of spite—I really think I'm not? If the restaurant is giving me free food in exchange for a post, I'm gonna put more effort into the post and spend a few extra minutes making sure that I actually get very good shots, and I'd rather do it with someone who isn't going to sigh and roll their eyes through the whole thing. Also, I think it's pretty audacious of him to be actively unsupportive of an activity that hurts no one, but then also expects to benefit when it's actually successful.",

I'm a widower so I wanted to make sure that our relationship was serious before I was ok with her moving in with me and my daughter. Generally they get along pretty well. I told my girlfriend at the very beginning of our relationship that I wasn't looking for a step mum for my daughter, she's old enough that she doesn't need a \"new mom\".Last weekend I went camping with one of my mates for two days and my girlfriend stayed home with my daughter. I knew my daughter was going to a party on Saturday and I already agreed to it. But when I came back from my camping trip my daughter complained that my girlfriend told her she had to wash her make up off and do one that's less \"provocative\" before she could leave the house. I got angry at my gf and told her she wasn't allowed to order my daughter around and she wasn't allowed to prevent her from doing anything that I already agreed to. We had a huge fight and since then we barely talked. AITA in this situation?EDIT: My daughter is 16. She doesn't need a babysitter and my girlfriend isn't my daughters step mum or guardian. She's my girlfriend, that's it.",

	"title" : "AITA for forbidding my sister to meet my child and telling my wife to butt out of the situation?",
	"body" : "So the judgement is pretty much exactly as the title suggest. I will provide context tho. So I (28M) have been married to my wife for 4 years and we have a 2 year old son together. My older sister Ariel has 2 kids with her husband. She is my only sibling but we do not speak and haven’t since my wedding 4 years ago. My wife knew I had no relationship with my sister or mother whenever we got together but now it’s causing an argument.We were a pretty typical family until my mom cheated my senior year of high school with a coworker. My dad moved out immediately and I moved with him. This caused the riff between me and my sister. My sister believed since my mom was sorry and it was a one time thing (as she claimed which I don’t for a second believe) and was trying to reconcile thru the church that me and my dads refusal to speak with her was somehow wrong. I was 18 and my sister was 20. Long story but eventually my sister stopped speaking with my dad. I haven’t seen my mom since 2016 and we have only spoken once since in 2019 when she tried to invite herself to my wedding. She was not invited but my sister was out of courtesy. My sister didn’t show up and we have not spoken since. My wife knew when she married me that my only family was my dad and my cousins. She said it was okay and she didn’t care.So a few months ago my wife got a call from my sisters husband (I’ve never met him) and he said that he wanted to start mending the bridge and would like to have me come meet their kids. I said no. Well then my sister started sending pics of her kids to my wife and my wife sent pictures back. I told her multiple times I did not like this and she told me she could send pics to whoever she wants. I said that if she keeps testing my boundaries she will be a single parent really soon. That she signed up for me as is. My wife is saying it’s wrong to deprive my son of his family. I said I don’t even have a relationship with my sister or BIL so why should my kid? That doesn’t make me feel comfortable at all and I don’t even know these people. Also any pic she sends could easily be forwarded to my mom and she needed to think about that. She said she doesn’t even understand why my mom can’t meet her kid and that comment alone pissed me off because I’ve explained my family drama for years and it feels like she just ignored it. I said she really needs to think about who she wants to appease because I’m not gonna stand for disrespect of my boundaries. My dad totally agrees with me and is telling me I should start setting aside money now for a exit strategy. Because my wife’s behavior is exactly how my mom used to act and I should see the warning signs now. AITA?",

	"body" : "I (16f) am an only child and that position will be expiring in October when my parents have their second child. They were always supposed to be one and done with me, something I was aware of was partly due to them finding childcare ridiculously expensive and mom enjoying her job too much to stay home. I think another part of it they are not very natural parents and are pretty much entirely hands off. We never do anything as a family and they are not very involved in my life. They pay for stuff and that is their contribution to my life.The pregnancy was a big shock for them, and for me. I heard them discussing wtf they would do and my mom was repeatedly saying she was not going to stay at home and she was not going to take much maternity leave. That she wants to be back at work ASAP. They complained about how much it will cost to get someone to watch the baby while they work and during the summers and stuff. I heard them mention me and I was like oh hell no.They sat me down a week ago and told me they had these plans for me to watch the baby for 3-4 hours after school until they get home from work. It would involve quitting all my after school stuff and not hanging out with friends after school either. They also want me to stay home next summer and to consider hanging around to be there for the next few summers. I was like no way. They told me I am going to be a big sister now and that as part of the family I have responsibilities. I told them THEY had responsibilities as parents and I am not a parent, I am the child in their house. They told me not for long. I said I could just rush to graduation and leave so they can't use me as free childcare. I don't think they expected these reactions from me or the thought I had put into it. After I heard them talk with each other I found out I could graduate in December by talking to my guidance counselor. I'm almost finished my junior year now and could finish senior year early with the grades I keep and the work I do. That is definitely the most appealing option to me and I'll be 17 in a couple of weeks anyway.My parents were really unhappy with me and they told me I am going to miss out on so much by doing this. I told them I won't take care of or raise the baby for them. That I have my own life and being stuck with a baby is not part of it. They told me I am being incredibly selfish and to think about what I am throwing away. They also said I won't be a very good sister if I refuse to be part of the baby's life.AITA?",

I asked which school. She said she’s going to have fun with this and not tell us. I texted my wife and said she had a decision but she wasn’t telling us. My wife’s comment was we’ve spent a great deal of money with trips, airline fare, hotels, meals, etc. for all of this. We visited multiple schools last spring and after she was accepted at five, she narrowed them down to three, which we’ve now visited. Today at the airport during the layover she said she thinks it’s fun she got on our nerves about this and doesn’t plan on telling us until maybe the end of the week.

We got up to our departure city to spend the night before our flight the next morning. In the hotel room she got up and said she had a big announcement. Then she pulled t-shirts out and started whipping them out to each of us. The shirts were all from the selected school. Her mother and I each have her huge hugs and congratulations of how proud we are if her. So…happy ending.

The only major fight we have had throughout her pregnancy happened a couple days ago, and it was about what we were going to name our kid.It all started when we found out the gender of the baby. We didn’t do a gender reveal and decided to find out the gender at one of her checkups because we didn’t want to spend time making two lists of names then have to get rid of one after. So after we found out we were having a boy we sat down together and made a list. Almost all of the names she suggested were normal, until the one that caused me to write this post. She suggested we name our son Mune. She told me the name was from this movie she watched when she was younger and that it always stuck with her. I told her the name was a little out there and he would get made fun of for it. She claimed he wouldn’t and we started going back and forth trying to decide whether to add the name to the list or not. Eventually she agreed to keep the name off the list, we picked some that we liked, and I thought that was that.Later on in her pregnancy her mom decided to throw a baby shower as it was her first grandchild, and my wifes pregnancy was almost over and we hadnt celebrated once. It was fine for the most part until we started to open the gifts. Most of them were normal baby things like diapers and bottles, until we got to her moms gift. My wife opened the gift bag and pulled out a blue handmade blanket. It seemed normal enough at first until my wife unfolded it and low and behold there was the name Mune written on the blanket. When I saw it i was pissed but didn’t want to cause a scene so i stayed quiet. After that reveal I had family members come up to me and ask me about the name and why i hadnt told them. I didnt know what to tell them as i didnt have a clue about this either and just had to embarrassingly tell my family that, which pissed me off even more.Once the event ended and me and my wife went home I started to question her about the name. She got defensive and told me that it was a good name and that i was overreacting about it. I brought up the earlier points and told her it was a stupid name for a kid and if she wanted to name something Mune so bad she could use the name for a dog. She got upset and called her mom to come get her. After she left she called me and told me she wouldn’t be coming back for awhile. Everyone ive talked to about this has said im not the asshole, but now that my wife has been gone and ive been thinking about it I feel like I could have handled the situation better. Aita?",

We have quiet sections on trains and I booked my ticket specifically so I could do work on a table in the quiet section on my laptop. My friend Lea (34f) sat opposite me.A man (40s/50s) was sat next to me and about 15 minutes into the journey, starts watching Friends out loud on his iPad. I put my headphones in but it was loud enough that I could still hear it. My friend and the person sat next to her were just giving him dirty looks, but he was oblivious and munching away on his sandwich.So I said: “excuse me, would you mind turning that down just a little bit please?” He said no. Literally one word, no. Then I mentioned that it was the quiet section of the train and he laughed at me and said “are you go gonna tell on me?”It was so bizarre and annoying, but my friend just gestured for me to stay calm and leave it. So I closed my laptop and started watching with him. And commenting.“Omg I love this bit!” “Watch the next part, it’s soooooo funny.” “Oh, is this the one where X happens?” I’m not a massive friends fan but I know enough to get by.He didn’t respond, just kept giving me irritated looks but I kept going. He moved the iPad from the table to his lap, without turning the volume lower at any point. So I just carried on peering over his shoulder and commenting. He finally slammed the iPad case shut, grabbed his backpack and walked off, presumably to find another seat on the train.I opened my laptop and carried on working. After we got off, Lea said I should’ve just left it and not reacted to him, but it was a 4hr journey and I had a lot to do. I paid extra to get a table seat, that too in the quiet section. She said I could have offered him my headphones. Maybe if they were over-ear, but they’re in-ear and he’s a stranger so, no.She said I kind of invaded his personal space – I didn’t touch him or move from the confines of my seat at any point and she was like no but watching someone’s iPad is an asshole move.

They moved into my house after the marriage because I live in a better school district.

The dent is about a hands wide, starts at the front fender, and runs down all the way to the rear tire.I was furious and thought someone side swept my car as it was parked on the street. I checked our doorbell camera to see if it recorded anything and was surprised to see our 16 year old daughter sneaking out of the house in the middle of the night and driving off in my car. She later returned hours later stumbling into the house. Outside of those 2 events, the doorbell camera didn’t record anything else but a couple of passing cars that didn’t come close to mine. I angrily showed my wife the recording and told her our daughter needs to be punish but she said that she’ll talk to her. I argued that talk isn’t enough which led us into an argument. My wife argued that the new family dynamic has been hard on the kids while I argued that it doesn’t excuse the damage done to my car. I wanted her to agree to ground our daughter from social media and make her get a job to pay for the damage. We argued for hours until she said I don’t get a say in any punishment because I’m not her father.That ended the argument and I walked off.Since then I’ve checked out of any parental duties. I’ve been an adult and still make sure the kids are safe and fed but I haven’t done anything a father would do.

The rest was spent on getting to know Elizabeth and her job, interests, how she met Alison, etc. It also didn't help that she was a psychiatrist and everyone had questions. I was beyond pissed. She could've brought her home any other time but chose this one time that our parents decided to acknowledge me.So I was cold throughout the dinner. Not that anyone really cared. At the end of the night, Alison asked me why I was sulking. I told her the truth and I said she managed to make this about herself as well, that she couldn't live if the spotlight wasn't on her.She told me I should be happy for her because she's fallen in love and is extremely happy with her girlfriend and wanted her to be a part of this celebration. She knew exactly what bringing a girlfriend would do to the dinner. So I told her she could've done it literally any other night.Right now, we're still pretty distant. AITA here? Am I overreacting?",

I spent the next three months in an expensive rehab facility for troubled teens. I was by far the youngest and smallest, most of these guys were 16-18. And they weren't in there for weed, most of them did hard drugs, and had mental issues on top of that.My roommate was a 17 year old who was detoxing from meth and pills, who also had unmedicated bipolar. A few nights he'd just stare at me and not sleep. We were in our rooms 18 hours a day, everything else was meals or shitty arts and crafts. It was hell, but it worked, I was too terrified to have friends, much less do drugs.I wanted to go NC with my family at 18, but my therapist encouraged me to repair our relationship. We have a rocky one, which is why I moved out, but we've been working on healing and it's been cordial. I was over there for easter with the whole family, and my mom congradulated me.She said she was so thankful she had me sent to \"get help\" as a kid, otherwise I'd just be some junkie.

	"body" : "My BIL (married to my sister) is a general contractor. About 10 years ago, my dad and brother was building a deck at my parent’s home. They asked my BIL if they could borrow his skid loader but he said no. They prepared the ground as best they could without the skid loader but got to the point they couldn’t go on without it. They went to my sis’s house to ask again but found out BIL went out of town. They talked my sis into letting them borrow it so she took them down to his construction lot and they hooked it up to dad’s truck.This next part I’m not sure of since I don’t know much about towing but from what I was told, dad’s truck wasn’t big enough or powerful enough to tow the skid loader on the dump trailer so he lost control and wrecked. The truck, trailer, and skid loader was totaled. The insurance was barely enough to cover the medical costs and the truck. There was none left over to cover BIL’s stuff. When he got back to town, he exploded. He threaten to sue and things just went downhill from there. My parents are not rich and he wouldn’t have gotten anything so in the end, sis talked him into letting it go.However, from that day on he wouldn’t have anything to do with our family. He doesn’t come for birthdays, holidays, nothing at all. Next month is our parent’s 50th anniversary and we’re planning a big family gathering to celebrate. We’re also chipping in to send our parents on a cruise to Mexico because they’ve never been out of the country. I spoke to sis about it the other day and she said she’s coming with the kids but BIL is not coming. I was fine with that but when we were discussing their portion of the cruise money, I heard him yelling in the background to deduct their portion from the cost of the skid loader and dump trailer. That pissed me if so after my call with sis, I called BIL and told him to get over himself. I told Dad and bro made a mistake but that was 10 years ago and he needs to let it go. He said he’ll let out go when they give him the money he lost. I told him he’s an ass for holding on to a grudge and putting money in the way of a family relationship.Sis called me a few minutes ago and said they’re not coming and that I was out of line. We argued for a bit and that’s where it stands.I don’t think I’m wrong for telling him to let go of the past but they’re not coming to the anniversary party so now I’m not sure.Answers to your questions:Let’s get something straight. My dad and brother are not bad people. They are good people who made a mistake. They couldn’t pay back BIL because he wanted almost $70,000 and again, we’re not rich. Dad had to buy another truck because he needed it to go to work.On the other hand, BIL had 3 other sets of skid loaders and dump trailers on his lot that day so he could take the financial hit while my parents would be homeless. BIL and sis are way better off then the rest of us so while I understand your reasoning of paying BIL back, he doesn’t need it.The cruise to Mexico isn’t some millionaire trip. The total cost is about $3,000 and it’ll take over 20 people to pay for that. Again, we’re not rich. We can barely cover $3,000 spread out over 20 people so there’s no way we can pay $70,000.",

I told her they're old enough to not need that much help already. They can all dress themselves and pour themselves cereal and milk, there's no reason we have to be up. She says that cereal isn't a good enough breakfast, they need something more substantial, especially the 12 year old, and that the 10 year old has adhd and will definitely struggle without help in the morning and anyway she wants to see them off and kiss them goodbye for the day.

	"body" : "I (24F) have a half-sister (27F), we'll call her Taylor.My dad had weekend visitation with Taylor at our house until I was 8, and it was the worst. She bullied me really badly any time I saw her, to the point that I would scream every time my dad even mentioned her coming over. Even if we were kept apart, she would break my things, upset my pets, and tell lies about me. Every week her mom would end up in the kitchen screaming at my parents.Taylor's mom died when she was 11. Her mom didn't have any family able to take her in, and nor did my dad. My dad was the only one who could get custody. When I was told about this, I freaked out. Screaming, crying for hours, calling my grandparents and demanding to live with them, all of it. My mom wasn't willing to have Taylor in the house on that basis, and I'm pretty sure she said she would move out if my dad pushed the issue. Taylor ended up being sent to boarding school the next year, and she would go to stay with other members of my dad's family during breaks. When I was 14 my parents divorced, and I would see Taylor every few months at my dad's during school breaks. I'd learnt to stand up for myself and she'd grown up so there was no bullying, but we'd bicker - she was hostile and I never backed down. I didn't see her much after she went to college, and then I went to college far away as well.We now live in the same small city (I moved here in March). It's the kind of place where everyone from each generation knows or knows of each other. I had never encountered Taylor socially and never mentioned knowing her, but I had met her boyfriend and his friends are part of my larger social group. The other night, I was at a party, and Taylor and her bf were there as well. We made eye contact and waved, but she pretty much avoided me all night. During the night, our mutual friends asked how I know Taylor, and I said we are half sisters. They all looked super uncomfortable and I pressed for an explanation. Basically, Taylor's been telling everyone that she was homeless as a kid because her stepmother and half-sister hated her and demanded she be shipped off to boarding school and made her dad ignore her. Were it not for the fact that it was obviously going to come out sooner or later that we are related, I probably wouldn't have bothered to set the record straight. As it was, I'm going to be around these people for a long time, and I didn't feel I should have had to walk around burdened by the weight of her lies. So I told the group the context.She called me yesterday to yell at me. Apparently she's being ostracised from the group, her relationship is in trouble, her career opportunities are in jeopardy, etc. I don't see how any of this is my fault because she's the one who lied, but according to some people I should have been a bit more gentle in my retelling of the facts because it's her 'experience' and I've basically blackballed her.EDIT - I didn’t have space for this, but just to clarify what I actually said to the friends. I explained that the reason my mom didn’t want Taylor to live with us was because of the bullying, and that when they split my dad still didn’t have Taylor live with him, and that I only stayed with him on weekends (Taylor told them I moved in with my dad so that she couldn’t). I also told them it wasn’t true that I told my dad not to finance Taylor’s business when she was 20…because I didn’t. That was pretty much the gist of it.Edit 2 (it was suggested I add this from the comments): I know the answer to these.My mom didn’t say to send her to boarding school. What my mom said was, Taylor is not living in this house with my daughter, if that means we split, then we split. My dad didn’t want to be a full time parent by himself, so he stayed with my mom, and since he didn’t have any other family Taylor could live with for various reasons, he sent her to boarding school.My dad never cut contact with Taylor. He visited her at school (it was about an hour away) and sometimes he’d see her at other relatives’ places during school breaks. When he moved out, Taylor would occasional spend the day and maybe one break a year at his place.",

My boyfriend suggested that I get an outside perspective here.I (26F) was dating “James” (M26) for most of college and we had plans to get engaged after graduation. Two months before graduation, I caught him planning to cheat.  Nothing physical seemed to have happened yet, but he and another girl were making plans for a weekend that he told me he was going for a quick visit home. Cheating is an instant dealbreaker to me, so it was over. Instead of having a fight, I didn’t say anything, just waited til after he left for “home”, texted him proof that I had caught him and “good thing you’re single now, have fun”, then blocked him on everything and went for a girls weekend with friends. James lost his shit and spent a month trying to get in contact with me or guilt friends into helping him. The few messages that got through I trashed without even reading them. After awhile, I thought he had finally given up.About a year later, my sister (24F) announces she wants to bring her boyfriend home to meet the family. We didn’t realize she had a boyfriend, but my parents had a BBQ and told her to bring him. It was James. My parents were stunned but tried to pull it together.  I just left. My sister called and tried to explain later that they had met at a party on campus and it was no big deal since I broke up with him. I told her I thought she could do better, but she could make her own mistakes. I just wouldn’t be spending time around them. She got mad about it, because our parents “took my side”.I don’t get along with my sister at the best of times, so avoiding them wasn’t hard except at holidays. My parents caved and let him come to Thanksgiving and Christmas since they seemed serious. James seemed way too invested in getting back on my good side when he was around and it apparently made my sister jealous, because she started acting brattier than normal. This last weekend was a milestone birthday for my mom and I thought it would be a good chance to introduce them to my boyfriend Todd (29M). Mom gave it the ok and Todd actually made a great impression on the family. James was there with my sister and he was pissed and left early. My sister called me later and yelled at me for upsetting James and trying to make him jealous to get his attention. I told her that she knew she was getting a cheat when she decided to date my sloppy seconds and he was no longer my problem.Since then she’s blown up social media venting about it and is refusing to see my parents for the holidays if Todd and I are there. My parents think she’s over the top and acting out but she’s on their case so much they want me to try and smooth it over and apologize for calling him sloppy seconds. I think it was an apt description.Edit: Wow, this blew up a lot! After reading the replies and talking with Todd, I’m going to have a conversation with my parents this weekend and set some boundaries. I’ve reached the end of my patience with my sister so I’m going NC with her. Todd and I will be going to his family for Thanksgiving and we’ll have to figure out a plan for Christmas, maybe Christmas Eve with my parents without my sister and James, then Christmas day with his parents. It’s going to be a hard conversation, but I’m just not willing to put up with the ongoing soap opera anymore. I’ll write out a letter for my sister explaining that I need some space from her and then block her so she can’t argue and I don’t have to experience the tantrum.  Todd has been really sweet about the whole thing, and I know who I’d rather spend time around if it’s going to end up being a pissing match about who’s boyfriend can come to family events.",

There were maybe 25-30 Hispanic people with beer(glass bottles of modelo as well, double rule break, with the alcohol AND glass), loud music, and they were also using both of the grills on the patio. After investigating further it looked like one of the small families that I’ve seen around the complex was having a birthday party for their kid.Our complex technically has a rule that all non residents must be checked in at the office to use the pool, but there’s no way they enforce this and nobody really pays attention to that rule.

It doesn’t specifically say no parties but it says be respectful of others spaces and not to hog items like the grills, hot tub, umbrella tables.

I just love talking about that stuff.I'm about 15 years younger than my eldest brother and he knows about my collection.  When he got married I was 14. At his gift opening I saw he got one of her usual gifts.   I also saw his wife's face.  She was not super grateful.I made sure he knew that I thought it was beautiful but I didn't ask him to think of me if he wanted to get rid of it.  I thought he might like to pass it on to his kid one day.When my aunt passed away she left me the last of her collection.  Three pieces that were a set.I got married last September. My niece, his daughter, was my flower girl.At my gift opening I could almost hear him giggle when I opened my gift from them.  It was the piece from our great aunt.  He thought it was super funny.  Then he gave us our \"real\" gift from our registry.I thanked him profusely for both.He came over the other day and saw my collection in my china cabinet I inherited. He asked me why I was so fascinated with this stuff.  I told him that I thought it was amazing and that lots of people collected it.  He called bullshit and started looking it up.The figurine he gave me is worth about  $6,700.He said that I was a dick for not telling him what it was worth.  He wants it back.  I said  that my husband and I were going to give back every piece I got from family as a gift for a special occasion.  I already planned to give that piece to my niece for her first communion. Along with a little booklet of information about my aunt and the value of the piece so they appreciated it.  I know exactly who I got each piece from. And they are all going back to that family.He says I'm being mean accepting a gift from him that is worth so much.I asked him if he ever bothered looking up.the value of what he was giving me.   He said he thought it was like precious moments or Hummel.Whatever.  I have family treasures to keep safe for the next generation. I know I would have gotten something awesome from my great aunt if she hadn't passed away before my wedding.",

	"body" : "I (27F) am getting married in a few months to my fiance (28M). We have been planning our dream wedding for over a year, and everything is finally falling into place. However, there is one issue that has been causing quite a bit of controversy in our family.My nephew (18M), \"James\", has a service dog, \"Max\", for his anxiety and panic attacks. Max is a well-trained and well-behaved dog, and he has been a great help to James over the years. However, I am severely allergic to dogs, to the point where I could have a severe reaction if I am around them for an extended period of time. This is something my family is well aware of.When we sent out the invitations for our wedding, we made it clear that there would be a strict no pets policy, due to my allergies. James and his parents approached us and asked if Max could be an exception, as he is a service dog and not just a pet. They assured us that Max would be on his best behavior, and that he would not cause any problems.As much as I understand the importance of Max to James, I had to say no. My wedding day is supposed to be one of the happiest days of my life, and I do not want to risk having a severe allergic reaction during the ceremony or reception. I explained this to James and his parents, and I offered to help find alternative accommodations for Max during the wedding.However, my decision has caused a lot of controversy in the family. Some of my relatives believe that I am being selfish and inconsiderate, while others understand my point of view and support my decision. James is understandably upset, and I feel terrible about the situation.So, AITA for not allowing my nephew to bring his service dog to my wedding?",

I came here for support and opinions, and my shame should not be your entertainment, thank you. I know I can't stop you, but now if you link here, at least your readers will see this.Throwaway, tl;dr the title. Me, 34F. Piecing old memories together with new info I just got.dec. 2019, I tell boss I'll be quitting end of jan. 2020 to be self-employed, but boss asks me to stay on payroll so he can \"contract out\" work to me easily. On my last day, coworkers leave me a goodbye card with $1000 cash in it. March 2020, I move a few hours away.Last week (mar. 2023), I see a former coworker who pats my stomach and asks if this is \"my second\". I internally die because OH SHE THINKS IM PREGGO. I know I'm ~20 pounds over where I'd like to be, and a lot of that is on my gut, coupled with a super curved lower spine that made my belly stick out even before I got fat. I tell coworker I don't have any kids, haha, I'm just fat, she looks awkward, I feel awkward, 0/10 experience, would not repeat.This morning I get a call from HR passing on a message from a different coworker asking for the \"going away\" cash to be returned, as it was meant as a maternity gift \"for my baby\" and that me \"being fat\" and \"wearing shirts that emphasize my belly\" was deceptive and I tricked that coworker into thinking I was pregnant. HR says she overheard the convo about me leaving but continuing to do some work in the coming months and took that as my maternity leave? She took donations from the staff under that pretense and now my fatness and lack of baby-ness is The Hot Office Gossip. Feeling super great about that too. HR says they can't force me to do anything, but it would be nice to return it.Here's the thing. I no longer have the card, but I am SURE it did not say anything about \"there's a kid inside you!\" It had two pandas on the front that oh now as I'm typing I do remember there was a big one hugging a smaller one so maybe it was about babies, but it DEFINITELY didn't say anything like \"bun in the oven!\" or \"your sex was successful!\" or \"We think you're pregnant!\", I am CERTAIN I would remember that because that's a super big insecurity I've had for the past ~5 years since I started gaining weight (medicine side effect) and husband keeps saying \"nobody thinks you look preggo\" so HAHA sucks to be wrong hubby. this is a very hollow victory.I'm feeling crushed and upset that the going away gift actually wasn't, and not once did any of my coworkers actually ask if I was pregnant. I don't really want to return the money. The cash is long since gone, but I could pull 1k from my bank to give back.Old boss has also been emailed about this entire exchange- posting here while I wait for a reply from him and googling \"women's fashion to hide belly fat\" and feeling horrible about my body.",

	"body" : "I (22f) joined a hiking group a few months ago to make some new friends. There, I met this girl named Reese (23f). We share a lot of the same interests and we became pretty good friends.For the past month or so, Reese has been on the hunt for a new job since her current one has abysmal pay. She finally got an interview, but about 4 days ago, her car broke down and she had to take it to the shop. Because of this, she asked me to drive her to the interview and I agreed since her apartment and her interview site are both within 15 minutes of my apartment.On the day of the interview (2 days ago), I drove to Reese’s building and she got in the car and everything seemed okay. However, when I was pulling out of the parking lot, I noticed she wasn’t wearing her seatbelt. Since I’m uncomfortable driving people without seatbelts, I asked her to put it on, thinking she just forgot. But when I said that, she told me she doesn’t wear seatbelts. I immediately stopped the car and told her she needed to put it on and the car would not be moving while she wasn’t wearing a seatbelt. Reese got upset and said that her uncle died in a car accident because he got twisted up in his seatbelt and wasn’t able to get out of the car before it exploded, so she doesn’t wear a seatbelt for “safety reasons.” I felt terrible for her, but I stood firm and said I didn’t want to get a fine for her not wearing her seatbelt. Furthermore, if we got in an accident and she got hurt because she wasn’t wearing a seatbelt, I wouldn’t be able to live with myself.Reese only got more upset and said it was only a 15 minute drive and the chances of us getting into an accident are so low, so it doesn’t matter. She also said she’s a grown woman and I can’t control what she does. I said that’s true, but I’m also a grown woman and I can choose whether or not I want to drive my car, and if she wasn’t going to wear a seatbelt, I wasn’t going to drive her.We argued for a little bit more before I told her she can get an Uber if she feels so strongly about it. Reese called me an asshole and got out of my car and I just left.She later texted me and said that she ended up being late for her interview, and now because of me, she wasn’t going to get the job. I told her that all she had to do was put on a seatbelt and she made herself late. She responded that I wasn’t being understanding of her trauma and I’m a controlling bitch. So now I’m having second thoughts. I don’t know, should I have just bitten the bullet and driven her?",

Which made him very mad. Staff got involved and asked me to cover up for a little while. I said sure. So the next day I came in smaller shorts but with a long sleeve shirt. He was with her and lost his mind. When staff came again to talk to me. I said I had been working out like this here for years. I’ve also seen women wear a hell of a lot less.

I just keep my distance because I don’t like dealing with her.She is a horrible picky eater, I don’t know why but truly I don’t care because she is a pain at restaurants. We try to go anywhere and we have to change places multiple times so she can have something to eat. She makes the waiters go through hoops so she will have something she likes and if anything is wrong she will bitch about it or pout in the corner.Example: She got a quesadilla, removed everything on it, and when it came out she sent it back because there was sour cream on the side, it wasn’t touching anything and she mad a huge deal about her food being wrong. She doesn’t have allergies either.What really made me dislike her is that she complained about the food at a funeral, they had a sandwich spread but went on about it’s gross multiple times.So I had a dinner  yesterday and I invited everyone but my sons wife ( son wasn’t invited either but he was on a business trip). My other DIL posted it online and I got a call from DIL. She was pissed I didn’t invite her and asked why, I told her it’s due to her being an embarrassment at dinners and I won’t be inviting her to dinners. She called me a jerk and hung up.Now my son is on my ass and I am wondering if I should apologize or not.Edit: I’m going to say it, it doesn’t matter if she has an eating disorder or is on the spectrum. Both those group know how to act  at a funeral or restaurant. It may be harder but they can.Edit2. So to make it clearer, I have three DIL and one SIL, we all have a good relationship besides this one DIL (3/4) it’s not me that’s the issue here.   They don’t like her eitherAlso I find the threat of I better bend down to her or I won’t see her kids such a stupid threat.

Instead of escalating it, I just left. And when we do argue it’s not a screaming match.For how long we have dated. I’ve known her since Freshman year of high school. And got together Junior year. (Dated for 8+ years)I read some comments and decided to go talk to her tomorrow about what happened, why she did that etc.I do recognize that I didn’t pay the full amount of me and my wife’s dinner. I do take fault in that. I should have added another 50-75 dollars to make it the price of 2 people.

I'm not a great cook, but I'm sociable and enjoy being the hostess. When H has friends over to watch soccer, I prep a huge tray of snacks, keep the beers on ice, and pop in with drink and food top ups during the game.

I do my best to dress nicely when they're round, so I figured it would be a pretty dress or something. He had this huge grin on his face so I was SO excited.

The kids enjoy having one big sleepover with their cousins, my mom likes having everyone home again. We all pitch in. It’s a win win.Last year, my brother married “Sally”. She has a 7 year old daughter, “Mindy”. This was their first Christmas with us. It seemed like they were having a fun time. Christmas Eve, all the kids went to the finished basement to sleep. We told the kids to not open up gifts without us and to wake us up when they did. This was repeated several times. Once the kids were asleep, we put all the gifts under the tree and eventually went to bed ourselves.The next morning, around 6 AM, I wake up early and head downstairs. I find the living room a mess. Half of the gifts were unwrapped. Several of them had been ripped from their boxes. There was Mindy, playing with some of the toys. Most of the ones weren’t even hers. She knows how to read and they were all labeled, so she knew this. I was in shock. I went and got my brother, Sally alongside the rest of the adults. Sally was super embarrassed. My mom was very upset.The other kids weren’t up yet, so we tried to salvage what we could while Sally talked to Mindy. Not everything could be fixed and she had broken a couple of toys completely. The broken ones weren’t even her own toys. Luckily, not everything was damaged and even the boxes that were, the kids didn’t notice. But my nephew (sister’s son) had one of his big gifts destroyed and he was sad when everyone else got theirs while he was told he’d have to wait for a new one to come back in. Sally and my brother reimbursed everyone. Mindy didn’t get to open gifts with everyone but joined the festivities later. She apologized, but kept making excuses. She said she didn’t want to wait and she wanted to see what everyone else got.We’re all preparing to go to my parents’ again this year. I put in the group chat that we should either lock the door to the living room this year or put a gate around the tree so no one can get to it. I didn’t even name names, just specifically said “no one”. Sally and my brother got mad, accusing me of treating Mindy like a baby or an animal. I said I’m not, but this is a precaution so none of the kids are tempted. They said this isn’t necessary and I’m holding a mistake over Mindy’s head. I said no, I’m not, I’m trying to make sure we have NO repeat.Because I know it’ll be asked: Mindy doesn’t have autism or ADHD and even if she did,  my daughter has ADHD and both my sister’s kids are on the spectrum. They knew better. I don’t think Mindy was malicious. She was only 6. But I do think precautions should be made. My parents agree with me and my brother is mad that I put it in their heads.AITA?",

My husband is on board with this idea, believing it would contribute positively to the boy's personal growth.I expressed to my husband that I have reservations about having him live with us, based on observations during the weekends he spends at our place:Firstly, he appears to have a strained relationship with my younger son. He rarely includes him in activities unless I specifically prompt him to do so. When I ask him to assist the younger boy, such as accompanying him to the bathroom, he does so with obvious reluctance.Secondly, he displays an excessive competitive streak towards my older son. He consistently aims to outperform him and even taunts him when he succeeds. I find this overly competitive atmosphere uncomfortable. I desire my children to grow up in a nurturing and supportive environment.The third and most significant concern is his academic and behavioral performance. My boyfriend has informed me that his son has been struggling academically and has faced minor behavioral challenges. I am concerned about his potential negative influence on my children, particularly my older son.My husband dismisses these concerns as typical for his age, believing that with our guidance, he could improve. I sought advice from my mother, and she disagrees with me, asserting that providing a united family environment could greatly benefit my stepson. Both of them label my reasons as unreasonable.AITA?EDIT: Many people didn't quite catch the bathroom example I provided. Let's say we're at a park, I can't let my 5-year-old go to the bathroom alone. So, I might have my stepson accompany him for safety reasons. It's the kind of thing an older child should do for a younger one.Update: I know that I am not the best person, but I never mistreated or ignored my future stepson. I care for him, and I would never think of hurting him. I realize now that I was being overly protective of my own children and not considering things from my future stepson's perspective.  I was afraid that my future stepson might bully my kids (for example, excluding the younger one from activities he enjoys, like building with Legos, or teasing the older one when he wins), but now I can see that if he wants to live with us, it's because he cares about his future siblings.Moreover, as a responsible adult, I understand that I have an obligation to help him with behavior and school grades.I talked to my boyfriend, and I accept that he can come live with us. Now, we'll need to move to a new house so that each child can have their own room, and we'll have to work on getting custody.",

I also believe shes in a toxic relationship with her current boyfriend.My nieces and nephews, along with my other kids are all happily married, some starting their own families.It was my sisters birthday recently, and she and her husband had planned the trip for the family. She helped with expenses if needed but for the most part everyone payed for themselves.My daughter was the only one going by herself.We did things as family, but there were times when we split up to do something with just our partners. So sometimes my daughter was by herself or basically being a third wheel.At the end of the trip my daughter complained to me how she hated going on the trip. That she felt like it was a cruel joke that she was there by herself, and that the others should not have show affection to their partners when she was around. This is not the first time she complained about something like this, she’s done it after holidays and birthdays as well.I’ll admit i’m tired of my daughter complaining about this. So I told her that just because her life isn’t going well doesn’t mean others will stop living theirs. She hasn’t talked to me since, and that was almost two weeks ago. My husband is on my side but i’m worried i’ll lose my daughter.

	"body" : "I (35f) have owned our home since before marriage, and we have a prenup. In day to day life we refer to it as our home, but my husband (37m) has never paid anything towards it and has no legal rights to it.All of our parents are still alive, but my husband and I were both the youngest children, and our parents are all much older.His mom has some dementia, and his dad has some major mobility issues. They can no longer stay in their home. Due to mil wandering the street recently, adult social services have been involved. He has two siblings, one is an addict and is in prison. The other has four kids and lives in a two bedroom apartment. Neither of his siblings can take them in, so it’s us or a nursing home.Both of my parents are older, and have recently retired. They live in a major city, but can’t afford to live there on just retirement. They need to move. My older brother is dead so it’s just me that my parents can rely on.I want to move my parents in with us. They’re both easygoing people and my husband gets along with them well. They also can contribute to the household finances. They wouldn’t be a burden on us at all. My husbands parents just live off social security and are going into debt because of their medical costs. They would be a major burden on us, we’d have to take care of them and provide for them full time. My husband works much longer hours than I do so I’d be responsible for them. My in laws also aren’t very appreciative people, and I don’t like them.I mentioned that I want to move my parents in with us and we could use they money we’d save from their financial help to put his parents in a decent home. He was furious. He thinks we should take his parents in and my parents can just move somewhere cheaper and manage their own retirement funds fine. I don’t think this is reasonable at all, I expressed that he doesn’t have time to look after his medically needy parents, nor can he afford in home health care. He said as his wife I should look after his parents out of love for him. I think his response is kind of bullshit tbh.I told him under no circumstances will his parents be moving in, and he’s welcome to move out and care for them elsewhere. I told him if he decides to stay I’ll respect his decision of not wanting my parents to move in, and I can look into other options for them.AITA for not being willing to let my i laws move in but wanting my own parents to move in?Update/edit: I spoke to my husband for an hour about it. I think he thought I would cave but I’m not. Our marriage is done. And honestly, I’m okay with it. I bring a lot more to the table, and I’m ready to be with someone who’s an equal partner. Certain aspects of his culture I admire, but the relentless idea of sacrificing everything so your parents are comfortable is something I don’t agree with. They’ve always treated me poorly and I’m not willing to sacrifice for them.My husband packed some clothes, and is going to stay on his friends couch for a while. I’m going to move my parents in later this month, and I’m going to change the locks and move his stuff out to a storage unit tomorrow. He can’t afford a lawyer so I’ll find one to represent us both, and that’ll be it.I don’t know what he’ll do about his parents, and I don’t care. He doesn’t make enough to pay for their care, so they’re probably going to go to the only nursing home in the area that works with Medicare. It’s a truly awful place rampant with abuse and neglect, which does suck for them. But they treated me like shit so, that’s life I guess.Edit pt 2: a lawyer can’t represent us both apparently, and can only mediate us both. Shitty but whatever. I’ll get myself a one and if he can’t come up with the money I’ll get whoever’s cheapest ig",

Peggy’s father also put up 5k.I told my son this and he told me outright it wasn’t going to be enough. He said “I don’t mind, I figured that me and Peggy would have to pay for some of the wedding”.

I said My own wedding, after haggling and deals, only came out to around $7k so I do not think this is an issue. He argued against me and said that my wedding was 40 years ago and prices were different. He outlined some prices and said the cheapest venue he could find was $5k, and food alone was going to be $2,5k.He again said he didn’t mind and he thanked me for giving them money for the wedding but I honestly felt hurt that he thought we were not giving enough. I said how could food come out to 2500 dollars and he said that that was only around $25 per person. I suggested ordering pizzas or sub sandwiches but he looked at me like I was crazy. I said okay well we can just offer less for the photographer and decorator and he said that isn’t how things are done. I said it is how things are done, and maybe if Peggy and him weren’t so spoiled and expecting the best of the best for everything then $10k would be plenty.After I said this he just closed his eyes and thanked me for the money and basically told me to get out.

I'm uncomfortable with her being around other people especially my fiance and his family looking like that. My parents see nothing wrong with her outfit. I told her if she doesn't find a different more decent dress, then she is no longer one of the brides maids and she's not invited to my wedding anymore. She feels that I'm being unfair since i have no right to control what people wear and i also let all bridesmaids choose whatever design they wanted as long as they stuck to the colors i gave. her chosen color sticks to the color scheme and that's okay but the design makes me feel it's not appropriate.

We wake up slightly later than usual, have a pancake breakfast, hang out at the rink for a couple hours, head to the arcade to try the claw machines, then eat dinner at this Indian restaurant before heading home and watching a movie with dessert.It’s important to us and we always do everything I mentioned. We’ve been doing it since he was 5. I always let him and my boyfriend know the date a week prior.On the morning of the day, my boyfriend decided to clean the kitchen and threw out the pancake mix. He then forgot to fill up the gas in my car so we had to go the gas station but it took forever because of traffic. Then when we finally got to the rink, he called me about 20 times to ask where something is or to discuss something about his daughter. We had to leave quickly so that the restaurant wouldn’t close so we skipped the arcade. When we were half way through eating my boyfriend called and said that he hurt himself. We packed up the food and rushed home only to find out that he hit his ankle against something but was ok otherwise. He then refused to let us watch the movie because he was watching something and he started eating the food we brought.My son called him a dick before stomping up to his room. I was just in shock. My boyfriend’s NEVER done this before and I really could not tell if he was being oblivious or if he was doing this on purpose.Boyfriend was all like “You just gonna let that slide?”I rolled my eyes at him before saying ”enjoy the food” I then went to our room. He followed after me asking me wtf my problem is. I told him that he knows how important this day is and he got pissed and was like “is that what this is about? I’m important too you know!“ I kind of snapped and told him that he isn’t as important as my son and that he ruined our day by acting like a little child. He went quiet, said that I’m being a bitch then left. He won’t answer any of my calls but texted my son saying that he expects an apology. It’s 5am and I haven’t been able to sleep. AITA here? Please be honest. I need to know if I was really being a bitch and if I overreacted or something.Edit:We’re in our 30s but he’s a couple years older, his daughter is 20 and has her own mom. We’ve been together for 4 years and we go on date nights every two or so weeks but I don’t have “boyfriend only” days like I do with my son.

	"body" : "I'm 37F and I come from a close-knit family. I have 2 younger siblings (28M and 27F) and my sister recently got engaged to FBIL (23M) after dating him for around a year. We all know him well and I have always got along with him. He comes from a rough background but he has always been very polite and charming. He doesn't talk about his own family or about his upbringing. My sister said it's a painful topic for him so no one ever pushed.There was recently a family event which FBIL attended. He was quiet during the day (he is normally high-energy and sociable) then disappeared for a while. When I went outside for some fresh air I bumped into him. He was emotional and said it was a hard day for him due to negative associations. He ended up offloading some quite shocking things from his past including that he has a history of very serious drug use (including needles) and that he has done sex work and p**n (men and women). I felt for him at the time because he was so upset (literally crying on my shoulder) but afterwards I felt more and more uncomfortable. I still feel bad for him since he clearly regrets it but it's very shocking to find out he has that kind of history and it does make me feel differently about him.Obviously I told my husband what FBIL told me because I didn't feel comfortable keeping it to myself. I also told my sister because I didn't know how honest he had been with her and it could impact on her decision to marry him. She was angry and said she was fully aware and it doesn't make her think less of him. I know others might disagree but I decided if my sister and FBIL weren't going to bring it up then it was my responsibility to make sure my family had the information they needed to make an informed choice about what kind of relationship they have with him. My parents agreed that it was the right thing to do and were grateful. My brother said he could see my point but didn't think it was my responsibility to share that information. My brother's wife thought I was out of line.When my sister found out I told our family about FBIL's sketchy past, she was very angry. She is now refusing to speak to me altogether because apparently this has affected FBIL quite badly. They are no longer engaged because \"he thinks he's not good enough for her\" and no one in my family has seen him since all of this happened. Obviously that wasn't my intention and no one said \"he isn't good enough\". I think it's naive to pretend that you see someone exactly the same way after finding out they're an addict, whether you like it or not there are risks that come with that lifestyle and relapses are common. I'm concerned that my sister will get hurt and I don't think it's unreasonable for my family to have access to the same information I do, especially when they're inviting him to their homes and there are children around etc.AITA for informing my family about FBIL's background?",

So my grocery bill would increase because I’d have to make it up in animal products. Who’s going to pay for that? I’m not vegetarian but I don’t really want to eat like that and I definitely don’t want to pay for it so would they make up that increase?- I honestly didn’t trust them to stop there. i already did what I felt was a reasonable accommodation and it wasn’t enough so how long til they take coconut, eggs and tomatoes from me too?- It was weird af to ask me in the first place and I felt really disrespected because this is my home and I don’t take second place to a guest. I can to her, personally, of course but that doesn’t extend to the apartment.I said I would agree to continue not using his serious allergens when he was present or soon to be and that was the line. It didn’t go over well at all and Layla told me I was overreacting and I could just do it and kept talking over me when I tried to say that I wouldn’t. Eventually she slipped up with the “well what if he moved in” and I said absolutely not and ended the conversation with her for the night.We argued in circles about it for nearly 2 weeks and once it was out, she didn’t drop it. I realized it wasn’t going to get better so I did what I didn’t want to do and told her that I was going to the landlord about breaking my part of the lease and she freaked out. Idk where Kyle’s money goes but apparently he doesn’t have any because she was yelling about not being able to afford it on her own and he couldn’t help even if he moved in. I told her that this had gone way too far and I didn’t think I could be happy living here with her anymore; if it were easier for her to leave instead, that would be fine too. She was really upset and I said I wouldn’t force her out or leave her suddenly on the lease alone but it was one or the other. Eventually she accepted it and decided she would move back in with her dad. That was the end of April and she’s fully moved out as of this week.My childhood best friend Allie has been flip flopping on moving to my city for forever now and me calling and saying I had an cheap open bedroom if she came right away got her to finally pull the trigger on it. And it helped Layla out because she didn’t have to pay to break the lease since I agreed to cover the full rent at my own risk. Allie has stuff to tie up in our home state still but she’s already sent me half of July’s rent. I just gotta squeeze for a lil while but I’ll make it.

Sadie is my close friend's cousin, and while I've seen her around and occasionally talk to her, we're not close friends or anything.

I didn't say anything but later messaged her (politely, I didn't go off) that I felt she was undermining my effort by having such showy centerpieces.Sadie said she wasn't trying to undermine anything and this is what they thought went with the decor.

I don't identify as a woman however, so I wasn't comfortable with this and asked for a potential compromise on my outfit. She insisted that I wore a dress.Cut to when my family were ordering their wedding clothes/figuring out their outfits. My parents asked if I had found anything suitable and I sent them a link to a romper that looks very much like a dress at first glance, it's genuinely not noticeable unless you look closely that the bottom part is not a skirt.We got the romper, it arrives and everything is fine. I wore it to the wedding and for the first part everything seems ok, until I am pulled along too hard by a kid and end up tripping and falling face first, sprawled out on the floor. As everyone nearby gathers around to see what happened, the bride notices that the bottom part of my outfit is shorts and not a skirt, and loses her shit and starts screaming at me that she made it clear I needed to wear a dress and that I was being selfish by going against her wishes on her special day. I'm pretty sensitive and also hate loud noise as I'm autistic, so I start crying because the mix of pain from scraping my leg and her loud voice yelling is enough to overstimulate me pretty badly. My cousin leads me away to treat my wound, the bride stalks off still fuming and won't speak to us for the rest of the night until we eventually leave at the end of the wedding.I was reassured by some members of my family that I didn't do anything wrong, but I'm still super hung up over it and wondering if it was bad of me to wear that.I'm happy to provide a link to my outfit if anyone wants to see it to gauge for themselves.edit: this was what I woreedit 2: not attending wasn't really an option, she was marrying a close family member and we were pretty much expected to be there. my parents said that i needed to come as welledit 3: this is the most feminine item I own by far, and the discomfort is mainly subconscious with dysphoria and all, and the being forced into a gender binary when that's not who I am. plus, i enjoy the security of not worrying if my skirt will fly up in the wind. i would've much preferred a pantsuit or something but knew that wouldn't go so this was the closest thing to fitting dress-code i could findedit 4: i am perfectly fine with providing photos of the professional photo prints they had done of the event when they are ready (as evidence), it just might take a whilemy reddit username is a fake name for safety",

	"body" : "My husband and I have family dinners at our house every month or so with our family. I have some sets of fine china that I like to switch out between the seasons that I've inherited from my grandmother. When we have our get togethers I serve dinner on these plates. My MIL compliments them everytime. My Sister-In-Law, however, has made comments to me that \"they're not her style.\" I honestly didn't think twice her comment about it until this past february when one of my plates was put in the sink, broken. Chalked it up to an accident.In April we had another dinner. This time SIL was carrying both her and her boyfriends plates to the sink, & accidentally dropped both. Again, no biggie at all. In May she broke two more plates & in June she broke a plate and a cup. At this point I was catching on.  I brought up these concerns to my husband and he brushed it off as accidents. I told my mom and she said she thought my SIL was doing it on purpose & got me a camera to put in my dining room.In July we had dinner, and I had an opportunity arise. My MIL, SIL and her bf joined us for dinner. While our plates were still ON THE TABLE my MIL asked how my plants were doing and I said I'd show her! I told my husband to follow us outside so he could show her the plant he's growing, leaving SIL alone with her bf. When we came back inside 5 mins later, her plate was broken.  When they left, I pulled up the camera footage. I saw her stand up when we walked out and peek around the corner, and then throw the plate on the ground. I kept this video to myself.That brings me to this past weekend, we had our family dinner and we were joined by My in-laws, SIL & her bf as well as my parents, siblings & niece. I served everyone, saving evil SIL for last. I brought her food out on a child's plate with a sippy cup and got those kid's silverware with the plastic handles. She looked at me confused and said \"I think you mixed my plate up with your niece's plate\" and I said \"No, niece's name is responsible enough to eat on a grown up's plate. If you're going to act like a child in my home, I'm going to treat you like a child in my home.\" She tried to play coy but I had my ipad ready and played the video to everyone at the table. She started sobbing, swiped the kids plate off the table and stormed out. My in-Laws both apologized and offered to pay for replacement plates but I told them not to worry about it. Despite this we still had a nice time.When everyone left my husband told me I was out of line and cruel, but I told him that this has been happening for months & I've told him it was bothering me multiple times. It's Wednesday, he's still being a little cold to me and I also got a text from my S-I-L's boyfriend asking me if I would apologize to her because \"I really embarrassed her.\" I sent him the video again and he left me on read. My husband just called me to ask if I was taunting her boyfriend because his sister called him crying that I was. So, AITA?",

	"body" : "I (30F) am friends with a couple, Mike and Sandra (35M and 38F) and invited them and their child Charlie (9F) over for dinner. Before they came over, I texted them to find out if any of them had any food sensitivities, allergies, needs, etc. The wife said there was nothing I needed to worry about.I decided on something a bit kid friendly while still feeling like I was cooking for adults so I settled on chicken parm with some chocolate cake for dessert. I figured it's like chicken nuggets mixed with pizza, which kids would like. It turned out really well for someone who's just started cooking like me. My friends were telling me that it was good, and maybe they were just being polite, but they ate everything. Charlie poked at her meal the entire time we were eating and I'm not sure she ate any of it. After we were done, I brought out the chocolate cake. Charlie ate a tiny bite and immediately started bawling. Sandra asked her what was wrong and she cried that she didn't like chocolate. Sandra continued to comfort her daughter while Mike and I awkwardly ate dessert.A couple of minutes pass and I notice Sandra is glaring at me. I hesitantly asked her if I could help her with Charlie. I'm not good with kids, which she knows, but I wasn't sure what else to do. She huffed and asked, \"Is there anything you'd like to say to Charlie?\" It took me a second to realize that she wanted an apology for her kid not eating my food. I thought it might help cheer Charlie up at least, so I said I was sorry that she didn't like my food. Charlie started crying harder and her mom asked me if I had anything she would like instead. I drew the line there. I told her that I wasn't going to cook anything else, and that if I didn't like what my mom made me as a kid, I went to bed hungry. Mike is just silently eating his cake while Sandra tried to convince me to make something else from for Charlie to eat.I stood up from the table and asked Mike if he would like me to wrap up his cake for him to take home because the rest of his family was apparently not having a good time. I suggested that Sandra could go home and make something for Charlie to eat. Sandra scoffed at me and said something about how I was cooking tonight and she thought she could have taken the night off. I knew I was about to say something I really regretted, so I slammed my plate on the table and told her to get out. Mike seemed genuinely embarrassed as they left. I haven't spoken to any of them since and now I'm thinking I overreacted by kicking them out of my house.EDIT: This happened about 3 days ago and I'm going to reach out to Mike today when it's not 4 AM. Thanks for the perspective, everyone!EDIT 2: Thank you to everyone for sharing all these new perspectives on this situation. I truly appreciate them all (except the guy who told me to just not act angry next time).I reached out to Mike today to apologize for kicking them out. Mike apologized for everything. He said that Sandra's mother had been admitted to the hospital that day so understandably nobody was really on their best behavior. He said they drove straight from the hospital to my house. He said he would have said something about it, but Sandra had asked him not to mention it then so she could focus on dinner, which is totally fair. Charlie isn't normally a picky eater or spoiled or autistic or anything, she was just upset about grandma. Why she latched onto saying she didn't like chocolate is really anyone's guess. Sandra's mom is doing better now and while the family didn't behave at their best, I've got no hard feelings about dinner any more. Maybe they're lying, maybe not, but I'm willing to give the friendship one more chance, though I probably won't cook for them again.",

	"body" : "I’m 16f. My parents split up before I was born, custody is I live with my dad most of the time and my mom every other weekend (plus random staying with her if I want) Recently, my dad got engaged to “Hanna”, and she and her kids are moving in. Hanna’s kids ages are: 9, 7, 2, 2, 2. She is widowed, so they live with her full time.This made room arrangements a bit awkward, since there’s only 3 kids bedrooms to go around. Dad and Hanna talked it over last night (without consulting anybody) and Hanna came over this morning to announce with my dad what they decided. Apparently, they want 9 and 7 to each have their own rooms, and me to share with the triplets because my room is significantly bigger than the others “and I don’t stay there full time”.I said their plan was stupid, they wanted me to share with 3 toddlers. They said they didn’t want me to move but it was the biggest room so other people should share. I said I didn’t care if I switched rooms, because the more logical move would have been the triplets in the big room, 7 and 9 share, and I get my own (I said I’d take the smallest one) until I move out. They said it would be more work to move my things to another room, and their idea was more “practical”. Then asked why I was so pressed since I don’t even live here full time.I said not staying in the room four days a month was a sorry excuse to land me with a bunch of toddlers, and if they seriously planned on doing it to me I’d make the custody arrangement change and I’d stay with mom for the most part (I know she doesn’t mind because both of them remind me I could stay with her whenever I wanted).This made Hanna cry because she just wants her family to blend together nicely and apparently I was ruining her plans. This made dad mad at me and Im not allowed to talk to Hanna until she forgives me. I didn’t know this meant so much to them but I’m still saying I’ll stay with mom longer if I have to share with toddlers,but my dad made me feel a bit guilty so AITA?UPDATE: I’m at my moms house at least for the weekend while the adults ‘try to work things out’ but my mom said I was welcome to live with her full time and if I really wanted we could change the custody agreement. :) Also thank you for all the replies I really wasn’t expecting this to blow up as much as it did lolUPDATE 2 (because somehow I’m still getting responses to this?): everyone talked, but dad and Hanna are staying with their decision and I’ve decided to move to my moms long term, and we’re gonna switch the custody around (so I’ll only see my dad every other weekend) and I’m just gonna sleep on the couch when I’m there. Obviously nothing is set yet but that’s what we’re gonna do, and thanks everyone for being so nice haha",

I bought her this wine glass that said “wedding planning wine glass” and every time she used it she would text me a photo of her with it.In 2022 I threw Bob a 30th birthday party - but then this was also the first year I wasn’t invited to her birthday.I had texted Bob asking what the plan was and he told me they were going out of the state for her birthday - however on instagram I seen them posting pictures of them renting a cabin with some friends…so I felt awkward.Then I wasn’t invited to the Bachlorette party - I didn’t find this too big of a deal because Jane has some really close childhood friends and sorority friends but then nothing about the wedding.The wedding happened this May and it was a big wedding - like 200 people probably and I wasn’t invited. I was really hurt to say the least but I didn’t say anything. I just tried to move on - I haven’t talked to them really since before the wedding - they didn’t wish me a happy birthday and they couldn’t attend my birthday shindig cause they were out of town.I’m noticing that if I don’t reach out to either of them, they don’t reach out to me at all.Now Bob has reached out and asked me to plan Jane’s birthday party cause he says “I’m the best at planning these things” and I told him I was hurt about not being invited and he said “well we had limit space don’t make it a big deal we want you to be at her birthday”I really don’t want to do it and I don’t really feel any desire to be friends with them - am I being a petty a*hole?EDIT: to clarify about the Bob’s birthday party - Jane asked me to help plan it - that was the last time I’ve seen them in person (march 2022).",

	"body" : "Edit: I am really sorry about my bad spelling. I am not a native speaker and actually struggle with grammar in every language. I tried to correct it.As to some questions:Does my husband have a dark secret?: No. Also, I am not harming him by being open with my family. It is an unspoken secret. His parents care more that he is married. They do not care if it is a \"real\" marriage.What qualifications do I have?: I share his religion and frequent the church, I work with an NGO, I have a very limited social media presence, I have a good education, I am not very loud, and I am a good host.Why was I encouraging my niece to be a beard?: I was not. She asked me what I thought, what I would do, etc. She wanted to help a friend out, and we talked about that. We talked about what could go wrong, about the drawbacks etc.Why do you blab so much about it?: I do not. At the very beginning, I sat my parents down and explained to them. They were okay with my decision. They only urged me to make sure I would be taken care of, even if my husband decided to divorce or if I wanted out. My sisters found out and \"confronted\" me. Since then, I only talk about it, when I am directly asked. I never offer information about it. But I am also not going to lie.I think that should be it.Ok, to make it short: I married for money. My husband is with me for appearances, and we are happy with our arrangement.My husband and I married because I have all the \"qualifications\" to please his family, and he takes financial care of me. We are very fond of each other and even love each other. But not in the classical marriage sense. We are like amazing roommates with some benefits. He and I are free to live our life's independently and without stresses. He is not worried about being cut off from his family, and I am finally financially stable and am free to work my job that simply is not as economically beneficial.The problem: My sisters have never approved of my decision. They say I sold myself. Which... fair. But still, we (used) to be civil with each other.Last week we had a family BBQ. I went without my husband. Everything was going great until my oldest niece (21) sat down next to me, and we started talking. And then she asked be me, straight up, if I was with my husband for money. I explained to her how we met, our agreement and so on. She then asked me if I think it would be okay for her to pretend to be her gay best friend's GF. I told her it was up to her to decide and if there were no negatives to it (like her having actual feelings for him, someone getting hurt like a romantic partner etc.). It was a lovely talk.Strike two was, apparently, when my other nieces asked me where my husband was, and I told them, that he was on vacation. They asked me why I didn't go with him, and I said that we only sometimes go together to vacations. We usually take little trips together but go on longer vacations with friends or family. My niece (16) asked me if it was true what her mom and aunt said about me being a gold digger and I just said\" I guess so\". Like, that doesn’t face me. I know my sisters constantly talk about me behind my back, and I am not ashamed about my marriage at all. So I see no need to lie.Later that night, my sisters cornered me, and we had a fight about my words with my nieces. They said it was completely inappropriate what I told them. That I am free to live my fucked up life but to not let my niece think, that it is okay what I do. I called them small-minded and that I was only answering my nieces questions, and I was even honest. They are free to do their own decisions. My sisters kept cornering me, calling me all sorts of names, and saying I was basically influencing their daughters negatively because I was miserable.I said some words back and left, not talking to them the whole week.Now there is a huge fallout because I pulled out of the family vacation because of this fight. But the vacation would be at my husband's summer House. And as I am not going, my husband doesn’t feel comfortable lending my family the house.My family has been calling me a huge AH, and my sisters said that I was blowing things out of proportion.AITA?

	"title" : "AITA for lashing out at my family for calling my fiance my \"second wife?\"",
	"body" : "Years ago, I was married to a close friend. We were roommates, adopted a dog together, and lived together since college until our mid/late twenties (married at 24 and 25). However, we were never actually romantically involved. She was not interested in marriage and also questioning her sexuality at the time, but her family was ultra-traditional (and messy for many other reasons) and kept pushing for her to \"settle down\". I had just gotten out of a rough long term relationship, and we kind of just both said fuck it, we basically were kind of living like a married couple, lets get married for convenience. So we did the paperwork for it, but we never had a wedding. We were also never romantically involved. She just was not my type and I was not hers. My family knew she wasn't my wife in the traditional sense (they did HEAVILY disapprove though).When I started getting back into the dating scene, we split up and legally divorced. She remains one of my close friends to this very day, and I care for her a lot. It's been a few years, and I am now 32 with a lovely fiance who I cannot wait to marry. However, ever since I announced the engagement my family has been making weird comments, like:\"Oh, so Roxie's (my dog) is getting a new step-mom!\"\"Wife #2 at 32 huh? That's a lot of wives for your age!\"\"Let's hope this 2nd one lasts!\"It makes both me and my fiance uncomfortable. I keep on saying that my close friend wasn't really my wife in the traditional sense, but my family brushes me off by saying that they're just joking, or she's technically my second wife anyway so it's not like they're wrong. Today at breakfast though, I blew up at them and called them disrespectful and rude for belittling my relationship. My mom and my sister both said that if I didn't want to hear these statements, I shouldn't have married my close friend. I threatened to not invite them to the wedding, and now things are super tense. AITA?Some edits from the comments I made to help answer some common questions:Why I married my close friend: Health insurance, mostly, but also because they kept holding her tuition over her head. We were both in grad school at the time (she was gunning for a PhD, I was going for a masters but I had a job in an energy commission with some benefits). They’d always tell her that they’d stop sending her money or (some months when the arguing was bad) not send her money at all. They used money to punish her, basically. She had a lot of health issues at the time that she couldn’t get help for, like chronic pain and wisdom teeth that really needed to be removed, alongside some other personal issues.So getting married got them off her back about her sexuality, got her on my health insurance plan, and got them to be more consistent on sending tuition money for her. There were a few other things too, like how they kept setting up potential arranged marriages for her or threatening to take her home to their country. There was also a time when they threatened to have her committed to a mental health facility.At the time, she was also really reluctant on letting me help her beyond minor things because she felt like it was something she had to repay. So between us, it also gave me an “excuse” to help her. I’d be like “hey, it’s what your spouse is supposed to do, right?” Even though we both agreed that our marriage was a farce, I think it did something for her psychologically to accept that we had a legally binding relationship where I could help her. I don’t know, it was complicated but it was something that worked for us. I was able to pay for her treatment and let her use my money for herself.She has now graduated and is financially stable. To my knowledge she no longer speaks with most of her family. She's doing amazing for herself and I am so damn proud of her.My fiance: My fiancé knows about my past marriage and has no issue with it. I met her through my close friend, actually, as a mutual of a mutual! At the time I was already split from my close friend, and while she was initially confused, me and my close friend both sat her down and explained things as clearly as possible. She understands why we did what we did.My family: I was always 100% transparent with my family on my marriage with my close friend. My family understood that I went through a rough relationship before my marriage. I think my mom’s exact words at the time were “I won’t force you to do anything, but I’m really disappointed that you take marriage so lightly.” They understood that I married my close friend to help her, but I also got the slight impression that they figured everything would sort itself out with our marriage (i.e. I would fall in love with her or something). My aunts and uncles didn’t say much else than that they were disappointed that they couldn’t attend a real wedding. When I met my fiancé, I told them how it was a big deal to me that it was my first, genuine, supportive romantic relationship in a long time. At the time, they all seemed happy for me and no comments like these came up. They told me they were glad I was able to find love again. It was only when we announced the engagement that these comments started.",

As long as we've known him, this friend has kept to a very strict diet, which has almost always led to us eating over at his place, but he is an excellent cook so I've never minded. We have not, however, seen him since both of our children were infants.For dinner, we were served salmon with quinoa and arugula. My son is very mild for a 5-year-old - he throws tantrums very rarely and is the opposite of a picky eater, but I could tell from how he was acting that he was not vibing with this meal. He was picking at his plate, shuffling food, and while he did try the salmon, he didn't seem to like it. I asked him if he was happy with his dinner and he said no, he wasn't.I basically said, \"Haha, kids, right?\" and asked if there was anything else for my son to eat. My wife's friend said that his daughter just eats whatever he makes, so he doesn't keep \"kid food\" around the house.My wife said it was fine, our son would be fine. While he is a mild kid, he definitely gets hangry and this was the beginning of our night, so we anticipated being there for an additional hour or two. I said that our son needed to eat so he'd have energy to play and apologized, saying I'd be gone for just a few minutes, picking something up for our kid. My wife's friend seemed irked, but said he'd try and keep my plate warm.I was gone for about 30 minutes, came back with a Happy Meal - ordered extra fries in case his daughter wanted any, which she was not allowed to have. By the time I was back, dinner was winding down. My son ate his meal, we had dessert, and he went off to play with his friend.It was definitely a hiccup in the night, but things went fine. We had a good time, but my wife was definitely cold with me. When we got home (3 hours after dinner), she told me that I was an ass at dinner for no reason. I pointed out that if I hadn't gotten our son dinner, he would've been a monster the entire way home, to which she replied that we would've left earlier. I said I was just looking to solve the problem as it happened and that if her friend had been more accomodating, we wouldn't have been in the situation in the first place.She got offended on his behalf and we decided to just go to bed because we clearly were not getting anywhere.

Malcolm has spent a lot of time helping care for Elena, driving her to school, making them meals, etc.Recently, Malcolm sat me down. He said that Sandra asked to speak to him. She said she understood if the answer was no but asked for him to take on custody of Elena, sooner rather than later that way she could adjust to him being her guardian before she passes. Malcolm would move in with them. Sandra had a sizable life insurance policy and an account to help him care for Elena.To my surprise, he agreed to all of this without consulting me. I pointed this out and he said we’ve only been together 6 months. I asked didn’t he feel too young for all this. He said sort of, but he’d do it for Elena. Without further discussion, he subleased his apartment and moved in with Sandra and Elena.Saturday, I stopped by to pick up Malcolm for lunch. He hadn’t returned from work yet so I was waiting with Sandra. We were making small talk. She mentioned how grateful she was for Malcolm and that he was a sweet boy. I asked if he was really her only option. I mentioned his mom. Sandra said Elena is losing enough, she doesn’t want to force her to move abroad on top of everything. She also doesn’t feel right asking Malcolm’s mom to move back.I said I found the whole thing a little selfish. Malcolm is only 22. He shouldn’t be tied down raising a child. Sandra got defensive and said she wished she didn’t have to ask him, plus he said yes. I asked what else was he supposed to say. Sandra told me I was upsetting her and asked me to leave.Malcolm called me later, screaming at me. He said that I upset Sandra. I said I was trying to defend him and point out options she may not have thought of. Malcolm told me to butt out and to get on board with this or walk away. He hasn’t spoken to me since. I saw Elena at the mall on Sunday and she ignored me.My mom told me I screwed up big time. AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for telling my wife we’re not going to pay our fair share for her parents assisted living?",
	"body" : "This whole situation has gotten way out of hand to the point everyone is yelling at everyone and I’m sleeping in the guest bedroom.My wife’s parents are at the point in their lives where they can no longer live by themselves. Their children decided the best place for them is an assisted living facility. They started to look into different facilities and admittedly, I didn’t help because I figured the 5 adult siblings could handle it and I was never close to my in-laws. They found one that was perfect and my wife was very excited when she told me about it. I was less than thrilled when I found out our contribution will be roughly $3,000 upfront then $5,000 a month.I immediately question why it cost roughly $15,000 upfront fee and $25,000 a month for 2 people in an assisted living apartment. I admit I sarcastically asked if their apartment is next door to Elon Musk’s parents. She then told me that we’re going to cover the lion’s share of the costs because we make more than her siblings. That was the beginning of a week of texts, phone, and in-person arguments. She argues that her siblings make less money combined than we do and some are single so it would impact them more thus so it’s only fair we pay more. She also argues that this facility is not the best or most expensive, it’s a mid tier one with the best ratings. According to her, anything lower have bad ratings and could put her parents’ safety in jeopardy. My argument is that there are 5 siblings so the costs should be divided equally between the 5 of them. I also argued that if 5 people can’t afford that place, they need to lower their standards. That started a circular argument for hours between cost and safety. I couldn’t take it anymore and in the heat of the moment, I yelled,“we don’t make more that your brothers and sisters, I make more than all of you which is why you all want me to cover the cost for YOUR parents!”That was the beginning of my nights sleeping in the guest bedroom. I know as a married couple I shouldn’t consider “mine” and “yours” income but realistically I do make more than all of them and I think it’s unfair to make me pay the largest portion.What do you all think?UpdateI’m going to answer some questions.I assumed it was $25,000 a month because I assumed it was split 5 ways between the siblings and our share was $5,000 a month. It’ll be closer to $10,000 a month and our share is $5,000.Her parents have assets including a house so I was told they don’t qualify for government assistance. I brought up the idea of selling their house but was shot down immediately. The siblings want to keep the house in the family because their great grandfather built it or something.I can afford to pay it but I don’t want to based on principle. Their division means I’ll be paying $5,000 a month while the youngest brother will be paying only $300 a month and will be living in the house. Their thinking is that he’ll be paying the insurance and taxes on the house so he can’t afford more than $300.Another update4. I’m the only child to my parents. While they planned out their retirement, they worked their entire lives to put me through school and supported me through several degrees. I will be solely responsible for and will make sure their remaining days will be comfortable.5. Per your suggestion, I asked my wife if we’re going contribute this much money to her parents, how they’re going to contribute to my parents when their time comes. She answered, “don’t be an idiot, that’s an entirely different situation.”6. I don’t want ownership of their house because it’s very old and needs major work. I brought up the idea of selling the house again and it was shot down again. They’re not budging on it.7. None of us know the laws and regulations when it comes to this so I finally got her to agree for us to sit down with an estate attorney.8. Unless I feel up to it, this is probably the last update. I feel completely emotionally drained. I always knew my parents would get old but I never thought about it.",

	"title" : "AITA for kicking only my SIL out which meant she had to fly home early from vacation?",
	"body" : "I (29F) have a half brother, James (37). James is married to Lindsay (35) and they have two kids, 4f and 2m. I invited James, Lindsay and the kids to visit me this past week, and they were meant to stay until next friday.Lindsay and I have always got on fine, except for the fact that she’s always had a weird attitude to me being a SAHW/M. She always asks me if I’m going to ask my husband before making non-essential purchases, or asks me if I feel bad relaxing while he’s working, or suggests I do things for him as a ‘thank you’ to him since I’m apparently not doing anything else. I know that James and Lindsay are big on splitting costs and while he pays for everything for both kids he won’t pay for Lindsay, despite making about 25x her salary. Being that that’s the relationship they’re happy with, I just roll with the comments because my marriage must look weird to Lindsay.However, there is a line. A few days ago we were sitting on our rootftop drinking wine after the kids went to bed. Lindsay was admiring the view and made a comment about how much our apartment cost (James must have told her), and asked if my name was on the deed. She then said ‘half of (X amount) penthouse just for lying on your back? S*x work is way more lucrative than I thought’. Both my husband and James laid into her for the comment, I was obviously furious and told Lindsay first thing in the morning she had to get out, she wasn’t staying here after speaking to me like that, especially when she wasn’t even apologetic. I felt bad for ruining James and the kids’ trip but both my husband and I were too angry to have Lindsay there.The next morning, Lindsay asked if she could stay. She said James wasn’t willing to end the trip early and wanted to stay but she couldn’t afford to stay in a local hotel. She blamed her comment on the wine but her apology/explanation seemed so insincere and was clearly based on having no choice. I told her this and said even if she did mean it, I just needed some space from her and didn’t want her around after what she said because when put on top of what she’s been saying for years, it’s obvious that’s what she thinks. James then said he wasn’t paying for her hotel because it was her own actions that got her kicked out, and she would have to fly home early and he’d fly back with the kids as planned, which is what happened.Lindsay has since laid into me over text and social media for forcing her to go home early without her kids. Both my mother and James’s have said I was wrong for kicking Lindsay out. James’s mother said I should have just let her stay for James’s sake and not invited them back. My mother says I should have kicked all of them out because now Lindsay has to be away from her kids. I don’t think I’m the AH for kicking out the person who made the comment but not the person who defended me and innocent kids.Did i handle it like an AH?",

	"title" : "AITAH for making my daughter cry at a restaurant?",
	"body" : "My(F45) daughter (12) decided 2 weeks ago she wants to be a vegetarian. I was fine with that. I would support and encourage her if that's what she wanted. The past 2 weeks she has been looking down on the rest of the family with snooty comments like \"you know that will just sit in your colon right?\" And \"It doesn't make you THE murderer, but it def makes you the accomplice.\" Her brother(7) is getting sick of it and so am I. Especially when I just get home from work and I just want to relax and enjoy my meal.3 days ago was my sons birthday and we decided to take him out to his favorite restaurant. This place had vegetarian options so I was not worried about my daughter being upset about that. I asked her if she wanted to go and she excitedly said yes. We get there and when the waiter takes out order, my daughter decided she wanted a mushroom burger. I said \"Woah, I thought you wanted to go vegetarian?\" She says \"I'm taking a break since its a special occasion.\" I told the waiter to cancel that order and give us a few minutes.I looked at her and said \"Look here missy, you have been nothing but a jerk these last few days with your passive-aggressive commments since going vegan,  vegetarian, whatever! You either commit to it now or you get nothing at all.\" She doesn't even look at me, she just flops her head on the table and starts crying the moment I start talking. My husband does nothing but says \"way to go\". She doesn't move her head the entire dinner even when I ask if we need to talk outside? Go the the bathroom to collect herself? Nothing. We get home and she just goes to her room. My husband thinks im the AH because I had to ruin a night out.AITAH?2nd Edit: When I said Mushroom Burger, I mean a hamburger with sauteed mushrooms on top with melted cheese. It's definitely not a portobello patty.Edit for clarification: So my husband and I told her to knock it off with the comments before this happened. At first, it was random cons about eating meat. I told her I'm aware but this is my choice.Then came the rude remarks like \"So you're just gonna take 2 years off your lifespan like that?\" When I chose to reheat meatloaf for dinner instead of a pizza. At that point, I told her that she does not get make rude remarks about people's lifestyle choices like that and if she says something rude like that again, im taking away her phone. Of course she cried and ran to her room.She stopped saying things to me and her dad, but then she would start picking on her brother when we were out of ear-shot and would deny it when he would tell us. Apparently she has being telling her brother that he's a loser for eating meat (hotdogs) and so are his friends. After doing this twice I took her phone away and told her to apologize to her brother and if she wants to educate people on vegetarianism, thats fine, but she needs to stop being a bully about it. Again, she breaks down and just runs to her room. I'm not even yelling at her, this is how she tries to deflect accountability.I tried to talk to her an hour later about it, but she flailed onto her bed and started bawling. I told her she needed to calm down and have a conversation with me about what's going on. She just screamed \"NOOOO\" so I left before I lost my cool. At this point, I am really considering therapy for us.Update: I'm taking the verdict that I was the AH. I should have just not said anything during the dinner. I'm just so tired of her behavior this past year. She realized at some point she can just flail and cry to avoid having to talk about her actions until someone (usually her dad) tells everyone to leave her alone because \"she cant handle the situation right now\". I dont know if it's her friends, tik tok, or both.I am trying to support her vegetarian diet by encouraging her to eat salads, meat substitutes, etc. But we had another argument last night. As most of you pointed out, yes, she was eating mostly junk food to avoid meat. I wanted to take her shopping for better options, but I also wanted to address what was going on. I told her \"I support you going vegan and I'm sorry for what happened at your brother's Birthday. But you saying mean things to us for eating meat, calling your brother a loser for eating a hot dog, and then turning around and ordering a burger in front of him is very hypocritical of you. I need you to understand that we have been very supportive these past few weeks and we dont deserve that treatment. Ok?\" She just stares at the tv and doesn't say anything. \"Baby, I need to know if youre understanding. I'm willing to help you out with this change, we can go shopping tomorrow morning for better options like salads and meat substitutes, but we are not going to put up with these comments anymore okay?\"O MY GAWD IM TRYING TO WATCH MY SHOW! CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT!?\" She screamed at me! I'm sorry y'all but I was done with gentle parenting at this point. I don't want to go into detail with everything that happened that night but im making an appointment with a therapist this week. Wifi password is changed. And she is grounded from certain things this summer. She flailed, she cried, i didnt walk away this time. I stood firm, pulled out my phone and said, \"How would you feel if your friends saw you acting like this?\" And that was that. I tried being the supportive parent but she is being a not nice girl and I refuse to have that behavior in my house. For those who are going through the same thing, thank you for understanding.",

	"body" : "I (21f) usually always sit with the same group of people in my university’s dining area. There’s this girl who i’ve talked to a few times, but i’m not really friends with. She’s kind of quiet, but when she finally talks she seems normal. I’ve sat across from her a few times and noticed how she was eating because it was weird to me. She eats maybe half of her food (keep in mind you control the amount of food. it’s cooked by the cafeteria staff buffet-style. she could easily take less) and kind of plays with it with her fork when she’s “done” (aka eating half of it, sometimes even less).I didn’t say anything for a while, but a few weeks ago I had to ask her why she always only ate half her food. She seemed a  embarrassed, but answered she thought she was more hungry and laughed it off. I then asked her why she made this mistake every time we ate, and that she must have learned by now. She didn’t really answer (I don’t actually remember, but it wasn’t actually an explanation) and left pretty quickly. She doesn’t really show up that much anymore, but when she does she still eats like this, and I couldn’t hold it in anymore. I asked her once again, and also asked her if her parents never told her not to play with her food.It was a genuine question, some people are raised in households where manners aren’t important, but obviously they are for most people. She got really mad at me and told me to stop commenting on her eating habits and that it was none of my business. I told her that it absolutely was since she was sitting at our table and obviously wasting food. She told me to go fuck myself and left and threw out the rest of her food (AGAIN!) After she left, one of my friends told me to leave her alone as she seemed like she was having a hard time and maybe had some sort of issue with food. Yeah, obviously she has an issue with food?? She keeps wasting it! She hasn’t shown up again, i’m assuming she buys her own food now, which might teach her not to waste it so that’s good. The same friend who told me to leave her alone keeps pestering me to apologise to her, but I think she should apologise to me. She’s unnecessarily rude when being asked the most basic and obvious questions and also told me to go fuck myself? That’s way more harsh than anything i’ve ever told her. Keep in mind that I care a lot about food waste and the environment. AITA for telling a girl to stop wasting food?EDIT: OK! I’m the asshole! Sorry i’m not studying to be an eating disorder specialist. I looked up stuff about it and i’m realising I was too harsh. I’ll apologise the next time I see her and try not to be so condescending. But you should all follow your own advice. If people genuinely don’t know something you should tell them nicely instead, and i realise i should’ve tried to educate her NICELY about food waste and not have commented at all on how she was eating",

They were together 4 years before that, so it wasn't like she ran off with some guy she just met. We supported her decision, she was old enough and working full time.The issue is rent in our area has more than doubled on average since. Their landlord raised the rent 40% in the span of 3 months, and they couldn't afford to stay there anymore. The issue is they weren't exactly swimming in cash before that, they don't really have enough for first last and security with the market, not that there's much to but anyway in their price range.Their plan was to move in with her boyfriends parents for a few months while they figured stuff out and saved up, but they won't let her come with. So they proposed an idea, she'd move back in with us, him with his parents, and they'd save up and be gone in 6 months tops. The issue is me and my husband don't feel that's appropriate. She's an adult now, and she needs to learn to take care of herself, not relying on handouts from her parents. She offered to pay rent, but we would only do that if she agreed to pay the market average plus her share of utilities, which would mean she couldn't save up like she wants to.Because we aren't doing that, she's been force to share a 2 bed appartment with 6 other people, some of whom she finds \"sketchy\".

Since the house was just going to stay empty until I was done with college my aunt (on my moms side) and I talked about it and we agreed she would stay there since she's taking care of my grandma and her place was small. I will move back in once I've finished my schooling.My dad assumed my mom left me her money and left the house to my aunt. I didn't correct him because I don't trust my dad or have a great relationship with him. I am currently living with him, his wife Jan, and her twin daughters(17, both lovely people) in a 3 bedroom flat. 2 months ago he found out that my mom left me the house. I'm not sure how he found out but he did. Since then I haven't heard the end of it, I'm selfish for making us all stay in a tiny flat, I'm spoiled because I won't share my inheritance, I'm a terrible person for making the twins take out loans. You get the gist.This weekend was the twins birthday at my grandma's house. Most of my dad's family was there (we get along great usually), his wife's family, and some of both of their friends there along with the twins friends. After they were done opening my present to them they asked me if that was really it. (I got the matching bracelets with their birthstones, which they both loved btw) It got quiet and I asked them what else they were expecting. They said Jan said that I was planning on surprising them on their birthday by telling them we were moving into my moms house and helping them with college. My grandma asked Jan if this was true and Jan started in on me again. She asked what she could do to make me stop being a bitch, pull my weight, help out, and be fair.I told her she could drop dead. That my mom died for me to get all these things she wanted me to give her daughters. I said if she wanted everything to be fair then she should drop dead and I would share everything I had with her daughters since we would have all lost a mother then. That it would be fair only after that happened. She and my dad started yelling at me and my grandma and uncles started yelling at my dad and  Jan and everything was pretty much over after that.The whole ride home my dad and Jan were getting calls and texts from family and friends telling then they were disappointed in them and I was getting texts from Jan's family, the twins friends, and a few of my own cousins saying I was selfish. I don't usually fight with my cousins so I'm really starting to think maybe I am being selfish and that I went to far at the twins party.AITA?Edit:Thank you guys so much for the support. When everyone who usually backs you up says you're an AH it's hard to believe your not. But as some of you guessed my cousins heard the word inheritance and got greedy and that's why they sided with them. I was getting texts asking for money from them these past few days.I am moving in with my grandma on my dad's side. She picked me up this morning and we've been moving my stuff instead of going to school today.The twins talked to their friends and they have texted their apologies. Although I'm not going to pay for their whole college experience I think I'm going to help them buy books and with on campus living.

Since we are both married and both plan on having kids, the topic of names came up and we both said we wanted to name a child after our grandma, lets say her name was Victoria. We didn't really fight about this per se and just agreed whoever had a daughter first could use the name. About a year ago Pam got pregnant which was very exciting. We found out it was a girl and did a gender reveal where we announced we were going to use the name Victoria. My sister was not upset about this and jokingly said something along the lines of you beat me to the punch. A few weeks after this my sister announced that she was pregnant.Sadly, late into the pregnancy Pam miscarried and lost the baby. This was incredibly difficult on us and Pam suffered especially bad, both physically and mentally. My family has been there to support us but we have asked Layla to give us some space as seeing her pregnant is a lot for us at this time. While she was upset about this, she understood. Recently, my parents threw my sister a gender reveal party similar to the one we had for Pam. My Mom convinced me and Pam to go and we felt we were in a good spot to go. We get to the party and all is great until we get to the gender/name reveal. The way it was going to work was Greg's family was inside the garage holding a banner that would be pink or blue and say the babys name. When the garage opened me and my wife were shocked to see a banner that said \"Welcome baby Victoria Greg's last name\". I asked my sister WTF and she said since we weren't using the name its only fair she should get to. My wife started sobbing and I took her to my car but not before telling my sister she is an evil human being who doesn't deserve to be a mother. Now my Mom is mad at me because Layla also has a high-risk pregnancy and this was very stressful for her. Most of my family is saying I should apologize for what I said. AITA?ETA: I think people may be confused about this and this is my fault for using the wrong words. When i say miscarried, my wife gave birth to a stillborn. while our daughter was never alive, my wife gave birth to her, it was just too early for the baby to live sadly. Our daughter is buried in a grave that says Victoria, which I think is part of the reason I was so upset",

I told her she either needs to change her lifestyle, somehow make sure whoever she sleeps with won't bother me and make it clear to everyone that we're not the same.In response, she told me I need to mind my own business, that I shouldn't be such a prude and that I could probably use, in her words, \"some dicking\" myself. It kind of escalated from there resulting me in calling her a sl*t (which is definitely an AH thing to say, but I lost my cool).Anyway, AITA for demanding my sister to change her way of living, or otherwise make sure her interaction with people doesn't affect me?",

I came out my family as bi when I was 16 and from the very beginning, they were nothing but supportive and to this day, almost my entire family accepts me as who I am.My niece (20F) is the only exception. She is my brother‘s (43M) daughter and despite her parents showing no prejudices against the LGBTQ+ community, she doesn’t make a secret of her homophobia.I don‘t know where her believes stem from but the day I first introduced my husband/ then boyfriend to her family, she has been very hostile towards us (she was 14 at the time). She refuses to speak to my husband, barely acknowledges us at family gatherings and despite her father constantly chastising her, frequently uses the f-slur to refer to members of the LGBTQ+ community and calls same-sex relationships disgusting.Due to a severe flooding, my brother and his family have been forced to evacuate their house. My husband and I have a guest room and a sofa bed in our living room so when my brother asked we whether his family could stay at our place for a while, I told him that him, his wife and their younger children (15F, 12M) were very welcome to stay as long as they needed to, but that we weren’t comfortable letting his oldest daughter stay with us.He seemed to have been expecting that answer and told me that he understood my reasons. When he broke the news to his daughter, she was furious, asking where else she was going to stay and that she had nowhere else to go. From what I know, my brother offered to help her pay for a cheap hotel, but see doesn’t want to dip into her savings because she doesn’t work and she‘s been living with my brother rent free.Apparently, she‘s been staying with a friend for a few days now and she‘s been telling her mother how awful it is there. My brother is still supporting my decision, but his wife has started trying to convince me to let her eldest daughter move in.She‘s been pushing me to get over her comments because my niece is still \"young and naïve\" and that she couldn’t have known her actions would have major consequences. She‘s advising me to be the bigger person and not let my \"hard feelings\" for her daughter stop my from helping a family member, because that would be an \"AH thing to do\".",

Growing up, mom would spend hours on my sister's hair, and each morning was dedicated to the two of them in bathroom, with my sister screaming and crying because brushing through it was long and unpleasant. Up until she was 13, mom insisted on washing and styling my sister's hair. She never let her cut it or dye it. When someone suggested getting it trimmed they were kicked out of the house. I won't lie, mom was controlling at times but I thought we all knew it was because of grief and memory of our dad.Well mom died and the first thing my sister did was get her hair chopped incredibly short and dyed. She sent myself and my siblings a picture of her new haircut, with the caption 'Sharon (our mom) always said I was going to grow my hair down to my butt...Not anymore'.  I thought it was my sister's way of grieving but now she mentions it a lot, like asking how pissed do I think mom would be if she saw my hair this short.I told her after the 5th comment to stop acting like her haircut was a big achievement, it's not, millions of people get haircuts and she should know her hair was important to mom because it reminded her of dad. She said she's wasn't suppose to be Sharon's doll or a replacement of their dad, she should have been her own person and if I can't respect that she doesn't need me in her life.AITA?",

	"body" : "Obligatory Throwaway. All names changed for anonymity.I (44F) am married to my hubby, Jimmy (48M) for over two decades. My parents died suddenly in a car accident 10 years ago. I have a younger sister, Abigail (39F) with Downs Syndrome, and Jimmy and I are guardians.  Abigail is my sweet angel on Earth. When my parents passed, I was a working mother of three young kids, helping to build our family business with my husband. At first, Abigail lived with us full time. Jimmy has always been at my side with her care and loves her to bits. After a few months we realized that my sister needed more attention than we could give her. There was just not enough time in the day. We discussed what would be best for her and decided to put her into a private adult home for special needs people. It's very costly (over 10k a month) and comes from our own finances. The facility does all sorts of activities and field trips. She loves her home, her friends and the \"special\" days the facility hosts. We are always stopping by to either visit, sign her out on holidays to spend with family, keep her overnight for special sleep overs with my kids and take her on every vacation with us. We never go more than 24 hours without one of us making sure she's ok.Now onto the issue. I have a SIL, Jenny (42F) who had her first child after years of trying. She's become the typical first-time mom who believes she invented motherhood and is openly opinionated about things she believes other parents fall short on. I mostly ignore her and so does Jimmy. We hosted a BBQ at my house for Labor Day with my FIL, MIL, Jenny, her husband, baby and my kids. Abigail had a planned trip to the zoo and asked if she could go. Of course, we said OK. While I we were eating, Jenny turned to me and asked me where Abigail was. Her tone was more accusatory than questioning. I simply didn't want to get into it with Jenny, so I said Abigail wanted to stay at the home. Jenny then turned to her hubby and said, \"See this is why it won't ever happen.\" My MIL asked Jenny what she was talking about. Jenny, all snarky, said to the whole table, \"We did our wills last week and knew these two wouldn't be suitable as guardians of our baby if something happened to us. They tossed her sister into a home rather than be real family to her! I won't let that happen to my child.\" I didn't let it show, but I was extremely hurt she could say this. Instead of yelling, I laughed at her and said, \"Well that's great news since I have ZERO desire to raise your kid.\" More was said but that's the gist of it. Jenny left with her family calling me nasty swear words as she walked out. (I might of said a few swear words myself right back at her!)It's been over a month now and Jimmy is still getting nasty texts from Jenny demanding I apologize. My MIL knows she overstepped with her comment but is asking me to be the bigger person and say sorry to keep the peace. I refuse. AITA?",

There, Jack told everyone about an achievement that he obtained over spring break: he visited his 150th country (Cambodia).

I said “Don’t worry about me” but Jack kept pressing the issue.I finally said “Jack, visiting 150 countries is cool and all but it doesn’t say anything about you as a person. It just means you had rich parents who could afford to travel internationally several times a year.” (I grew up poor, (literally) worked my ass off in high school, got a full ride merit scholarship, and did everything humanly possible to land my current 6-figure job. Rich people who think they’re better than everyone else just because they had rich parents is a HUGE pet peeve of mine.

We also have one biological child together, Harry (16M).Jim's and Paige's mom passed away they were 9 and 5. I met Bill around 2 years after his former wife had died. When I started building a relationship with the kids, I made it clear that I was not going to replace their mom and would be a trusted figure whom they could approach if they ever needed me. That being said, I still made an effort to treat them like I would my own child. I would take them to school, pick them up, take them to doctor's appointments, make their lunches, ask my parents to get them presents for Christmas and birthdays etc.Both kids were somewhat hostile towards me at first, which I understand because they lost their mom. However, Paige eventually warmed up to me and saw me as a trusted confidant and maternal figure. She didn't ask me nor did I expect her to want me to adopt her, but she still calls me mom which I appreciateJim on the other hand continued to be mean and hostile. I have never treated him poorly or antagonized him. Nevertheless, he would make misogynistic statements like \"it's your job as the woman to clean the dishes\" when I would ask him to clean his plate or call me a bitch when my back was turned. My husband told him many times that the way he was treating me was uncalled for and for us to go to family therapy but he always refused.He eventually moved out after reaching adulthood. He continues to maintain contact with his father and siblings but its minimal between him and me and even then he doesn't treat me well. Now I have an engagement ring that is a family heirloom for several generations. It is passed down from the mother to the oldest child. My husband got the ring from my mom to propose to me. I told all 3 children about this heirloom a few years ago.Anyway, Jim currently has a girlfriend whom he intends to propose to. He called me out of the blue one day and asked if he could have the ring. I told him no. When he asked why, I told him it was because of how he has treated me all these years and how he continues to treat me and I don't want my family heirloom going to someone who sees me as vermin. When he asked whom it would go to, I told him it would go to Paige when she gets engaged. When he heard this he lost his shit and accused me of playing favorites.

For now, my MIL and FIL (60s-Debra and Bob) are helping me with household stuff and the baby. So far, we haven’t had any real issues and they’ve been a massive help.About 3 weeks ago, I fell down the stairs. I wasn’t holding the baby and the baby was safe. However, instead of helping me, Debra and Bob both jumped to comfort the baby who was crying… and left me at the bottom of the stairs. My legs were fine, but I was wobbly because of shock and asked one of them to help me up. After nearly 10 whole minutes of being ignored, I managed to stand up on my own and hobble through to the living room. I sit down and Debra says ‘what’s happened to you? Are you ok?’.I’ll admit, I saw red. I just said 'I fell down the stairs, didn't you hear me calling you for help?' Debra's eyes widened and she said she was too busy fussing over the baby.After an hour, my arm was swelling up and I was taken to hospital. Luckily, it was nothing serious and recovery time would be quick. After my boyfriend got home and his parents left, I told him I no longer want their help after today's events. I can manage on my own, even though it'll be hard. He was taken aback and said they've done a lot for us. I said I appreciated it all but they ignored me crying and calling them for 10 minutes after I fell down the stairs. They don't care about me, only the baby and I was embarassed I didn't see it sooner.He called his parents to let them know we won't need their help anymore and his dad said 'is it about today? we really didn't hear her.' My boyfriend just told them they're invited to sunday roast this week and that's all. I could tell he was not happy about my decision but he said he went along with it because I'm the mother.Fast forward to Sunday and my BIL and SIL are guests as well. SIL has a 3 year old and is totally on my side but BIL is not. He told me to 'be grateful' for his parent's support as they're significantly more well-off than my parents are and paid for many newborn/infant expenses and plan to pay for many more as the baby grows.Since then, Debra keeps calling asking if we need any help and says she feels awful not seeing 'the both of you' and that she misses the baby.AITA for not wanting them helping me in my day to day life?EDIT: Was the baby crying loudly enough that there is a possibility they didn’t hear you?No way. The baby stopped crying after 10 seconds and the stairs are like 2 meters from the living room. There is absolutely zero way they couldn't have heard me1- scream as I fell2- the general noise of someone falling, including books falling and wall plates breaking3- me crying and shouting for helpI fell at the top of the stairs and fell all the way down. This wasn't a missed step and a bum shuffle down that hurt my pelvic bone. I fully fell down the stairs and cracked the banister. No way they didn't' hear. The baby also started crying AFTER the initial smack after I hit the ground.",

(Not real names for privacy.)My kids don't get along super well, Dax thinks \"pranks\"are really funny, I guess like every 12 year old boy, and he annoys Mia with them a lot. It's something my husband and I have been working on as it's the source of many fights between them.Dax gets a lot of prank ideas from YouTube and TikTok and will often recreate what he sees. Most of them are harmless (something like a fake spider in her food etc.), but this time I think he went too far.Dax thought it would be funny to put Saran Wrap over the toilet before my daughter went to the bathroom. He says he got the idea from online? Idk if this is a thing but it's a terrible prank. Basically he put plastic wrap under the toilet seat so if someone sits on it, well pretty much it makes a mess instead of going in the bowl. Yeah I know, ew.So he does this right before Mia goes in the bathroom to pee. When she gets in there she sits on the seat like normal, pees, and since there's plastic wrap over the hole, her pee collects on it and gets everywhere, all around the ground on the toilet and on her.She comes to me crying. She's embarrassed because she's a teenage girl and this is... disgusting. I told Mia to shower and not worry about the mess.Here's where I might be TA... I go to my Son and yell at him for what he did. I tell him that's not an appropriate prank and he's old enough to know that's not okay. And then I made him clean in up.He started crying saying it's unfair I make him clean his sisters pee. \"It's gross and he's going to be sick.\" He says \"it's from her body so she should clean it.\" But it was all his fault and literally his mess to deal with, I don't know why I should humiliate my daughter further or why I should have to clean it. And biggest thing, he needs to learn.I told him the mess was his fault and he should think about the repercussions of his actions next time, because this is what his prank caused. And then I stood in the doorway and watched as I made him clean all of the urine off the floor and toilet.I think it was an appropriate punishment considering it's really just the natural consequence of what he did, and it doubles as a general lesson in how to clean a toilet which he has to learn at some point anyway.Well my husband disagrees. This all happened while he was at work, and after he got home Dax complained to him.He told me I was overly harsh on our son and \"put him in danger\" by exposing him to germs. But I gave him the same gloves I use when I have to wash the toilet and it's not like he was unsupervised.But my husband is mad at me and told me I want \"too far\" and that's \"bad parenting.\" Of course my son is mad at me too.

Linda was beautiful, smart and had an amazing sense of humor.She’s been part of the family for so long that most of us don’t remember a time without her. Most of our best memories have her in them.Linda was very close to my nephew Drew (6M). Drew is disabled and autistic, so he has a hard time connecting to other people. I don’t know how to describe the relationship between Drew and Linda, they just sort of clicked, from the moment he was born she was his best friend and would often watch over him.Sadly Linda passed away at the end of January after she was hit by a drunk driver. The entire family was devastated and we are still mourning her.Drew took it especially hard since he doesn’t really grasp what death means yet. He constantly asks where Linda is and when she’ll be coming back, sometimes going as far as having full blown meltdowns because he misses her so much. He is currently attending therapy to learn how to process his grief but it’s a slow progress.Drew’s birthday is in 2 weeks, and my sister and BIL sent out invitations to everyone in the family asking who can come. Birthdays are a big deal in our family and are usually an over the top event with catering so it’s necessary to confirm the number of guests.Apparently Ron wrote that he’ll come with Gia, a new girlfriend he is hoping to introduce to the family.Most of the family is pissed at him for moving on so quickly. I personally think it’s none of my business and I’m not going to tell him what to do or how to live his life, however bringing a new partner over to his nephews birthday when he knows how said nephew was so attached to his former gf and is still mourning her, is idiotic at best and cruel at worst.BIL told Ron that if he’s planning on bringing that girl over for Drew’s birthday he shouldn’t bother coming at all. Ron called me to complain and I told him the same thing, he shouldn’t bring her over.Ron called me an asshole and a bad brother, he said that he’s finally happy again after Linda’s death and why is it so hard for us to accept that he moved on and support his relationship. I told him I’m happy to hear he’s doing well and I’m sure the family would someday love to meet the girl that makes him so happy, but I’m standing by my opinion that inviting her now was a dumb decision on his part and he chose the worst possible time and place to introduce someone new to the family.Edit: Ron and Linda were still together when she passed away.",

	"body" : "My (36f) child (7f) asked if she could ride her pony to school last week. For context, we have a small paddock attached to our home where we keep 2 horses, one for me and one for my child. Every morning before school my child gets all of her pony chores done before we leave and we normally walk to school which takes around 20 minutes. We live on the outskirts of a fairly populated city where it’s not uncommon to see horses occasionally, but we are by no means in a rural village.I agreed to let my daughter ride her pony to school because I thought it was a harmless fun thing to do, and also it gives the pony some exercise as we had evening plans and wouldn’t be riding that evening. We arrived at the school gates and of course gathered a little bit of a crowd which wasn’t a problem. The pony is very good and lapped up all the pats and strokes from kids.One girl came bounding over from the year above my daughter and started shouting at me saying she wanted to ride. I politely told her that she couldn’t because she doesn’t have a riding hat and she would have to learn on a safer horse. She immediately started hysterically crying and pleading with her mum saying he wanted to ride. Her mum looked at me with disgust and said “see this is what happens when you have no self awareness and bring a f-ing horse to a school” and stormed off dragging her kid with her. I was a bit taken aback but ignored her, sent my child into school and walked the pony home.I was talking to my friend this weekend and she said I was in fact the problem and I was blatantly showing off and should have known that this would cause upset and problems. My response is I turn up to the school gates in jodhpurs and boots regularly so everyone probably knows I have horses, is that showing off too? All I wanted to do is let my daughter do something a bit silly and fun. Now I am really overthinking it though and almost feel nervous to do school drop off tomorrow…. So am I the asshole for letting my daughter ride her horse to school?EDIT: I want to clear some things up. Firstly, I’m based in England. Secondly, the pony never went into school grounds. There is a small patch of grass about 30 metres from the main school gate and we stood there so no child with allergies would have been subject to horse germs if they didn’t deliberately come over to us. This also means that I don’t feel like I should have run it by the school.  And lastly, the pony is an ex-riding school pony. It has been surrounded by kids it’s whole life and used to do kids birthday parties and everything. I know animals are unpredictable but I was 99.999% sure that the pony would be fine and actually just appreciate the fuss off the tiny humans (he absolutely did)",

So the kids kept trying to get me not to date since it will affect their dad. It was an awful time since to the kids I was still responsible for what he did and reacted to things.In the end I just kept my dating on the low end which wasn’t hard since it wasn’t introducing the kids to the men anyways. All I had to change was not posting on social media. Also yes I sent the kids to therapy. They all stopped when they hit 18 or my middle child refused to talk so I pulled him.The oldest is now 25 and youngest is 21 and I got proposed too. I sat them down and told them, they were not happy and were pissed I was doing this to dad. Lots of talked later and I thought it was good. The wedding is in two weeksI got a text from all the kids saying they will not be at my wedding, that they need to support dad during this time. I had enough and texted them that if they do not go to my wedding it will damage our relationship and I will not be attending there own weddings when they get married.They were pissed and it started an argument and all of them think I am huge jerk.

Most of her friends are from outside of school.At school, however, she struggles making friends. Cleo has ADHD and was bullied in 3rd and 4th grade for some of that. While it was brought under control by 5th (current grade), these kids still don’t play with her and pretty much ice her out. While I don’t think they have to play with her, it also means that she doesn’t socialize a lot at school. She’s okay with this.Her teacher says our daughter often plays alone at recess or reads.  My wife and I were not very concerned and explained she’s very social and active afterwards.Cleo is a huge reader. She’s currently reading her way through my wife’s collection of books from her childhood. She loves them and treasures them, knowing they were her mama’s and wants to take great care of them. She came home on Tuesday, very upset and worried her mom would be upset with her. I asked why and she said her teacher took her book away and won’t give it back until tomorrow. When pressed for more information , she said she was reading at recess. Her teacher walked over, took the book and told her to go play. My daughter begged for her book back and the teacher refused.I quickly assured Cleo that she wasn’t in trouble and even called my wife at work to have her back me up. It was quite concerning that she was so afraid, as my wife isn’t one to fly off the handle. She’s always gentle with Cleo. As suspected, my wife assured her she wasn’t upset and that Cleo did zero wrong.The next day, I brought Cleo to school early and walked her to class, no one but the teacher was there. I told the teacher to give me the book. She obliged and tried to defend herself. I told her to save it and she had no right. There is no rule that Cleo has to do physical activity at recess and we expressed no concern. The teacher said she was allowed to set boundaries for her class but I pointed out recess was free time. It’s not like Cleo is reading during math. We went back and forth, and finally I said I’d be reaching out to the principal.The issue was resolved quickly. I don’t know the particulars, except the principal told me that Cleo is allowed to read at recess and unless she is actively harming someone or reading during a non-designated time, she wouldn’t have any more books confiscated. My wife and I were pleased. Cleo even more so.My cousin is a teacher at this school, just a different grade. She says what I did is “hot gossip” in the teacher’s lounge and that I have been marked as “one of those parents”. She says the teacher isn’t paid enough and I should’ve just accepted the rule. When I pointed out we only have 2 more months left at this school (Cleo is our only and starts junior high in august), that’s not a concern.My wife and I feel justified, but we are wondering if I’m an asshole?",

	"body" : "Throwaway from privacy.I (35F) own a small bakery. I'm very happy with it and proud of my work. I have two employees who work part time and for the most part it's just me.My SIL approached me at the beginning of the summer and asked if I would let my niece (F11) help out in the bakery over the school break. She has been getting really into baking and loves watching content creators baking and was apparently just dying to be able to job shadow/help out in a bakery.I was hesitant, but said yes. And I hated it. Every single minute that her niece spent in my bakery this summer was the only time I've ever had any regrets opening my business. Whatever the opposite of helpful was, that was what my niece was. My employees didn't enjoy her being there, and I didn't enjoy her being there at all. We were three very grumpy people all summer. I had hopes that she would get better, but she didn't.She started back to school last this week and I have never felt so relieved. I thought many times about telling my SIL that she couldn't come back during the summer, but since I had made the promise, I kept up with it.My SIL stopped by the house yesterday to drop something off for my husband. She told me my niece had absolutely loved her experience this summer and wanted to know if she could come back a couple Saturdays a month. I told her that unfortunately that wasn't going to work and that going forward I didn't think it was a good idea for my niece to help out. I told her it just wasn't productive for us.My SIL was very unhappy. She told me that my niece had loved her summer at the bakery and was so looking forward to continuing. I told her that I was sorry, but I had a business to run and couldn't continue having her help out. This dissolved into a shouting match that my husband eventually broke up. My SIL and MIL have been sending me nasty messages about \"breaking a girl's heart.\" My husband said my niece called him and was very upset, but he stands by me and understands that I can't let this bring down my workplace.So am I being the asshole?",

	"body" : "First, to our community: we’re sorry that it had to come to this. This post explains why we’ve made this decision, so we’d like to take this as an opportunity to explain why this matters to us so much.We love reddit. Not the company, but the community that’s able to exist here. This is a platform that has provided so many meaningful spaces to connect with others. Connecting to share, to entertain, to support, to find belonging. Sometimes to help too. Redditors are capable of doing great things when they come together. Redditors have raised money for countless causes, from r/freefolk raising over $130,000, to the dank charity alliance raising over $25,000 (with reddit support!) and so many more, contributed to the world’s largest secret santa gift exchange, r/askhistorians held actual historical conferences, and just so much more. To see the positive impact you, the users of this community, have had on people, look no further than updates where those that have posted share that firsthand. This is why we moderate, and why we pour countless volunteer hours into maintaining this space. We know reddit is capable of doing so much more good, which makes the recent failures of the company hurt even worse.A big part of what makes this possible is the diversity that exists here. It’s the diverse people and communities on Reddit that make it unique. This means accessibility for everyone, and also the freedom to access and interact with reddit in different ways. There are diverse mod tools that support the diverse communities to customize their subs to do fun and unique things. Several of those tools are unavailable on mobile, unless you’re using a third party app. Without this diversity, Reddit would feel flat and boring. Or it could look like the comments here where you can’t meaningfully participate and bots dominate.Feeling lucky? See if automod thinks you’re the asshole. Comment “AITA?” on this post. Nothing more, nothing less. Automod will give you your verdict. Do these answers feel completely unrelated to your concerns? We know how that feels. This is the future of reddit if the underlying issues that lead to these poor decisions aren’t seriously addressed.Why did we set the sub restricted rather than private? In both cases no one is able to post, but setting it to private means that anyone that hasn’t been following this closely won’t know why. Users already aware and participating in the protest won’t be using reddit during this period anyway. We thought it best to continue to use our platform to increase visibility of the issues we're facing",

There is nothing that can wake me up short of being attacked by a bear or shaken or something. It’s been that way since way before my wife and I had kids. Babies crying or screaming do not wake me up. They didn’t even when we had our first (8m) so usually I’ve woken up when my wife turns on the lights for changing and stuff like that. Apparently I sleep through A LOT when my wife is getting up a lot, so she is saying she does an “unfair amount” of work at night because of it. I feel bad because I recognize that if I’m asleep I’m not contributing to the night stuff. So I asked my wife to wake me up when the baby wakes up, and she told me that made it so much worse and that it was like “weaponized incompetence.” She just doesn’t want to wake me up for some reason. I am not WEAPONIZING my heavy sleep against her, I just want her to wake me up so I can help.

However, I did NOT ask for this and honestly I freaking hate the color as it does not match anything in my place and it's also too big. I gave it to my friend who liked it and was moving to a different state. My boyfriend then got me a cute black standmixer that fit into my apartment a lot better so that's what I have.My dad was over last night and he noticed that the grey standmixer was gone and replaced by the black one. He asked where it was and I told him the truth (namely, that I thought the grey was ugly so I gave it to my friend and my boyfriend got me the black one instead).My dad was shocked and said the grey standmixer had cost a lot and that he thought I would have liked it so that's why he gave it to me as a present. Maybe here's where I'm the AH: I said if he would have been more observant, he would have known that I absolutely hate the color grey (it's my least favorite color) and everyone in my life who knows me knows that.I honestly wasn't trying to be rude, I was just stating a fact. But my mom called me today and told me I really hurt my dad and need to apologize for \"throwing away\" a thoughtful birthday gift my dad had put a lot of money and thought into.I don't think that's necessary, I think after my dad gave me the standmixer, it became mine and I could do anything with it. And I didn't \"throw it away\", I gave it to a friend.So AITA?edit: okay so clearly I'm the asshole. I'll apologize to my dad. I didn't think it was such a big deal. But clearly I'm wrong.

As a graduate I have access but they also have community hours when people from the town can pay and swim.It doesn’t do lane swimming but typically everyone knows to stay away from those doing laps. I was doing laps at the far end with the pool wall on my side so I couldn’t move if I wanted to.I was mid session when two women my age jumped right in front of me and just stood there by the wall on the shallow end. I couldn’t stop in time and pushed from the wall between them forcing them to move aside.I was being more careful next lap but they just kept standing there. There was plenty of space on the other side of the pool where they could stand and chat without bothering anyone but they chose to stand right in front of me.So I continued swimming pushing from the wall. If they refused to move, I just turned in water making sure to make a big splash.I took a break to drink some water and one of them started screaming at me how I got her hair all wet. Told her it’s her fault and continued swimming.She waited for me in the changing rooms and went on about how I was inconsiderate and I ruined her hair.I told her to fuck off. She started going off at me and started screaming calling me an asshole an a bitch.I grabbed my stuff and went to one of the cubicles to have a shower and change.

Now, with my sister agreeing I worry that I might have been. AITA?Edit: just to add, I was the only person there when they came in. They had the whole pool to stand, they chose to purposefully stand in front of me, without swimming at all.Edit2: the pool is 25m long and you swim length wise, from deep to shallow end and back. They had whole shallow end wall free except for the meter or so I used for kicking off. I didn’t take the whole shallow end. who would do laps there (except for kids)?Edit3: while there’s no designated lap lanes, lap swimming isn’t forbidden. Typically, during open swim, 75% of swimmers do lap swimming.Edit4: they weren’t older ladies, they were about my age (early30s)Edit5: i didn’t leave the pool to grab water, I had water on the edge along with my other stuff for drills or my ear plugs, etc. This is perfectly normal and acceptable.",

My husband (24M) and I went to a basket raffle at our local library this past weekend, with my sister, Bracken, Neville, Bracken’s girlfriend (13F), and my sister’s husband (33M).This raffle is held every year and has many local businesses and organizations donate baskets to help raise funds for the library. There are all sorts of baskets from free messages to gift cards to sports jerseys and so much more. Bracken got some tickets for all of the sports related ones, he plays baseball and has done this every year, and he’s been pretty successful in the past. Bracken then went around with his gf.I was hanging out with my husband, sister and rest of the family while looking at the baskets, when Bracken and his gf came back to us. Shortly after this, while still looking at the baskets, we saw some science-y baskets, with projects and books for kids and adults. This type of stuff is what Neville likes, it was going fine until in that section, they had a few baskets that were aimed at girls in science/STEM.When Neville saw the baskets, he called them stupid and started making some pretty awful comments about how girls are “too dumb” for science and that’s why they needed special baskets. He made some more comments like, “this is why robotics club is all boys”. My husband and I just dismissed it, but we could see a few people giving us looks, and Bracken made a comment telling Neville to shut his mouth.The raffle happened, Bracken won a lot, the rest of us didn’t. On the car ride home, my hubby and I were asking each other where Neville could have learned that language and we were stumped.Last night, I got a call from my sister and she seemed stress, she was telling me about how horrible Neville’s first month of middle school was. She was telling me he was being targeted and bullied. I asked her to explain what happened, and she was just crying, I asked if she could give the phone to someone else. She gave it to Bracken, who told us that she wasn’t telling the truth. He said that kids were mocking Neville for what he said at the raffle. Bracken admitted he was telling his friends about it, who then spread it around to the 6th graders. Some of the kids in Neville’s grade were calling him creepy and weird, and were doing it to his friends as well, who defended his comments. My sister quickly grabbed the phone from him after.After she calmed down, she asked me what to do. I told her that this was on her and her fault for not correcting Neville’s behavior. She said that she didn’t know why he said it, and said that she “can’t just take away his phone or friends” when I mentioned both as a possible source. She just doubled down and said she needed to “teach Bracken and his friends not to gossip”. I told her she was being ridiculous and hung up.

I have heard too many horror stories about a family getting a pet and then the person who did not want it being stuck caring for it.I finally agreed on three conditions. One, smaller than sixty pounds, we do not need a mastiff. Two, a non shedding dog only. None of us are allergic, I just don't want extra work. Three, for sixty days in a row they had to collect all the garbage from all the trash cans in the house and put it in the big garbage bin. That was to make sure they would remember to feed a dog every day. And for sixtrt days they, all three of them, had to go for a one mile walk twice a day. With the GPS route tracker active.  If they missed a day they had to start over.The longest they have made it so far is two weeks.My parents called me up to say I was being ridiculous and petty. I 100% agreed with them. But since they always side with the kids I was ready for them. I sent them a link for a dog walking service in my area. It is very reasonable. I said if they wanted a say in the dog decision they had to agree to set up an account with that company and that I could call up the company for help whenever their precious, perfect, grandchildren and son-in-law forgot to take care of the dog.  They said I was being a jerk and that they had the right to their opinion.  I agreed that they had that.

My daughter was super sick from morning sickness and Debbie told her she looked disgusting and stop taking attention off of her.My son who was best man to the groom (his brother) had his wife seated with some cousins across the room at the reception and not at the family table because she wasn’t immediate family.  We did not know this until the reception and tried to have her moved back with our table and Debbie said no it’s her day.

She said the wedding was going to be at a beach near our city, and it will completely be held in the sand: basically a 35 person ceremony right by the water followed by a bonfire and barbecue also in the sand. She said she just wanted to let me know before she sent the official invite because of Mia.I truly have never been more shocked and disappointed in my sister.

And now she’s only telling me because it’s set in stone and there’s nothing she can change. I tried explaining how hurtful this is to Mia because Mia loves her auntie, but she’ll be absolutely heartbroken not being able to attend the wedding. It’s already so difficult raising a child with disabilities without a partner, but when even family is this inconsiderate and cruel, it’s truly the worst feeling.Cassidy immediately started deflecting saying her and Max checked to make sure the beach had a sand friendly wheelchair for me to rent ($110/day) … the audacity to ask your guests to be paying just to make it to the event (especially when she knows I cannot afford this). Then she said how she will not change the location because her and Max met on this very beach and it has been their dream ever since to get married here after they also got engaged here.When I suggested she pay for the rental, she kept saying how her and Max already had to cut so much out of their budget and plans because they also can’t afford much. Like you’re already paying for a whole wedding, but can’t afford a rental for your FAMILY to come? I was talking to some moms of children with disabilities and they all agree that it sounds like Cassidy doesn’t even want Mia there and is using all of this as an excuse.

And I have no idea where they’ve been or what their clothes have been exposed to.About a month ago, I bought a bunch those clear disposable rain coats and I started telling people who I invited over that they could bring a change of fresh clothes to change into or wear one of the coats before they sit on my furniture. I also offer to wash the clothes that they change out of, if they want to.My girlfriend doesn’t have a problem with this and started just leaving clothes at my place. My mom and my little sister have also been okay with this new rule. But I invited a friend over yesterday (I told them about the clothes thing before they came) and when they got here they were surprised that I actually enforced it and said “You’ve got to f*cking with me”. I told them no, I’m serious and then they left. They haven’t been answering my messages either.I was talking to my mom about it today and she said it was pretty excessive and unreasonable to expect everybody to do. I disagree but Im kind of double guessing myself. Am I in the wrong here?",

	"title" : "AITA for blowing up on my husband over chicken alfredo?",
	"body" : "I (38F) am married to my husband (42M) we’ve been together since our early twenties and have three small children (all under 10) He’s a mechanic and works anywhere from 60 to 80 hours a week, while I work as a hostess 3 days a week at a restaurant while the kids are at school. I do the majority of the housework and childcare and I don’t mind as I understand he has a hard job and works a lot. He gets the kids on the bus every morning because he leaves for work about 10 minutes afterward. All I ask of him is to do his laundry as his clothes are covered in oil and grime and need to go in by themselves and pick up after himself because the kids destroy the house enough. A couple times a week he’ll help with dinner and cleanup at the end of the day as well.Over the last 2 months, he’s completely stopped helping. He dumps his clothes on the laundry room floor, his half of the bedroom is a mess, he leaves cans and wrappers all over the living room and he’s even stopped getting the kids up which has upset them as they love their mornings with dad. He’s also been coming home hours later than usual. I’ve been letting it slide as he seems very stressed out, but a few days ago he snapped at me for being a “shitty wife” for letting his clothes go unwashed. I reminded him that he always did his own laundry, and he hadn’t asked me to do it (I’ve been doing it I just hadn’t gotten to it yet) He just grumbled and went to go watch TV.Last night I made chicken alfredo, we have it about once a week because the kids love it and no one’s ever complained. Well, he bitched and moaned through the whole dinner. Said that since I’m not taking care of the house I should at least put a good meal on the table, that I’ve just been letting the whole family go to shit and I should be ashamed of myself for treating him and his children like that. Called me a bad wife and mother in front of our children. I told the children to go to their rooms and snapped, I screamed at him about how much I do for the household, that if it wasn’t for me the place would be trashed and he has no right to treat me like this over chicken alfredo. We went back and forth for a while before he left, and I have no idea where he went and he isn’t answering my calls or texts.I feel bad now, as I shouldn’t have reacted like that, especially because I know he’s just stressed from work, but it all just kind of built up and came out at once. I just want to know if I was wrong for freaking out on him like that.Update: I called my husband for the 100th time because he still hadn’t come home and the kids wanted to know where he was, and a woman answered. I didn’t recognize her voice and he doesn’t have a sister. I asked her to put me on the phone with my husband and she asked who I was, I said I was his wife and she laughed into the phone and told me he was busy. We went back and forth, with her laughing at me the whole time before telling her she’ll send him home soon and hanging up.It’s now the next morning and he’s still not home. I really didn’t think he was cheating, I had really hoped this was just a rough patch but it looks like most of you were right. I’m heartbroken and a little in shock and not really sure what to do right now. My brother said I should come stay with him, and I might, or maybe just bring the kids so they don’t have to see us fight. I might update again or I might not, but I’m sure you all know where this is heading anywayUpdate #2: He came home a few hours after I last updated, I immediately confronted him about the woman answering, he denied cheating and said it was one of his friends messing with me because he stayed at a friend’s house and they must’ve answered his phone. I told him I don’t believe him and to pack some things and leave because I want a divorce. He blew up at this, telling me it was his home (my parents bought us the house when we got married) and that he was not going to leave. We argued for a while until I called my brother. My brother lives about 20 minutes away so he got to the house very quick and once he got there my husband calmed down and packed a bag. Once he was gone my brother helped me contact a divorce lawyer.My brother and his wife check in with us every day, We’re all safe and I’ve had very minimal contact with my now ex husband. I probably won’t update again.",

	"title" : "AITA for telling my sister I would say \"I told you so\" if she gets cancer?",
	"body" : "(sorry for errors, English is not my native language)I (f27) really enjoy motocross, and although I'm an amateur I spend a lot of my time and money on it. My sister (f31) has always kinda despised the sport. She is always saying that it's dangerous and that I shouldn't be doing it because I will get hurt. Three weeks ago I fell on a jump and broke my ankle and shattered my knee. It is still unsure what kind of recovery I will make, and I was (and still kinda am) mentally in a bad place as well. Like I said, I really love drifting around on my motorcycle and I would be devastated if I can never do it again.When my sister came to visit me at the hospital, the first thing she said to me was \"I told you this would happen.\"I was shocked by this, especially because she did not say anything else after that. No empthay or compassion at all, it almost seemed like she was happy to finally be proven right.Now onto the part where I think I might be the asshole. For context, my sister has been smoking cigarettes for the past 14 years. I have never really said anything bad about it, except for when she asked about it or tried to convince me of the benefits of it. So when she said \"I told you so\" to me at the hospital, I replied with \"nice response, I wil remember it for when you get lung cancer.\"She got incredibly upset, called me a bitch and left. I have not spoken to her since, but I have gotten some angry texts from our parents saying that I crossed the line. I don't stand behind what I said because I would never do that to her if she would get lung cancer, but I meant it more as an example to show how insensitive her comment was. AITA?TLDR; I injured my leg during motocross and my sister said \"I told you so\", so I said that I would say the same thing to her if she gets cancer for smokingEdit: I did not expect so many responses! Thank you to everyone that replied. I am doing well with the recovery so far. It might be a while before I am able to walk but I have a great healthcare plan and an even better support system.As for the post, I agree that my comment was pretty bad and that it was childish to be like \"but hers was worse\". I don't know why she said what she said and nothing else, but I send her a message asking if we can talk about it. It would be nice to have her by my side.Also some people asked me about the benefits of smoking; she says it helps her deal with stress and that it's a great way to meet new people when stepping outside to smoke. I also want to add that I do care that she smokes and that I have talked to her about the risks, I meant in the post that I don't mention it unprompted every time she lights a cigarette, only when she brings it up.Last thing, I absolutely do not wish cancer on her or anyone. And it definitely does not matter if they smoke or not, no one on this earth deserves it. I am sorry, and I hope I did not hurt anyone with my post.",

	"body" : "My family have always had this tradition where the first child born after the loss of someone in the family gets the late family member's name as their middle name. My sister and I both have those middle names. Hers is Patricia after a cousin of our mom's and mine is Denise after my dad's aunt.Almost a year ago my sister lost her 2 day old son, Philip. He was the last family member we lost and it was a huge, earth shattering blow for our family.I found out I was pregnant a few months ago. I waited a while to tell anyone and my sister was the first person we told, privately. When I told her she said it would be nice to have some positive news to focus on and she wanted me to continue the tradition our family keeps and give my baby, if a boy, the middle name Philip. She was so happy about the idea. It surprised me a lot. I would have figured she would not be okay with it. But she wanted it.The problem is my husband and I do not want to continue with the tradition. We do not want to give our son the middle name Philip. The name isn't one either of us likes or would ever pick ourselves... We have not announced the sex of our baby yet but my husband and I know we are expecting a boy.My family were saying how amazing it will be if my baby is a boy and Philip's name can be carried on... I suggested they wait until we announce the sex and the name before jumping to conclusions. They asked why and I said we were thinking of not continuing with the tradition. My family, and by that I mean my parents mostly, were really upset. My sister was the worst though. She asked why I wouldn't want to honor Philip and why it was him the tradition was getting broken on. She asked if I saw him as meaning so little and I said no, of course not. Then she asked if it was his name and we didn't like it. She said she really hoped it wasn't that. I said we just didn't feel like the tradition was something we wanted to continue.The decision has brought up a lot of bad feelings and my sister is especially angry and thinks I'm being insensitive and showing how little I care for my nephew. I feel terrible. She's so angry at me and my parents are unhappy as well. My husband hates them for putting this pressure on us. He said we should be allowed to name our son what we want and we should not be obliged to use a certain name. I never wanted to be an asshole but my family believes I am.AITA?",

	"body" : "I (22f) have been friends with Danny (22m) since high school and he recently moved in with his current gf Lucy (22f). They had a housewarming party on Friday and Lucy spent most of the night dancing with her own friends who are very like her (excitable extroverted e.g) and dragging Danny away from his conversations with us (his friends) to dance even though he's more like us (introverted not party animals)Later Danny was being quiet so I asked if he was okay and he said just tired, but he just kept watching Lucy dancing and then said something in her ear the next time she came over and she just shook her head and laughed at him. After she went back to her friends I asked if it was bothering him how she was behaving and he asked me to explain. I mentioned the attention seeking dancing and the fact she was wearing something really revealing even though other guys were at this party. Danny said it didn't bother him then sat with a moody face.At the end of the night Lucy sat down with us and started chatting non stop about how amazing the party had been. I pointed out jokingly Danny obviously wasn't enjoying himself since he looked miserable, and Danny told her I was worried he was jealous because of her outfit. Lucy ruffled his hair (which he hates) and said he was quiet because he loved her outfit so much he couldn't wait for us all to leave so he could \"drag\" her to bed. I thought that was completely inappropriate and said to Danny in that case I'd leave if she was just going to be disgusting and Lucy just laughed at me so I did leave.Today Danny has messaged me saying Lucy wants an apology before I'm allowed back at their home but when I asked if Lucy will apologize for making me uncomfortable he said no she doesn't have anything to be sorry about.I was genuinely only worried about my friend but admit I could have just left without calling her disgusting so AITA?ETA - to clarify I didn't say the comment about her clothes directly to Lucy, I asked Danny once then never mentioned it again. I asked him because I know in the past he's said anything overly sexual makes him uncomfortable. He's not the kind of guy who makes innuendos or anything Also I'm in no way jealous of Lucy, she's the opposite of how I'd want to be (which is fine people can be who they want) and Danny and I already tried dating years ago but the spark wasn't there and it was uncomfortable after we tried being intimate and we BOTH agreed we were better as completely platonic friends",

Now I feel horrible because clearly he couldn't handle taking care of the kids for this long by himself and I feel like an asshole and don't want this to ruin my marriage.Do you all think I'm an asshole for the way I acted?",

His brother, Jay, had asked the day before if him and his family (wife + 3 kids) could come over on Sunday to swim after one of the kids’ sports games, which was at a park close by to us.Now, fiancé and I own a business together that requires WFH (work from home) on Sundays. Everyone that we know is aware of this, including his brother. I voiced my opinion that I felt it was weird for people to be at our house while we were working in the basement, but fiancé assured that it would just be chill. He said it’s normal for family to use people’s pools even if they weren’t home.So, we let them come thinking that they would swim for maybe an hour then leave. But it wasn’t just them. Fiancé’s parents also came (we figured they would), but the kicker is that Jay also invited 2 of his friends plus their partners and their kids as well. We do know these people but both fiancé and I were not aware of this beforehand.So now it’s a full on party in our backyard while we are working in the basement. I became very annoyed that they did not only invite themselves but some of their friends as well. It made me feel guilty that I couldn’t be in my own backyard to host people because I was working. It also felt like they were just using the house and didn’t really care about seeing us, the homeowners. Not to mention, the house was a complete mess. We had a busy Friday and Saturday and I didn’t bother cleaning much before because I figured it would just be Jay’s family.Everyone was here from 1:00 PM til 7:00 PM. We finished work around 3:00 PM, at which time fiancé put on his swim trunks to join them outside. I got in a pretty bitter mood from it all and stayed inside. I didn’t say hello to anyone cause I figured they weren’t even here to see me, just my pool. I did some laundry and some cleaning up and I did end up seeing a few people who were coming inside to use the washrooms. I said hi and tried to make some small talk but I really wasn’t happy.Fiancé came in and said that I was creating an awkward/unwelcoming atmosphere by not being outside. I told him I never planned to have a party today so I was just carrying on doing what I originally had planned which was laundry and cleaning.Fiancé keeps saying that I was rude for not joining them outside after work. He also says things like “the pool is meant to be used” and that “it’s family time”. AITA?ETA: answering those who have asked, we bought this house together completely 50/50Second edit: I may sound like an uptight witch from this story but I’m not uptight enough to call off the whole marriage because of this  Please stop judging my relationship based on one little story and telling me our impending marriage is doomed.",

I (23) also don't have children but my partner & I hope to have some in the future. Oldest sister lives overseas with her husband and so is mostly irrelevant in this situation - her and sister 3 don't speak.Anyway, sister 3 is having a childfree wedding. She is, like, aggressively childfree. We don't really get along.So, basically, our parents are old farts (lol love them) and can no longer drive. I can't drive, either, but my husband can, as can my older sister. She's a single mom, though, and had no one to watch her kids.My husband & soon to be BIL hate each other. They grew up together and theres just lots of hard feelings there, so my husband wasn't going to the wedding. I was going to have him drop me off.In the end, last weekend, after months of anxiety, I said I would stay with the kids so my parents and sister could go. She will drive them and attend in my place. Once we decided my husband gave the okay to work on the day of the wedding.My sister lost it at that. Then decided she would have someone else drive our parents and asked me to come. I told her no, my older sister wants to go - I'd rather her there, anyway, as if one of our parens falls or something she knows what to do.Sister lost it and said I was being selfish. This is where I may be the asshole;I then told her I didn't see the point in going to an event half the family would be missing from (referencing the kids).She said it shouldn't matter to me, because I don't have kids. I then said they were better company than her & point blank refused to attend her wedding. Even if the kids have a babysitter, which sister is now offering to pay for, I wouldn't go.She's so upset. I feel a little bad, but not much.My oldest sister says I'm in the right, second sister says she feels really bad. Our parents aren't really acknowledging the situation. I think they just want to see their daughter get married.AITA?I can definitely see both sides of this and I'm conflicted. The more I think about it the closer I get to apologising and offering to go, even though I don't want to.ETA; Everyone who was asking about the drama between my husband & BIL - here you go. I had to get permission from my SIL before I could share.My SIL (husbands sister) and soon to be BIL (sisters almost husband) dated in high-school. He got her pregnant and dipped. He tried to force an abortion on her, accused her of cheating, the whole shebang.When she had the baby she had a DNA test done and sued him for child support. The entire time he was slating her name, making her feel horrible - tried to force her to put their son up for adoption.When their son was five months old he passed away due to an undetected medical issue. She was suffering, hospitalised.BIL made a post about being free from the shackles of his \"bank draining baby mama\" and went on a partying streak to celebrate. Insists that she's a bad mom, even now, and has never once visited his sons grave (and skipped his funeral). Didn't tell his own family members that he'd passed away and they also missed his funeral.My husband fucking hates him. He ended up having to work overtime to help pay for the funeral as a fifteen year old because BIL refused to step up. He doesn't even acknowledge his son.My SIL is still recovering, no thanks to him, but has welcomed a baby girl in the past year and she is an amazing mom.The term \"bad blood\" is an understatement.",

For the most part things like vacations and where we bought a house are decided based on what she can afford, but there have been several times I've paid in full for vacations to places I really enjoy and wanted to share the experience with her.She has a 23y/o son from her previous marriage. When she and I got together I told her I wouldn't mind paying extra for things here and there until her son was 18 and working or in school so she could take care of him. For the majority of our relationship, he has lived with his father. He decided against college or trade school and hasn't expressed any interest in starting to figure out a plan for the immediate future let alone his life. He floats from job to job, and his father is pretty much the same since the kid graduated. Therein lies the problem: every few months they'll call her for a few hundred dollars here, a few hundred there, 20 bucks this week, 80 the next. Sometimes it's her son calling for help, sometimes it's her ex-husband. This has caused her to be short on funds for our plans, or things she volunteered to cover on more than one occasion. Her reasoning when its her ex asking is that since their son still lives with him, she has to help him. I get that to a point.We were supposed to go on a vacation later this month. Nothing major or fancy but just time away. We had agreed to split the cost and all that was left to pay for were the hotels, rental car, and some reservations. Her ex-husband called needing help getting his car out of impound and getting caught up on rent. Their son hasn't been able to get to work without the car because he doesn't want to ride a bike or take a bus. Almost 5 grand later they're set up but my wife told me she can't pay for her portion of our vacation, so I told her I was canceling it. She called me a heartless ass, that she's just taking care of her son and we've been arguing over it but my stance is this: they're both able-bodied adults that keep making a series of life decisions that keep them at a stand still (like quitting jobs over little things, smoking, going out) and her always digging them out of their hole is starting to impact our lives more and more, and I didn't sign up for that. AITA for canceling our vacation instead of just footing the entire cost myself?***To clarify: She contributes 30% of her pay to our joint expenses: bills/utilities, emergency fund, retirement. 70% of her pay she keeps for her personal expenses and to spend or save how she wishes. Dates, vacations, and fun things we choose to do together are budgeted and planned based on what we can afford from our personal funds. Pool that money together than pay together.",

She presented me with two \"options\" when I don't have to do either.

	"body" : "I 23f am currently 8 months pregnant. We had been keeping it a secret and planned to tell people around this time, but a few months after my pregnancy my SIL26 found out she was pregnant, and then it just felt awkward to announce. We wanted to wait for the right time. I’ve been with married to my Husband for only 6 months, but we’ve been together on and off since we were 14 (permanently together since we were 16)When we were 17, we found out I was pregnant I had complications, I gave birth to my preemie stillborn at 25 weeks. So this pregnancy we’ve been extra cautious, and secretive. I haven’t seen family much these past few months and I carry small, but as I developed a bump I’ve been wearing hoodies and loose clothing. With that I kind of just looked like I gained weight.We were hesitant on me going, I was just going to send my husband with a gift of mine, but SIL said she really wanted me there. I decided to try my best to hide the bump and go.It was all going well, no one noticed, I mean I got a few looks but no one asked me anything. Then about an hour in I started having tiny cramps, that eventually got more aggressive. I told my husband we need to leave I need to go to the hospital. As We we’re walking a sharp pain hit me and I grabbed the picnic table next to me and almost stumbled over causing attention to myself. I really thought I was in labor, the pains were getting so intense. People started surrounding us, asking what was the matter and my husband says “She’s pregnant, guys she pregnant, something’s goin on, we have to leave.” He was panicked himself. He rushed me to the hospital.By the time we got the hospital my pains had subsided, they said it was false labor. My husband and I both had angry texted messages from SIL and other guest at the party about us hiding the pregnancy,how messed up it was, and how they couldn’t believe I showed up pregnant and was secret about it. How I had a “babystunt” at someone else’s shower Just a lot of not nice text. Not one asking if I was alright.",

She does yoga 3 times a week and is incredibly flexible and agile. She told me she would talk to her sister as she's a personal trainer. I agreed, my girlfriend,myself, and her younger sister as the teacher have been doing yoga twice a week at my house for the last 3 weeks. I feel fantastic and really feel that it has been helping me.Yesterday, my mother called me asking me if I was still going to give her the freezer I no longer used. I said yes and told her to come get it or I would take it to her the next day. The freezer is in my garage where we do yoga. I usually do it shirtless and my girlfriend and her sister are in sports bra and sweats.In the middle of our yoga session I get a notification that someone was at my front door, it was my mom and dad . I headed to the door while putting on a shirt but I asked my girlfriend and her sister to put on a top also. My girlfriend gave me daggers for eyes and her sister gave me a confused \"who the hell are you\" look.I said please because my parents were coming in. I let my parents in and when I come back, they still are in their sports bras. My parents greet them and leave shortly after. My girlfriends sister ends up leaving before we finish the session and told me that I am no longer her client because she's the teacher and she felt I  disrespected her.I was confused and asked my girlfriend what she meant. She said \"dude, she has big boobs. She gets shitted on like that all the time. You need to apologize like now. I'll let it go but you're a dick\" I told her I will clear things up with her sister but I will no apologize because I didn't mean it that way. My girlfriend doesn't believe me and thinks I was trying to police her and her sister.I did start to think about it and her sister is a good person and am thinking I did overstep the boundaries.

Everything is going great and I love him so much. I can't wait to spend my life with him. He loves my family, and I, for the most part, love his.A bit of background, fiance has a much older brother. While my future MIL was pregnant three times in between them, all of them resulted in late miscarriages and stillbirths. As a result, MIL put all of her motherly love and attention on fiance. He had never tried a fruit or vegetable before I met him because his parents never made him when he was young and he had grown up assuming they were gross. (I got him to try some and he loves them now.)As we were planning our guest list, we consulted our families about which, and how many, relatives we should invite. Future MIL asked that we \"invite\" fiance's dead brother and sisters. When we asked what she meant, she wanted us to put up a framed photo of the dead babies in the pews at our wedding ceremony, and then save them seats at our reception.I was horrified. First of all, we are trying to have a fairly small wedding to start with, and a beautiful, intimate venue. We can only have seats for 30-50 people, and I would like these places to be for our friends and family, not people who have never met either of us because they are dead. Fiance agrees that three of 50 seats reserved for dead people is too many. He suggested we compromise and just let MIL put up all three photos in one seat.Personally, I think it's gross and weird to include any of them. We're starting our lives together. We want to have a family and it almost seems like a bad omen, but it means a lot to her and it's a fairly small ask. Fiance's parents are paying for 75% of our wedding, and this is the only request she's had. So AITA for still refusing?",

	"body" : "my daughter who is 27 is getting married in August. She hasn't invited my wife or our children. I'm very hurt and I told her that since my family wasn't welcome, I shouldn't be welcome too. She was angry with me and has called me crying saying that I'm an ah for doing this to her since who is going to walk her down the isle?My daughter was a happy child until she was 13 and her mum and I divorced. She was devastated and we did everything from therapy etc. She couldn't fathom what was going on since we were a happy family. I met my beautiful wife 4 years later and it was the second blow to her, since she lived with the hope that her mum and I would reconcile. She never liked my wife even with the effort from the later to have a relationship. Now my wife and our small children aren't welcome to her wedding. Every one else is invited including her mums new BF and his sons.She Told me that she was free to invite whoever she wanted on her big day and I totally agree with her and support her decision but then Shouldn't I also be free to decline the invitation? Why am I being the AH here?_________updateThanks everyone, as I expected nobody is an AH here. I understand that my daughter doesn't  like my family and I wish that I knew how to tackle this situation earlier. I thought I was doing the right thing giving her space. When my ex told that she wasn't in love with me anymore and that she wanted to see other people, we got a divorce and we didn't tell my daughter the reason. When my  my ex changed her mind  a year later and  wanted a reconciliation, for the sake of our daughter. Everyone told me that we were meant to be together and that I should forgive and take her (my ex) back including my own family and friends. For your daughters sake. The thing was, I had fallen out of love with my ex by then. Nobody forgave me and my daughter grew up listening to our family blaming me for the divorce. I always kept showing my daughter that she was my only priority and with time I even told her what really happened, hoping she would understand better how nuanced relationships are. Nobody was at fault and both her mum and I loved her very much. I don't know how I failed there or what more I should have done so she wouldn't resent me the way she did and still does. When I met wife, all my daughters hope for her parents to be together was now gone and she hated my wife. by then she was already 17 and it was harder for both my wife and I to try and have relationship with her.I didn't regret going against everyone when I didn't want my old marriage back, because I  believed and still believe that my decision was the right one.  I'm sorry to say I'm going to go against everyone now too including my wife and I'm not going to attend my daughters wedding. She has made zero effort to have any relationship with me since she moved out. She has refused to meet her two brothers and even now, she isn't that much interested in me attending as much as having her father walking her because it would be embarrassing otherwise. It's time my daughter learned that actions have consequences.To answer why my daughter doesn't have a beef with her mother's BF. I can only speculate but my ex met her partners a bit later in life, had she met someone while both my ex and I were single and my ex had chosen to move on, my daughter prob would blamed them for breaking her family instead. it just happened to be my beautiful wife that took the biggest chunk of the blame and resentment.ciao",

Also, no one asked me if my dish was vegetarian.So am I the AH here or are people just overreacting?Edit: Sinse so many people are asking. Nothing was labled. I just left the dish on the buffet table along with the rest of the dishes. There were many other meat dishes. About 20 people at the party, 4 were vegetarian.

She only lives a mile up the road from me and is on the way, so I've never asked her for a dime or accepted when she's offered me money.  From my perspective, I'm going there either way, and her overall household expenses are higher than my own, so it felt like the thing to do.Over the weekend, my car went to the shop.  I told my coworker that I wouldn't be available to give her a ride either Monday or Tuesday.  She said it wasn't a problem because her boyfriend is off this week and would give her a ride.  I asked if I could bum a ride as well.  I even offered to walk to her home so they wouldn't have to drive backwards.  She asked her boyfriend about it and he said he would, but he wanted $20 for the two days.I know it's just $20, but that set me off.  I declined the offer and said I'd find my own ride.  At work yesterday, she asked about my car.  I told her I'd be getting my car Tuesday night after work, but that going forward I'd like $30 a week (1/3 my gas costs) if she wanted to ride with me.  She was upset about this and said her boyfriend had only wanted money from me because by having me in the car he was being forced to drive straight home when he picked me up.  I pointed out that I've been happy to drive straight home to help her out for over a year and that it probably wouldn't have killed him to show me at least some level of appreciation.Today she said she'd no longer be riding with me after talking about it with her boyfriend.  She said she felt disappointed with me for holding his actions against her and that I was being petty.  A couple other coworkers told me through out the day that her boyfriend's just an asshole and she doesn't really have a say at home, but overall agreed with me that it was a dick move.  From my perspective, this dude directly benefits from me thanks to his girlfriend not needing a car of her own or spending a dime in travel, and my coworker should have defended me.Do you all think I'm being petty about this?",

	"body" : "Throwaway, some details changed, mobile so formatting, etc.I (33f) live with my brother (32m) and his new wife (34f). Things have been fine to a point, and I definitely appreciate them taking me in during my time of need. That is not lost on me, I recognize they did not have to help me and I am incredibly thankful that they have done that. But my SIL has baby fever and she is talking about trying to get pregnant.First of all, I know my brother had the snip after his divorce from his first wife. He would have to have the procedure reversed and his insurance will not cover it, and to be frank they cannot afford that. Part of why they allowed me to move in is because they are in financial trouble and I am contributing quite a lot of money to bills right now. I cover probably 2/3 of all the bills because my SIL doesn't work and my brother pays an ungodly amount of child support to his ex wife. The financial issues can go ahead and be another point in the situation.My SIL also can barely take care of herself. She sleeps most of the day. She does not clean, she does not cook, she doesn't take care of the child she already has... her daughter is 6 yrs old and she doesn't even interact with her unless she HAS to. That is a totally separate issue... I have become a live-in maid and nanny on top of working 45 or more hrs a week.My SIL lost custody of her other child about 2 yrs ago. He is 11 and living with family. I do not know why she even lost custody but he SAYS he was abused. She did not fight to get him back.2 days ago my brother told me he has an appointment to meet with his Doc to discuss the reversal so him and SIL can try for a baby... I told them they were out of their minds. It got explosive and I finally asked WHO was going to take care of a baby when my brother works full time, I work full time and she constantly makes excuses to not even do basic shit around the house like take the dog outside. She really had the nerve to tell me \"I thought you could handle them when you get off work before (brother) gets home so the load is evenly distributed.\" I blew up! I told her I am not going to be a parent to ANOTHER one of her kids and that if they really do this then I am totally done and they are on their own. I told my brother I would always love him and help him if he needs me but that I would never talk to SIL and make sure the rest of the family disowns her too. I think I was probably TA for saying that the way I did. She started crying and locked herself in the bedroom.My brother is threatening to kick me out and again I might be TA for this... I told him he can't afford to kick me out and he can't afford a replacement maid/nanny like I have been. I told our mom about what happened and she not only thinks I'm NTA but is now mad at my brother. Our dad however said I am TA because it isn't my place to say anything about my brother's decisions.So Reddit... AITA?ETA:I had to omit some things before publishing this post on account of the character limit. I do not know how that works with edits but I figure I'll find out in a moment here.1- I moved in over a year ago when I was down on my luck and unemployed. The conditions for me moving in was that I help around the house until I was back on my feet. Their financial situation changed, though, and they asked me to stay which is why I have been living with them this long. What I did NOT expect was to get almost 100% of the workload in the home in addition to working longer hours than my brother. We have had multiple conversations about how I felt it was unfair that I do so much and my SIL said they helped me, so I am obligated to help now. Had I known this would be thrown in my face I would have rather been homeless...2- I chose to be childfree but I love my step-niece and leaving at this point would hurt her the most. CPS has been called many times not even by myself but their friends and my brother's ex-wife because they feel my niece is being neglected. My ex-SIL specifically said emotional abuse and neglect, and that she had witnessed forms of humiliation in the past as punishment. My niece is definitely troubled. She has a therapist. I am really limited on what I can do when the people who are supposed to help just won't.3- I am still reading comments but I will reply as I can.",

Can't your stupid husband leave you alone??\" I didn't mean to say it out loud, but it slipped out and my sister looked at me angrily and literally dragged me into another room and asked \"Why tf did you say that?\"I told her that she and her husband have been pregnant every year for the last 8 years and that she needs to take a break. I was worried about her having so many babies in such a short time and I didn't want anything bad happening to her.She then said \"How about YOU leave us alone and worry about your own shit?

They pay me $30-$50/hour, but their kids are pretty destructive and they don't respect other adults like they're supposed to, so it's a full chore watching after them.I'm aware that the \"stupid husband\" comment was inappropriate, but I have almost no filter and my stupid mouth says shit before my brain can stop it.And ummm.... I've seen some comments talk about the ages and assuming my sister is 21? I'M 21f, my sister is 32f, and her husband is 33m.UPDATE). I apologized to my sister for insulting her husband and making that rude comment but I told her that I'm still worried about her having so many kids back to back and that  just concerned in general about her health and well-being.She actually forgave me, and she said it's because 1. I'm her youngest sister, 2. She knows about my problem with keeping my thoughts to myself and that I'm working on myself, and 3. She knows that I am concerned for her and she appreciates it, but she has assured me that she's fine and said that this pregnancy wasn't planned and her husband plans on getting a vasectomy because they both want this pregnancy to be the last.For those asking in the comments, she and her husband can afford to have kids. He runs a very successful business and she is still co-partner with her best friend in a company that they both started before she got married. How she manages to juggle being a full time mom and work here and there is beyond me, but she does. That's why I babysit sometimes when the nanny isn't available 24/7.Her husband was the one who initially wanted a big family and my sister just went along with the idea. But that's their business.",

They acted like they had never been told no or been forced to behave in their entire lives; Drawing on the walls with crayons and markers, trying to flush bath toys down the toilet, throwing themselves on the floor and screaming for candy, the list goes on and on.I called Mandy explaining what Nick and Mya were doing and that I was having them stand in the corner for a time-out. Mandy ended up coming home early, but not to deal with Nick or Mya. Instead, Mandy was angry with me and told me that I wasn’t allowed to discipline them because I’m not their mother and “need to learn my place.”The next weekend (last Friday), Mandy begged me to babysit Nick and Mya because she said she wanted to visit her mom again and couldn’t find another babysitter. My parents had me agree and Mandy told me again that I was not allowed to discipline Nick or Mya. (I’m pretty sure this is the real reason why she couldn’t get an actual babysitter for Nick and Mya.)Since Mandy said I couldn’t discipline them, I decided to do as I was told. I watched them to make sure they didn’t try to run away from home or anything, but otherwise left Nick and Mya to their own devices. The house was obviously a wreck by the time Mandy got home.Mandy was furious with me and tried convincing my parents not to pay me. My parents still paid me since a deal is a deal. But they said they were disappointed me with because even though Mandy’s no-discipline rule was silly, I had a dozen better ways of keeping my niece and nephew occupied (using an activity like crafts or hide-and-seek) instead of being “spiteful/immature” and just letting them destroy the house.Casey hasn’t said anything about it, but he is kinda an absentee father to be honest. He spends most of his time at work. When he is home, he kinda just acts like the fun uncle while Mandy does the actual parenting. I’m looking for unbiased perspectives on here.

While her allergy is not deadly, even when taking anti allergies her face would get significantly swollen, have red marks all over it that are visable even with heavy make up and she would constantly sneeze. Lockdown was a blessing in a way that she could wear a face mask that was helping with allergies, she is still trying to wear face masks to help her, but can't always do it inside as people immediately think she is ill and don't really want to have us in their restaurants/cafes.And to the issue.

	"body" : "I (21F) attended my aunt’s wedding a few weeks ago. I was not part of the wedding, just a guest which I was fine with. Before the wedding, everyone was advised to drink lots of water and eat beforehand because it was going to be extremely hot that day.  The wedding started at 5:00pm, and I had absolutely nothing to eat or drink up until then except maybe a granola bar because I was extremely busy that day. So when it was time for the wedding, I was already tired and hungry. About thirty minutes into the wedding, (which was at a church btw), I was feeling uneasy and lightheaded so I excused myself to go to the washroom. As I was walking, I got that feeling like I was about to collapse. The next thing I can remember was coming to and see lots of people surrounding me including the bride and groom. Apparently, when I fainted, I fell onto the photographer who was crouched down near me. Not only that, but he dropped the camera lens down and it broke. Tbh I don’t even remember seeing the photographer but I may have been too dizzy or something to have seen him. The wedding was a bit of a cheaper one, so the photographer was a family friend of the grooms who only had one camera with him. The bride was just in tears that she won’t have any good pictures from her wedding. The photographer insisted that he could drive home and grab a different one, but it would take too long. The bride was indeed mad at me, but I feel it was a bit harsh as it was extremely embarrassing for me already. Fainting never even crossed my mind as something that would happen at all. They did get pictures but they were on cellphones.AITA?",

	"body" : "I (16F) live with my dad.  My mom passed in a bad accident a couple of years ago.  My dad met Josie in a grief group or something like that and they got married last year.  Josie has two kids (8M,6M) and I hate living with them tbh.  8M has like really bad ADHD and is constantly accidentally breaking things, making messes, and has meltdowns over the smallest things. 6M is kinda similar but not quite as bad.  They both get into my room and take things or break them. I babysat them once when our parents were dating and I’d rather jump off a building than ever have to watch them again, I stg. Josie offered to pay me when they were dating but I said no.  Now that we all live together, she’s been trying to make me deal with them more and more, usually while my dad’s not home. My dad thinks I should bond with them more but he said I don’t have to babysit.  Josie keeps trying to pull the “just watch them for an hour while I go to the store” or loading me up with chores since I’m not watching the kids. I have chores that I do already, so it’s not like I’m doing nothing, I just want some time to myself on the weekend. My dad doesn’t see it happen so he thinks I’m exaggerating.I have the smaller bedroom in the house we moved into, but I found out when I was putting stuff away that it has a hatch into like a side attic. Nobody else knows about it. I’ve started keeping stuff I don’t want anyone else to get into in there and it’s big enough that I can spread out a blanket and some pillows and read or work on my laptop in peace. I had the idea to just go in there and avoid Josie when my dad’s not home and it worked. She called for me and came looking for me but couldn’t find me. My dad texted me and asked where I was and I told him in my room and dropped my phone location for him to see. Josie still couldn’t find me, but I slipped out before my dad came home and was laying on my bed with a book when he got there. Josie got big mad asking where I’ve been and I said in my room. My dad showed her the location I sent when she said I was lying and snuck out. Now they’re arguing because Josie insists I wasn’t in the house and my dad thinks she’s lying and taking it out on me because I wouldn’t babysit.I do feel a little bad now because I am making Josie look kinda nuts, but I also don’t want to babysit or spend my entire Saturday doing chores.AITA?Edit, because questions in the comments:-I’m not allowed to have a lock of my door and got in trouble for blocking it to keep the kids out. -Josie flat out lies to my dad when I refuse to do what she wants while he’s not there and until now he believes her and I’ve gotten grounded for being disrespectful to her even though the only thing Indid was say no. -I’ve tried having a conversation with both my dad and Josie together and my dad separately and she denies everything and my dad thinks it’s just because I don’t like the idea of the step-family.  Nobody listens to me.I think what I’m going to do since now he thinks she’s lying and is wondering if she actually has been punishing me for not watching her kids is keep my stuff hidden in the attic and not go stay in there for awhile like some people suggested.  I’m going to try and record Josie but I think I might talk to my coach at school, too, because she’s been noticing that I’m losing weight and gassing out too fast at practice and asked if everything is ok the other day.  Maybe she can talk to my dad about it since the stress is effecting my training or figure out who to get involved that my dad would listen to.Edit2:  Ok I talked to my coach and she had me talk to the guidance counselor, and it turned into a whole big deal.  Another lady came in and asked me a bunch of questions about my home life and I had to go get a physical done.  The doctor says I’m way underweight and stressed, but nothing else seems wrong so I have to sit out of practices for two weeks and track my meals for awhile to make sure I’m eating enough.  People talked to my dad and Josie too, and Josie is mad and thinks I’m lying to people at school to get them in trouble with DHR.  They had a big fight and everyone is still mad. My dad said that for the next two weeks I can spend the weekend with my grandparents (they live a couple of hours away) to make sure I can rest and no chores for me during the week.  He said that Josie isn’t allowed to ask me to do anything and she’s not supposed to come into my room anymore without his permission. He also said he would get a lock for my door this week but it was a privilege and I can’t abuse it or it’s gone.  I have to go see a therapist and some other stuff, too. I haven’t told anyone about my spot, but I did tell my dad that I really was home and mostly in my room I was just trying to avoid Josie that day because she was being unreasonable and I hid whenever I heard her coming.  He said he figured something like that was going on.  He said he’s going to try and work every other Saturday morning for awhile to be around more on the weekends and figure this out.  Josie won’t talk to me at all.",

	"body" : "A month ago my oldest turned sixteen. For his sixteenth birthday, the plan was to let him skip school, get to the DMV when it opens, take the driving test, go on a small road trip, be back around when school gets out and then all go out for a family dinner. On the weekend would be his celebration with his friends. Skipping school for the DMV test was planned in advance, but the road trip was a surprise.A few days before the road trip my wife asked me to take our three year old with me that day. I said I wasn't taking a toddler to the DMV; that place is a cesspit. Also the road trip is for additional driving practice before he's able to drive unsupervised. A toddler distracting him is not a good idea. My wife said she wanted the day to herself and if I wasn't willing to take our toddler, the birthday stuff needs to be moved to the weekend so I can.I said I would take our toddler to work with me the next day, but our oldest's birthday is his day, so he's the priority. She got angry and said she's made a hundred sacrifices for our kids, and saying she isn't a priority (not what I said) is disgusting. It was a big fight. My son's birthday she texted me that I'm an asshole multiple times. At the dinner she was in a bad mood.After everyone ate my dad asked us all to go out to the parking lot. He handed the keys to his car to my son, saying he was getting a new one. He also said he would continue to pay the insurance for a year. My wife asked me if I knew about this, and I didn't. She didn't believe me.My wife has called and texted my dad multiple times asking if he is going to do this for all of our kids, saying he shouldn't have done this without asking us first and telling him if he can't do this for all the kids, he needs to take the car back. Eventually he told her shut up and stop bothering him. My wife told me I need to stop talking to my dad. She said he used offensive language (he texted \"stop bothering me woman\" which she says is sexist) towards her and I need to support her. I said she needs to stop talking to my dad, not me. I'll support her not talking to him.My wife said I am disrespecting her, that I won't listen when she says she needs help and let my family treat her poorly.

He recently got a promotion at work and his friends over there were asking for a treat. I'm South Asian (Bangladeshi) and sometimes when I have leftovers from some of the traditional dishes I cook; I pack it for his lunch. Apparently many of his coworkers liked the smell and look of his food and some even tried it and liked it.So when I asked him if we should just invite them at his place where I would cook some traditional dinner; he got excited and said yes. He gave me a heads up that two of them are vegetarian. For dinner, I cooked white rice, tomato chutney, mashed potatoes, spinach, onion fritters, fried eggplants, chinese vegetables, spicy egg curry, chicken curry, lentils with green mango. For dessert, I made gajar halwa (carrot based pudding). I also served veg strips snack and beverages before dinner as an evening snack.All of them seemed to love my cooking and kept complimenting me throughout the night. They also asked me many questions about the ingredients and what is the best way to eat each of them and I was happy to answer those.After they all left, my boyfriend started ranting \"what was that all about?\" I got very confused and apparently when he assumed I was gonna cook traditional meals, he thought it would be more like what they serve at the weddings (biryani, chicken roast, spicy beef curry, kebab, fried fish, and other type of veggie dishes). He thought what we served was not up to the standards; especially when guests are over. I argued that most of my dishes were vegetarian friendly and these are comfort food which are also quite tasty since they were all seasoned properly and made from scratch. He keeps saying that he should've just taken them to a restaurant and that I'm lucky none of them are Indian or something. Otherwise they'd be able to tell that we just fed them \"grass\". I was very hurt by that comment since I put a very high effort into all of that cooking when I don't even live there.I want some fresh outside perspective. Was I TA?",

	"title" : "AITA for not reimbursing my nanny for books she bought for my daughter?",
	"body" : "My daughter, Ruby, is 12. Recently, she has gotten into the original Star Trek show, as well as the Next Generation. Ruby is also a big reader and has started to collect a few of the old Star Trek books that she finds in used bookstores and thrift stores. These books usually cost anywhere from 50 cents to a couple of dollars.My nanny, Tessa (f22), hangs out with Ruby most days after she gets out of school. Tessa has been our nanny for over a year now and she and Ruby get along great. Tessa is big into to thrifting and will often keep an eye out for the books Ruby wants. This is not typically a problem and Ruby always pays Tessa back for the books using her allowance.The problem occurred when Tessa went on a family vacation out west. Apparently she went thrifting during this trip and found some books for Ruby. She texted Ruby asking her if she wanted the books and Ruby said yes.Well Tessa returned yesterday with a stack of about 35 books and told Ruby they cost $50. Ruby doesn't have this much money and told Tessa. Tessa then asked me if I would cover the cost. I said no as Tessa had never asked me about buying Ruby the books, nor was I aware of the conversation between the two of them. Tessa got upset and I asked Ruby to show me the text which made no mention of price, or even the amount of books she was buying. Tessa only said that she found \"some\" books for Ruby. Ruby is on the autism spectrum and does not read between the lines. You have to be very literal with her.Previously, Tessa has never bought Ruby more than one or two books at a time, so I told her that she should have clarified with Ruby regarding the amount, or double checked with me before purchasing, and that I would not be paying the $50. Tessa said she could not return the books because they came from the thrift store. I stood firm in my decision and reiterated that she should have asked me first.Tessa left and Ruby is very upset. I know Tessa is a student and does not have a ton of money so am I the asshole for not paying Tessa for the books?EDIT: Because some people are asking- I am a single parent to Ruby and while $50 dollars will not make or break the bank, it is definitely an unexpected expense. I provide Tessa with an extra amount of money each month to spend on whatever she wants to do with Ruby (movies, the mall, etc). If she wanted to spend this fund on books for Ruby, that would have been totally fine- but she had already used it up.EDIT 2: I definitely didn't expect this post to blow up overnight, so I'm going to add a bit more context. For those of you who are asking how I can afford a nanny for Ruby and still have $50 be a large unexpected expense- I do not pay for Tessa's services. Because Ruby is on the spectrum, she is entitled to benefits from our state, including care. The agency I work with pays Tessa. I am not involved in that process at all.UPDATE: I appreciate everyone's valuable insights into the situation. I have seen a few comments hinting to me about the fact that I don't support my daughter's reading habit. Please know this is DEFINITELY not the case. We are both big readers and frequent patrons of our local library. I am always supportive of Ruby getting new books.I talked to Tessa and told her that I appreciate her for thinking of Ruby, apologized for the misunderstanding, and have paid her for the books. We had a chat about expectations in the future and I don't think this will happen again. I have also talked to Ruby and we agreed that I would hold onto the books and she would pay me for them as she wishes. It's important to me that Ruby learns how to handle her finances appropriately, and we have decided that she will get two new books every week (she reads very quickly). After reading through your perspectives on the matter, I agree that it is better in the long run to lose the money and salvage the relationship between the three of us, and had not considered all the implications of doing otherwise.

I am currently still recovering from my planned c-section and it is taking a lot longer than I had hoped.  I am not on bedrest, but pretty darn close.  Unless it's to go to the bathroom or changing or feeding my baby, I'm pretty much always sitting or laying down.  I don't like it, but it's what my body needs to heal right now.  Both my husband and I are still on maternity/paternity leave.Obviously, that means that pretty much every other aspect of our lives falls on my husband right now.  He' been doing a great job of taking care of the older kids and making sure everything in our lives is running as smoothly as it can given our circumstances.  He's also great about taking care of the baby and giving me breaks as much as he can.  But I can tell it's starting to wear on him mentally and physically.  Neither of us is sleeping well and I swear he looks like he's lost more weight than I have since the baby came.Due to me being pretty much immobile, I can't really go out of the house to do anything without assistance.  So I wasn't able to plan anything really fun for Father's Day.  I did help the older kids make him cards and ordered him some nice steaks to cook though.  I felt bad because for Mother's Day he bought me a 6-hour pregnancy spa treatment and took the older kids out of the house all day so I could have peace.But on the morning of Father's Day, I was feeling worse than usual as I had to strain myself the day before to pick up something off the floor and I aggravated my incision.  So, I was laid up all day.  Again, this meant my husband had to do literally everything that day.  By the time he got the older kids to bed, I could tell he was irritated and upset.  I told him to try and relax for a bit, but then the baby started fussing and he jumped up off the couch, grabbed a pillow, and screamed into it.I tried to calm him down, but he just kept freaking out about how he's at his wits end and he needs a break and that I couldn't even find a way to give him a single hour of quiet on Father's Day.  I started crying and he just looked at me and walked away to take care of the baby without saying anything.After he took care of the baby he came back to me and apologized, but he said he needs a break and he's going to talk to family about taking the older kids for a week or so and that he's just disappointed that his Father's Day was spent running around doing everything for everyone else.  He didn't even get to cook his steaks, he ate cold pizza for dinner.I asked him what I was supposed to do because it's not like I can move or leave the house and he said I could have looked into a sitter for the kids or made them sit with me and watch a movie for an hour so he could have just a sliver of time for himself.  He said he feels like his needs are at the bottom of the list and he just wanted to feel like he matters for one day.",

I'm not entirely sure if we are officially BF/GF, but Nancy seems to think so.Nancy describes herself as a bit of a \"mean girl.\" I honestly thought she was joking for a while, as she is typically quite nice. However, she has an awful tendency to insult people based primarily on their appearance. These insults can happen anywhere and anytime, and can be targeted at literally anyone. Of course, she never says these things about the person right in front of them.The other day, I invited Nancy to a family friend's event we were having. My mother's friend, Sarah, had just gotten out of the hospital for cancer. Sarah's family and my family are very close; I've known them since I was born and consider them to be extended family.Due to cancer and chemotherapy, Sarah no longer has hair and is very thin. Once Nancy saw her, she started smirking. I literally pleaded with her not to say anything rude, and she agreed but told me that I was ruining her fun.Fast forward, I'm chatting with my mother (F55) and sister (F24). Nancy walks by and says hello. She chats for a bit before starting to make several highly offensive jokes about Sarah and her appearance. I will not repeat anything, but her jokes mainly pertained to baldness and anorexia.My mother and sister looked mortified, and so was I. I literally had my jaw hanging open for a good few seconds. Once I snapped out of it, I firmly told Nancy to stop and that no one found her shitty sense of humor funny except herself. She got upset and said that I was being controlling and misogynistic for trying to silence her.I maintained my position and reaffirmed that her comments were insane. She got even more upset and asked that we leave. I said it would be rude for me to go, as it was still relatively early, and she ended up leaving on her own.

My kids were not close to the man. He was a hardass and the kids found him overly strict (and I agree) and they didn't like being around him. The relationship at best was strained but they confided in me over the years that they hoped their mom would leave them. She loved the guy though and when he died last week she was a mess. Our kids were with me when it happened and she wanted to see them so I brought them over. They comforted their mom and she told them, repeatedly, it was okay to cry, it was okay to miss him, that they were all going to miss him. The kids said nothing. She kept repeating it. I told her I thought the kids got it.When the kids saw their mom again she was halfway through planning the funeral and asked if they would be able to do a reading or something for the funeral. The kids said they wouldn't be able to. She was with them a while and then said, since they weren't crying much, maybe they could take a reading and see how they did on the day. Kids told me about it when I spoke to them and they asked if I could talk to their mom. I told my ex not to force the reading.The funeral day came. I showed up for my kids. They were hanging back with me a lot, and they told me their mom kept watching them, which I witnessed myself. For the funeral I sat behind them since she wouldn't let them sit with me. She told us that all her husband's kids should be seated up front and I didn't have the heart to tell her they weren't his kids on the day of her husband's funeral when she was such a mess. So I bit my tongue and supported my kids. It was after the service when everything went down.The kids came to sit in my car for a while and we were laughing about something. Ex came over and asked how they could be laughing when they had just buried their stepdad and why did they show no grief at all over the loss of the man who was part of their lives for 7 years. She said it was almost like they were glad he was gone. She told them they should have been looking way more somber after he passed. She told them if they really didn't care they clearly needed help because her husband loved them. I stepped in and told her to lay off the kids, they were kids. She told me to stop interfering in how SHE parents our kids. My daughter ended up getting mad at her mom and told her she wasn't sad he was gone, he was an ass and she had always hoped she would leave him. She stormed off and my son followed. Ex was going crazy and I yelled and told her to cut it out and to stop trying to make our kids perform a grieving routine over her husband. I told her they were trying to support her and she should be proud of them for that. She started yelling back at me about what an asshole I am so I walked away.AITA?ETA more details on why my kids had issues with him.He spoke to them like they were soldiers and he was their commanding officer. That was how he spoke to his own kids too. Barking orders at them. Also very strict on how they sat and stood (posture). Was very tough on them regarding what extra curricular activities they wanted to do. He had his own ideas of what kids should do and my son especially wasn't interested in the sport aspect and that was not what my ex's late husband liked to hear. He also didn't believe kids should be helped with homework beyond kindergarten and did not like how the kids would react to seeing me during exchanges. He believed kids should act \"civilized at all times\" and them taking off running and jumping into my arms was something he did not approve of and said it to them (though not in front of me after I told him it was what we do).",

	"body" : "My girlfriend (25F) and I (29M) live in NYC and there's a popular app where you buy leftover restaurant food. Restaurants advertise \"surprise bags\" at a reduced price in order to reduce foodwaste. The customer doesn't know what they're getting until they pick the food up, but the cost at least 3x lower than the normal menu price. (EG if an entree is usually $24, the restaurant is allowed to charge $8 at most for it.) These are hit or miss - sometimes you get exactly what you want at a greatly reduced price, but sometimes you get something that you otherwise wouldn't have picked from the menu.I ordered a surprise bag from a barbecue place that I was picking up on the way home yesterday. I texted my girlfriend asking if she wanted one but she said no, she wasn't in the mood for barbecue. However, there was an indian restaurant right next door that also had surprise bags available on the app, so she ordered one of them. The barbecue was $12 and the indian food was $10.When I get home I unpack the meals to see what we got. I was psyched about my bag. Since I paid $12 I knew the value had to be at least $36, but honestly the platter looked a lot more expensive. This was a hit. (Keep in mind that we live in the west village, which is the most expensive neighborhood in the most expensive city in the US, so $36 for one meal is pretty typical.) There were burnt ends, ribs, pulled pork, baked beans, potato salad, bread, onions, and pickles.My girlfriend, however, was  less lucky. Her surprise bag only had 6 different types of soup, half of them being variations on cauliflower soup. She was disappointed to say the least. She asked if we should share my barbecue and I said no, i'm hungry, I offered to buy you some already and you said no, so I'm going to devour it.She got mad and called me the asshole. I told her if she didn't want soup she should have ordered something specifically instead of using the surprise bag app. I then told her to just order something off a food delivery app. She said she didn't want to spend the money (another bit of context is I make a lot more money than her and pay all of our rent, I know she's running a bit of a lean financial picture right now.) I then tell her that if she doesn't want to pay for delivery, I'll walk to the bodega on our street and can buy her something there. (Another bit of context is that we live on a 4th floor walkup with no elevator and she broke her leg in a car accident a month ago, so it can be tough for her to get around.)

	"title" : "AITA for kicking my 72 year old MIL out of the house at night, because she threw away my things?",
	"body" : "I (36F) live with my husband (41M). I have a decent relationship with my MIL, compared to a lot of the horror stories I hear from friends, she’s quite sweet and warm. She is, however, a little… over-controlling? Overprotective? I’m not sure of the exact word, but she has very strong ideas about things and no sense of boundaries. For example, when she stays at our house she takes over the kitchen completely and insists on cooking all our meals. She cooks wonderfully, but she won’t let me help her at all, and puts everything away in the wrong places - and then insists that her way is more logical.She only really comes for holidays, though, and I do like her a lot. So I don’t mind putting up with these mild annoyances. I’m currently pregnant with our little girl, who will be born in a few months. This is a miracle - I really didn’t think it would happen, especially so late, but we got lucky. When my MIL heard, she was super excited and said she would come over to help us get ready for the baby. She offered to stay for the next 6 months or so to help out, because my husband and I both work long hours and it will be hard to handle the baby on top of this. She is also pretty emotionally invested in this, because she truly sees herself as part of our family. She arrived a few days ago and set herself up, then she started with the cleaning.I like collecting things from garage sales and such. Things like little sculptures and books and baskets, stuff a lot of people would consider utter junk. Our house is definitely overstuffed, but it’s reasonably tidy and doesn’t seem like a hoarder’s house or anything. My MIL, on the other hand, likes everything surgically clean. Yesterday I came home from work to find the house like a war zone, she went through my cabinets and cleared out everything she considered junk, and had apparently made several trips to goodwill before I got home. I was really angry and I asked her why she would ever do this. She said the house has to be tidy for the baby, and that it would be “dangerous” for the baby to be in my cluttered house.Then she took the next huge bag of stuff and tried to walk out the door. I kind of lost it, and I told her she could get out right now. She was shocked that I was serious, and she said she doesn’t have anywhere to go and it’s so late. It was about 9:30. I booked her a hotel room and called a taxi.My husband came home an hour later, and when I told him what happened, he was furious with me. He says I disrespected his mom and was ungrateful for everything she’s trying to do for us. AITA?",

	"body" : "Update :https://reddit.com/u/Justanaunt2/s/VhlPPq6vGyI (F42) live with my husband (M45) and our daughters (F18 & F16). We live in a different city from our families due to work.A few months ago my sister asked me if her daughter Kate (F19) can stay with us since she was starting college in our city. She was scared of her daughter moving away for first time, especially to a big city like ours.I knew Kate from before Covid time and remembered her to be a smart sweet kid. I discussed with my husband and we agreed she can stay with us.Kate moved in around two months back. She was fine, came home on time, let us know her whereabouts, no partying.The issue was with food. She had turned vegan.Normally I cook for my family. I cook just one meal for all. And we are all diary obsessed people. Milk for cereal, butter in pancakes, cheese in everything. Eggs were our staple.Kate needed separate dishes altogether and we needed vegan substitutes for her. Since those are way more expensive, I told my sister she should give money to Kate so she can buy it. She stared telling me how family doesn't take money from family to feed kids. I told her I would feed Kate same as other kids but I won't spent excess money on her. She said thats fine.Since her mom won't buy it, Kate started buying plant based substitutes with her pocket money. For dishes like pancakes, I made food for her using her incrediants.But everytime I made a huge non vegan meal, she expected me to provide equivalent vegan meals. I drew line at that. I can't spend so much time cooking another meal. She said everyone else got to eat it while she was left with few stuff go eat. I told her she is free to cook for herself and she hated that idea.It came to a boiling point last weekend when we had a barbeque dinner with friends. She got upset that her salad was very basic, (it was good only with chicken added) and had nothing else to eat. She complained and I told her she can cook for herself. She got even more upset at that and called her mom crying about how I didn't make any good meals for her and expected her to fend for herself.My sister called me yelling at me how I didn't love her daughter and was intentionally excluding her. My parents are also taking their side.AITA ?",

	"title" : "AITA For refusing to let my husband move his father into our home",
	"body" : "My husband's (40M) mom passed away late last year.  It was very hard on him and his father.  The holidays were rough.  My husband is still struggling and I've been doing my best to be kind, supportive, and understanding.  But he's been less attentive with our 3 kids (14F, 12M, & 9M) and I'm pretty sure he's struggling at work too but he won't admit it.  He started therapy about a month ago and is going once a week.A couple weeks ago he brought up to me that he wants to move his dad (75M) into our house.  He said that his dad is struggling too and that being in the house he shared with his wife the past 50-years isn't doing him any good.  He had an entire plan laid out so it was obvious to me that he's been planning this for a while without talking to me about it.He wants to move his dad into the room that we had just moved our middle child into last summer.  Before that, our 2 youngest were sharing a room so we did some renovations to make an extra bedroom so all our kids could have their own space.  He wants to force our 2 youngest to share a room again so his dad can move in.  He also wants to talk to his dad about putting their house on the market or possibly renting it out, which means FIL would be here long-term.After he laid out his plan, he asked me what I thought and I told him my immediate reaction is \"no.\"  I told him that barely any time has passed since his mom's death and it's too soon to make such drastic changes in everyone's lives.  I told him his dad will get better with time and we all just need to take a step back and not rush into any decisions.He was not happy with my response and kept asking for specific reasons other than \"not enough time has passed.\"  I suggested that we look into different housing options for his dad if he's uncomfortable in his home, which I get.  His dad has enough money saved to afford a good retirement home or smaller condo, which would allow everyone to still have their own space.  He didn't like that idea either because it would mean his dad is still living alone.I'll admit, there are reasons I didn't tell him.  Seeing my husband deal with his grief has been hard, especially since it's effecting his ability to be present with me and the kids.  I really don't want a second grieving man in our house.  I also really don't want to kick our middle child out of the room that we just made specifically for them.  That isn't fair to them.  But I know if I tell my husband this, he's going to think I'm being selfish, and maybe I am.FIL currently lives about 3 hours away so visiting him is difficult.  We also live in a pretty rural area and the nearest town with respectable retirement homes is over an hour away, so even that option isn't ideally close, but it's still closer.  I know it sounds selfish, but I just don't think I could handle 2 grieving men in my home. I can barely handle one right now.",

	"body" : "UPDATEUsing a throwaway,I'm (42) the eldest of 8 siblings, this concerns my youngest sister Elina (23). Me and my husband have 2 kids (16 and 13). Elina's staying with us for 4 months because she started at a new college, and she needs some time to sort out housing. She's been here for a couple of weeks so far, last night she made dinner for everyone (she said she wanted to).The way dinner usually works in my household is I dish up the food, then my kids take it to their rooms to eat. We obviously have family dinner too, but this is just more convenient for all of us as we don't have to spend time setting the table every day, and we can eat at different times if needed (also by different times I don't mean someone eats at 7 pm and someone eats at 3 am, just a small gap).I know this isn't for everyone and that's okay, but this is what works for our family. Elina knows this.So last night she made fried dumplings, orange chicken, fried rice and chocolate cake for dessert. I went into the kitchen to thank her and saw her setting the table. I told Elina she doesn't need to do that and we'll take food from the pot.My 13 yo started saying she was hungry so I went to get food since everything was done, but Elina stopped me and said to wait a few minutes and we'll eat together. Again I told her that's not how it really works here, one of my kids is hungry now, but my 16 yo usually eats a bit later.Elina then said she was going to serve the dumplings first, then chicken and rice and cake after. I repeated to her, again, we can get the main food at once, cake later and if anyone wants seconds we'll come and get it, it's fine, no need to set the table.She looked upset and said she wants to have a 'nice dinner together' and 'involve the kids'. I had enough at this point so I told her I know my kids and family, she doesn't have to dictate what we do on my home. My husband saw what was going on and told Elina thanks, but we know how to serve ourselves.Elina eventually understood but she was acting sulky, and giving me the cold shoulder this morning.AITA?",

	"body" : "My half sister and I share a mom. She's 9 years older than me (17f). Her dad died when she was 5, mom remarried to my dad when she was 8 and got pregnant with me straight away. Until I was 10 I thought she was the best person ever and I wanted us to have a relationship like my friends had with their siblings. But she has rejected me as \"not being her real sister\" from day one. She also rejects my dad as anything other than \"my mother's fuck buddy\" and she has called him that to his face and in front of other people. My dad always lets it slide and mom will tell her we're a family, to which my half sister will say she's family but my dad and I are not.When I was 6 my brother was stillborn when mom was about 6 months pregnant with him. She had grandma come over to watch my half sister and me while she was in the hospital and we were told something happened to our brother. I was really upset because I had been so excited and wanted comfort from my half sister. She told me to grow the fuck up and stay away from her. She also told me it was a shame the same thing didn't happen when mom was expecting me. Grandma was horrified and told her she would regret saying that but my half sister told her she wouldn't regret saying that about someone she didn't love.The breaking point was that Christmas when I was 10. She decided to stay with a different family member for Christmas but did show up to our grandparents for Christmas Day celebrations. I was excited to see her and thought the fact she showed up meant she might like me now. But after I had tried talking to her she turned on me and said she didn't give a fuck about me or my life and did not want me to know anything about hers. She called me pathetic and asked why she would care about someone like me. She told me if she could turn back time she would have begged for mom to have an abortion with me because I was disgusting. It was that point where I think I hit the point where I was like you know what, fine.Over the last 7 years I have seen her maybe 3 times. She avoids being where I will be and she has made it clear to mom that if mom wants to see her, dad and I are not welcome and we are not invited into her life. Except now she's getting married and she invited me and wanted me there because questions were asked. Mom was so happy when my half sister told her she really wanted me there. Mom was so eager to tell me. My half sister even showed up to invite me personally. But I told her I would not go. She explained she needed me and why and I told her I will not make her look better by showing up. I said she wants me dead, I don't want her in my life, it's as simple as that.Mom cried that we're siblings and I told her I lost my only sibling when my brother was stillborn. That he would have been my only sibling, because my half sister sure as shit wasn't a sibling for me. She made it clear many times over she did not want to be.My half sister and mom both feel I'm really in the wrong.AITA?",

We wrote that we loved everyone and that we knew they loved us so if you want to say anything say it to us directly, in private. My husband thought it was funny but he knew my feelings about speeches. We had a small wedding with only loved ones. a weekend long. My husband loves games so the wedding planner did a really great \"task master\" type of games and everyone appreciated it.

	"title" : "AITA for telling my husband if he wants someone to stay home with our baby, he can do it?",
	"body" : "For context, I’m currently 29 weeks pregnant. My husband (29M) and I (30F) met in college, and have been together for 8 years, married for 2. Our relationship has always been solid, and progressive. My husband has never been much of a traditionalist despite growing up in a very stereotypical family (had 2 siblings and a stay at home mom, his dad worked). Up until recently, we’ve agreed on nearly everything (save for small things) in our marriage and how to raise kids. However, 2 days ago, we were talking about baby stuff, and my husband started mentioning that he thought maybe one of us she stay home with the baby for awhile, and not go back to work after our maternity/paternity leave is over. We both work in tech, and make good money and have great benefits. I get 20 weeks of leave after the baby is born, he gets 12. We were trying to decide if we should stagger our leave so someone could be home with the baby until 6 months, the age where most places near us will start daycare. My husband said that he read that it’s better for the baby to have a parent home for the first year. So I asked him (thinking nothing of it) if that’s really something he’d consider, since he might have to quit his job. He asked why he would have to quit, since I should “obviously” be the one to stay home with the baby. I asked him if he was serious and he said yes, the mom should be the one to stay home. I said how are we going to make that work on just his income? For context, I make about 3 times what my husband does. It’s never been an issue and never mattered to me, I just finished my masters earlier than he did (we both have them) and went into a more specialized field. We both make good money, but it’s my job primarily that pays for the lifestyle we have. So I asked him what we were going to do for a year on 1/4 the income with a new baby. He got a little upset and said I “shouldn’t even bring that up” and that he makes good enough money to provide for us and I shouldn’t “question him”. I got mad, and said it wasn’t realistic and it was silly for the person who made more money to quit their job, especially since he’s the one who thinks someone should be with the baby extra time (I was fine with sending baby to daycare starting at 6 months). The fight blew up from there, me saying he’s being sexist and not considering my feelings at all. I refused to back down  and he ended up taking off after I said he should be the stay at home parent if he wants one so bad, and him saying he didn’t deserve to be emasculated just for suggesting I should stay home like a “good mom”. I talked to some of my family and his family about it and the answers are kind of split, so AITA for bringing up the pay disparity and telling him that unless he’s the one to stay home, baby is going to daycare?Update: I was reading through a ton of comments last night and got really nervous, wondering if maybe I was wrong about my husband being progressive- a lot of people were asking why we didn’t talk about all this before we got pregnant and the thing is, we did! We had agreed on daycare (for the people suggesting a nanny, I’ve begun looking into it but they are a really difficult to find sometimes) because we both wanted to keep our jobs that we love.My husband has been acting weird and quiet since we fought but this morning I finally sat him down and was basically like “what is going on, this doesn’t seem like you”. Some of the comments here got me thinking about what his family might be pressuring him to do, and so I asked about that and a ton of stuff came out.He said he brought up the staggered leave to some people in his family at dinner a couple weeks ago (I wasn’t there) and a few of them thought someone should stay home longer, and his brother laughed and made some jokes about my husband being a housewife/ stay at home mom. His brother (35, divorced!) considers himself to be a “man’s man” and has a lot of sexist views, so he’s made jokes before about me being the “breadwinner”. So after hearing this my husband snapped a bit because some of his coworkers and his older brother have laid into him a bit about the fact that I make more money and have a better job title, calling him a “trophy husband” and other dumb stuff like that, and it made my husband feel insecure so he lashed out a bit at me and that’s why we fought. He’s admitted that he felt really bad about it which is why he’s kind of been avoiding me.We have now agreed to looking into a counselor and more into a nanny service, and he has admitted that he doesn’t mind the idea of taking a few unpaid months to stay home, he’s just really worried about his brother and friends jokes.

We became good friends and socialised together and still do.Ally then met her partner ‘Matt’ who she is still with years later.He does not share her interests. He is an avid football supporter (UK) and very anti the rival football team.  Even when he doesn’t go to watch matches live, he watches at the pub with male friends.  He plays sport with his friends. She’s a football widow. She likes going to the theatre and to dinner.

He has a professional job but isn’t very ‘refined’ unlike her and I found him a bit difficult to connect to.At the time she was hurt but got over it and generally just engineered it so I never really saw him.

My wife (36f), is a skeptic of American medicine and has been upset with how much I use my phone.So to start, we have an 18 month old baby that we take care of, but I wake up groggy and grumpy every day and have been for decades. So when I finally had the chance to take a sleep study, I jumped on it.Now, I got the results back 2 days ago, and it came back positive. Obstructive sleep apnea. I wasn't surprised. What did surprise me was the price of a machine, nearly $900. So I booked an appointment to get the machine.My wife was livid. She told me that it's too much to pay, that I have student loans to pay off, that she's been saving all this money just for me to waste on myself, when she hasn't gotten a good night's sleep in over a year and a half.She says that since I sleep heavily, I might sleep better than she does. So last night, she was saying all I need to do is \"Don't be in your phone all the time and you'll sleep better.\" I was tired of her always thinking she's smarter than doctors so I abruptly said \"F*ck you.\" and stormed out of the room.Now it's today. I cancelled the appointment, I'm not expecting anything to get better, she is still not speaking to me, and I'm wondering if I'm wrong here. AITA?Edit 1: to clarify, we have more than a year's income in savings, so at this point we are hoarding money. Also, she told me it was \"just doctors trying to make money\". Also, she told me to my face \"you wouldn't use it anyway\". Lastly, I do use my phone at night, but only to combat existing insomnia. So if I get a good night's rest, I am less likely to overuse coffee to stay alert during the day, breaking the cycle of coffee -> bad night's sleep -> coffee.Edit 2: I'm only 130lbs, so it's clearly not a weight/diabetic issue. We have two beds, one in the master bedroom and one in the basement across the house, so it wouldn't be a noise issue to get one. And I understand I need to be nicer about this. It's not the first time I've sought medical help (she doesn't really believe in psychology or therapy) and she pushes back on every decision, so I admit I snapped and need to work on that. My results were 5.1 stoppages per hour on average, and lowest blood oxygen level was 89% average.Edit 3: I've gone ahead and ordered a machine.",

I make pretty good money and my job is challenging but fun.Some of my friends didn't bother with college and some who did go chose less lucrative fields.I'm not rich or anything.  I'm not buying a Porsche any time soon.  I just have a good salary and very few bills since I still live at home.I got a very nice hiring bonus when I was recruited and I took my friends out for, what I made clear, was a one time celebration.Every once in a while I get together with my friends and go to a restaurant.  We usually end up splitting the bill.  I don't drink a lot so I might have a beer with my meal but that's it.  I know they don't al have disposable income like I do so I usually also cover the tip. They tend to go overboard.  Like one girl orders five or six drinks over the course of the meal.  And she will order appetizers \"for the table\".  I never eat the appetizers because they are almost always deep fried and I tend to avoid that stuff.  It is also common for one of us to leave and just cash app or leave money for the bill.Last Saturday we went out to a nice Mexican place.  The food was excellent and my margarita was delicious. That girl brought her girlfriend and a couple of the guys brought their girlfriends.I mentioned that I had to have an early night. After we finished eating I hung around until everyone started ordering more drinks and desserts and stuff.  And I'm not joking here one girl ordered a to go meal for her roommate.I excused myself and went to the bathroom.  Afterwards I paid my bill at the front of the house and bailed.I started getting texts about 45 minutes later.  The bill came and they wanted to split it.  I told them I already paid and had to leave. My bill was $55 including tip.  The three guys and the girl were going to be splitting the remaining $640. They wanted to split their guests bill as well.  The other guy who didn't invite someone was saying it wasn't fair for him to split the bill when I didn't.  I said that I had paid my food bill and I wasn't going to give more.They ended up each paying their own bill and one guy ended up paying for his, his date's, and her roommate's food.  He is especially salty about the situation.The other single guy also ended up just paying for his own stuff and he is also in their bad books.I feel bad for leaving without saying goodbye but if I had stuck around I would be subsidizing food for strangers.EditI'm sorry if I offended anyone with the term Irish exit.  I didn't know it was an insult.",

	"title" : "AITA if I tell my friend her BF is planning to propose?",
	"body" : "My (27f) best friend has been dating her boyfriend (26m) for over 5 years. Awhile back he reached out to me to help figure out ring size and the set up so he could make this the most magical day for her. Having known my friend for over 20+ years, I know exactly how she wants her proposal to go and who she wants to be there, so I relayed all this information to him months ago via texts and over the phone. I even took the time to covertly find and confirm which ring she would love the most.A little background: My friend is INCREDIBLY family and friend oriented, and in the past expressed to me on multiple occasions (especially during holiday season) that in the 5 years they’ve been together, he hasn’t really made much of an effort to indoctrinate himself into her family or friendships the way she has for his.  While I do generally like him, i have always felt that he is incredibly self-serving and self-focused.Recently, through a mutual friend, I found out he started a group text between his (emphasis on HIS) friends and his family to set up the time and date of the proposal. He has not only excluded myself (and according to the screenshots I’ve seen, he is doing everything VERBATIM I suggested he do) but he has completely excluded her family and other close friends from the event. He is planning on only having his “boys” and family present for the occasion, and knowing my friend this would ultimately break her heart not being able to share this moment with her loved ones.I got a heated and called him. At first he was dodging my questions, then just out right said “this is my proposal and I’ve spent enough time and money to choose how I do it, just be happy for your friend. It’s not like you’re not coming to the wedding.” This INFURIATED me, and to make matters worse, I ran into her mom and dad at the grocery store and subtly asked if they knew of any possibility she was getting engaged. They were unaware, and I know for a fact my friend has told him that he needs to ask her parents for their blessing (she’s somewhat traditional).My friend wears her heart on her sleeve, and I can predict how this event will go down when she sees all of his close friends and family and none of hers. Considering her previous sentiments about his lack of interest in her family/life, she will 100% see this as being hurtful and selfish and I know she’ll cry. To make matters worse, the location of the proposal is a whopping 30 minutes from her parents home.I don’t want to get involved in a fight or reveal the surprise, but on the other hand I feel I owe it to my life long friend to help her avoid being hurt and disappointed, maybe even helping her rethink what her future would look like with someone who just doesn’t really appreciate what she values in life. So, AITA if I tell my friend her boyfriend is going to propose?EDIT: I did not tell her parents, I ~covertly~ inquired if he had spoken to them yet about proposing since it’s been 5 years, like in a joking way.Edit 2: the proposal is scheduled for this weekend, I will give you guys an update on how it goes. After so many responses, I have decided not to say anything and to let things play out. I gave him an opportunity by expressing the need to invite her parents and friends like she’s always wanted, and he chose not to - that’s on him, not me!",

	"body" : "My daughter (Ava 14) is a good kid in general. She gets good grades and is pretty quiet at school sticking to her friend group and not causing issue. I was surprised getting a call today that I needed to pick her up since she got in trouble at school.Basically what happened was the class clown (Mia) was messing around in class was dancing/singing during class for no reason. My daughter had enough and told her to shut the fuck up, no one likes her and she is the reason no one enjoys school. A student recorded the whole thing. Mia ended up crying and principal office they were both sent.The principal wanted my daughter to give an apology to her. I told them no and that we are leaving. This started the mom telling me her daughter needs an apology. I told her that her kid is a brat and she should learn how to behave in class. That if she wasnt annoying as all hell my daughter wouldn’t have snapped after 5 months.She called me a jerk and my daughter is iffy if she should apologize so I am making this.Edit to clear stuff upThis was asked, the teacher was trying to get her back to her seat, this was in a middle of lesson. She was trying and Mia was ignoring her and kept goingAlso since some people are confused, this wasn’t a one time thing, according to my daughter she had 5 months of dealing with Mia and her behavior.Another question I’ve seen, does she have ADHD. No idea, not my kid. If she does it make explain some things but doesn’t excuse it.Update 1: so some stuff has happened since it posted this, it got out what my daughter did to the other parents and they have sent me email receipts of how many times they tried to get the school to do something about Mia. Most of the parents are pissed Ava had to go to the principals.The principal has sent an email about conduct in the classroom and a new policy that if kids disrupt a class they will be taking action. Don’t know what that means yet.",

The issue is they always want to split the check. I have had the conversation so many times that I want to pay for what I ordered. It results in an argument where I have to bend or everyone is mad at me.I also make a lot more then my friends so it always result in them basically calling me cheap. They don’t get I want to pay for my meal and that is it.Anyways we went out to eat yesterday and they all ordered things that were around 30 dollars, I got the house salad and my total was around 12. They told the server to split the bill and I didn’t want to fight about it again.I asked the server to add on to the bill an entree and dessert for me to take home. This resulted in my bill going up into the 30s.So they asks me what I was doing, I told them I am getting more food, they got upset they I increased the price they needed to pay. This resulted in another argument and they think I am a jerk.Edit: Reddit I’ve done everything you have suggested, I have had the server take mine out and I pay for it, I have spoken to them.

	"body" : "My husband and I are expecting our first child. We moved to be closer to his family. I'm no contact with mine.My mother in law has been referring to the baby as \"her\" baby this entire time. She will say things like \"I can't wait for my baby to be born.\" \"My baby is going to be so loved.\" This rubs me the wrong way for reasons I cannot explain, but my husband tells me to ignore her.My MIL wanted to throw me a baby shower and invite her friends. She said they made an agreement a long time ago that they would celebrate each other's kids' weddings and births. My husband and I eloped and declined a reception for her friends since we don't know them. My MIL told me that I owed it to her to let her throw the baby shower since I hurt her friends' feelings by not having wedding reception. I asked if I could invite my friends, and she said no, that this was for her friends, and that if my friends wanted to throw me a shower they could. I reluctantly agreed.My husband and I spent hours on our registry, and my MIL asked for it so she could share with her friends. She said she forwarded the registry on. She asked me what design I wanted on my cake and cookies. I told her flowers because I am decorating the nursery in a garden theme.At the shower they provided me with a \"mother to be\" sash and my MIL a \"granny to be\" sash to wear. I noticed that the theme of the shower was circus animals. The cake had an elephant and balloons on it, and the cookies were animals. At first I thought that maybe the floral theme was just too difficult, so I rolled with it until it was time to open presents.Every present was some sort of circus animal. Onesies, blankets, toys - nothing on my registry. I was a little confused and even went so far to check my registry to make sure I hadn't goofed up and changed everything. I thanked everyone for their gifts and tried to sound as gracious as possible, but I was so confused.My husband, who is a little less tactful than I am, showed up at the end of the shower and noticed the theme right away. He goes \"what's up with all the circus animals?\" He looks at the presents and says, \"This isn't what we asked for.\" Then he looked at his mom and goes \"MOM. What did you do?\"She smiled and said, \"I didn't like the theme you chose for my baby. I'm going to decorate my baby's nursery at my house with circus animals, so I created a registry for myself.\" My husband said, \"YOU DID WHAT?\" She says, \"My baby is going to need a room at my house so I threw a shower for myself.\"I lost my composure and told her that she would not see MY baby and to stop calling the baby hers, and my husband told his mom that she's delusional if she thinks we're going to allow this. She started crying and said we are just withholding her baby from her.We've been getting texts from his family since the shower, calling us selfish and ungrateful and saying we ruined her joy of being a grandma.Are we the AH?",

	"title" : "AITA for refusing to miss some of my kids events when my ex-wife's husband asked?",
	"body" : "I share two kids Indie (10m) and Colbie (8f) with my ex-wife Thora. We have remained very close and she and I don't follow a strict parenting plan. We do our best to have the kids see us both as much as possible. We celebrate every birthday, every Christmas together, and we show up to support our kids together as much as we can make work with our jobs. Our families are also still very tight. The kids love it. Sometimes it will be my parenting time but they want Thora and so they spend that day with her, or vice versa. Works so well for the kids.Thora married Michael in November 2021. He and I got along in the beginning. He clearly loved Thora and was great with the kids, which is what Thora and I cared most about. But then this past summer some things changed with Michael. An example is Indie was singing and playing an instrument at this little talent show his summer camp set up. Thora and I both went, so did Michael, who took the day off work. Michael did not look happy to see me and once Thora was not within earshot or sightline, he was visibly tense and I swear he groaned at some point near me. Then Thora had to go out of state to see a friend of hers who was very sick. The kids chose to stay with me and I don't believe Michael was happy about that. I tried to ask him about it but he swore things were fine.In November Indie and Colbie had a busy month with different stand out things within extra curricular's and school. I was lucky enough to attend 9/10 of them with Thora attending 8/10. Michael got to attend 3/10. All three were ones I could attend and it felt very much like he didn't want me there.Late last month when Michael and I were the ones attending a school function for the kids that he asked me to show up to less of the kids events and let him and Thora do some of that stuff with the kids as a family. I told him they already do. He said not when I'm around. That I am getting in the way of him being a parental figure for the kids. I told him he was a parental figure and the kids love him. He said they will never consider us equal until they see him instead of me at some of these events. He said it's important for the more \"stable family unit of four\". I told him I was not willing to miss the kids events. He did not take it well and accused me of interfering and alienating their chances of a family unit. He texted me after the event with things he wanted me to miss (including Indie's Elementary school graduation in May). I told him it was not happening. He told me Thora wanted this too.Thora knew nothing of this and told me the kids would be so upset if we did what Michael wanted, which I knew also. She was angry at Michael. Michael is angry at me still. He called me an asshole. I don't want to believe I'm an asshole but I know this is not the norm for every divorced parents situation and it makes me ask if I am TA for not letting them have some of those events just them.AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for telling my friend it’s her fault for getting married and having kids late because the world won’t wait on her now.",
	"body" : "I (39F) have a 6 person girl group since college (37-39F) and that includes Mary (38F). We’ve been close throughout the years and have been at milestone events for each other. Mary just had a baby and is completely fitting the crazy new mother stereotype.In college, Mary has always been someone who had to make it known that she was unique/different from the rest of us which wasn’t as draining then as it has become now. For starters, all other women in our circle, got married between the ages of 22-27 and we all have multiple kids. So the 5 of us were able to experience those milestones alongside one another and got closer as we shared similar lifestyles.Mary was very adamant on not settling until her 30s because she wanted to travel and have different experiences which we all supported. Regardless, she would continue to make comments about how she’s so lucky unlike us because we’re “tied down with husbands and babies”. I think this is where she grew resentment towards us because we were in different places in life and she was upset we couldn’t have our group be similar to how it was in college.Then into our mid 30s it became a whole saga of she’s getting older and can’t find a husband because all the “good men” are married or divorced with kids. When she finally got married, many could not attend because it was a destination event and child-free during Covid. This caused a fight because she said how she was there for us during our weddings but we couldn’t put aside a week for her. We had all told her how we wished we could, but it simply was not financially feasible and didn’t logistically work with our kids. But she just refused to hear us out and was simply so inconsiderate about our lives and families, saying we were horrible friends.Now, Mary just gave birth to her first child and I was very excited for her. The only issue is that she moved from our state to a very remote place that’s only accessible by a 6hr car ride. Her baby is 6mo old and none of us have been able to go up to visit her. I think she’s been having a wrong idea of what a “village” is and has essentially demanded in our groupchat that we come up for the holidays and help her out because she’s having a hard time adjusting to mom life. But this would entail we all take a week off, arrange childcare, figure out transportation, and book hotels during the holidays. It’s gotten to the point where she’s posting cryptic messages on Facebook bashing “fake friends” who won’t be there for her. As much as I wish I could, I cannot physically support her in the way she needs me to do in this stage of life. It would have been completely different if she still lived in our city and this was earlier in life when we had less commitments/priorities. So I told her this and that if she was hoping for this big village and constant support, she should have thought about that when planning out her life because we can’t all just pause our lives for her.

	"body" : "To make a long story short, I lost my husband only a month ago. It's hard, I'm still grieving and I miss him everyday. I have to take medication for depression and anxiety to help me get through the day.Last week, my sisters dog was put down due to some health issues and she was very upset, which is understandable. She called me as soon as it happened and said I was the only sibling who would understand her pain.I didn't mind, honestly I just wanted to comfort her since her dog meant the world to her. She held a wake for him and our whole family attended. It was a nice service.But now, she's comparing our losses. Telling me she knows exactly what I'm going through. That she can relate to the pain of losing someone so close to you. She calls me asking if we should visit graves together. It was fine the first time but it's constant. She goes 3 times a day. It's already difficult to go once a week for me and she knows this. I feel like she's not even considering my own grief process.Anyway, I told her that grieving her dog is not the same as grieving my husband. She's upset and refusing to talk to me now. I get it, it was uncalled for really. But my loss is new to me too and I guess I just got frustrated with how different we're dealing with our losses. Idk I feel like she should understand where I'm coming from too.A dog is not the same as a husband. A dog can't love you back like a husband can. A dog can't read to your children like a husband can. A dog can't make soup when you're ill like  a husband can.It's really hard for me right now to discern when I'm being condescending or not. Idk if it's a side effect of my medication, or if the empathetic part of my brain has shut down. But I really am getting tired of her comparing our pain when she lost her dog and I lost my world. At the very least, she still has her husband.I have two young children at home, processing a loss unimaginable to most kids their age. And she's trying to whisk me away to graveyards to visit her dog.Aita?Update: There seems to be mixed opinions on this thread, which is fine. I guess people have different views on what asshole-ish behaviour is.First of all, I appreciate all of your condolences. There are just simply too many to like and respond to (although I think I got to upvote most of them) that I have decided to add it to an update.This garnered far more attention than I expected to, in all honesty, I thought the first few comments were enough. Some of these comments did cheer me up. There was a whole etymology lesson in here at some point Secondly, I know where I went wrong. It's the whole reason for the post, after all, and I can see where my sister went wrong. I will have an honest conversation with her at some point, and we have spoken since the incident. But it was mostly to do with our mother's birthday. I think we're both just in a place where the wounds are too fresh. It doesn't help that as a big sister, I am normally always her rock, but this time, I was more like a deflated balloon dealing with so many other things on my mind. It's been a rollercoaster this past month, and I think the graveyard visits were possibly more triggering than I realised at the time. I did want to be there for her initially, but it was just too much.It was never my intention to minimise anyone's pain of losing a pet, I went through a moment of selfishness where I thought she could not possibly understand my pain. I know losing a pet is a painful process for many people (I'm not really a pet person, so I guess that's where my lack of understanding comes from). But at the time, I did not think of it as insulting because I did not mean to imply she shouldn't feel grief over a pet. I had meant it as she couldn't understand the continuous effects of losing your partner and co-parent. Something new always pops up that he would normally deal with, a plumbing issue, having to fix some shelves, the kids wanting to have a barbecue. I lack in so many things he could easily sort out, and it makes me feel like a horrible parent and wife, like I was burdening him with so much.I plan to explain all of this to her. I think she'll understand. We've been through worse, and we've made it out fine. I have faith that our relationship will only become stronger from this. I love her, and as much as I am her rock, she's mine. But in this one particular instance, perhaps it's safer for our relationship that we keep a distance. We're just too different when we grieve. It's not compatible. But that doesn't mean I don't care about what she's going through.",

They went to college together and they are good friends.  I thought that she was incredibly beautiful when I saw her but I was trying my best not to be the creepy older brother hitting on his little sister's friends. We talked a little bit and I asked her about her work since graduating. She gave me a weird look but told me about working in the medical field. I thought it was very interesting work from the sounds of it. After they left my dad made fun of me for not asking her out.My sister called me last January out of the blue and said I was probably good to contact her friend and ask her out. She said she even put in a good word for me. And that I was going to need it.So I started talking to Claire and we went out for lunch. She is very beautiful like I said. She is also very smart and driven. She has a future all planned out. I jokingly said I was interested in being part of that future. She said my sister had already half convinced her I was a good idea.We had a few more dates and then we made it official. It's been over a year since our first date and my family loves her and my friends all think I fluked into the greatest relationship ever.Anyways the party. Whenever I talk about Claire I mention her work. She studied child psychology and is working on her Master's. See, smart. I love bragging all about how she is making the world a better place.At the party my friend started joking around about her being able to make more money as a model or something. I told my friend he was being an ass talking about her looks and he should drop it. He did not.He even started making beauty and the beast comments. He was rude but never vulgar. Just rude.He wouldn't. Drop it. He may have been a little jealous and drunk. She finally went on her phone and showed him some pictures of herself in the uniform from the job she does for fun.  She is a cheerleader for a sports team. She then told him how little the job pays. She spent time explaining to him that she competed in cheer in college and it was a hard sport and that she only auditioned for the professional squad because they do a lot of work with children's charities. She said that she was tired of people like him thinking all she had to offer was her looks.  He got embarrassed and left.He called me up later and said I was an asshole for not telling him I'm dating a cheerleader. I said I'm not. I'm dating Claire, a woman who is in her way to being a child psychologist. He said that I should have told him so he wouldn't have been such an sss about her looks.I don't think it's my place to tell people. She doesn't tell everyone.So he's pissed at me for not telling him. He's upset with her for telling him so publicly. I think he was behaving like an ass and should have dropped it when I said so.",

	"body" : "Howdy guys, recently my friend group has been divided on an issue. I have a group of six friends and their significant others from highschool. All of us are in our mid 20s. The only person in our friend group is Jessica, who has two young children and is a single mom.I’m the only person in my friend group that can host, as my husband and I own a decent sized house and don’t have anything stopping us from hosting I guess. One doesn’t want to host, two live with their parents and can’t, another has roommates that won’t let them, etc. we all live in a rural area so there isn’t really anywhere to go for more than a quick dinner, so someone hosting is the only way we can all hang out really. When I host it’s always later in the day; around 7 pm ish. That’s when most of us are off work. I also have a no children rule for my house, since my dog is afraid of children and I honestly don’t like kids anyways. (My nephew yanked my dogs tail several times so now my dog growls at kids).I had a gathering last weekend, a dinner time bbq. Everyone was invited; same rules as norm. Jessica asked if she could bring her kids, because she can’t afford a babysitter and since both of their dads aren’t involved at all. I said no, because of my dogs and also because I don’t want her baby and toddler at my house. The last time she brought them she kept trying to push them off on other people who didn’t want to hold them so she could relax. Also her toddler puked on my 5k white couch, which I had to replace. No she didn’t pay for it.Jessica blew up on me in the group chat, and said that I always exclude her. I told her I’m not excluding her, I’m excluding kids. All kids. She’s welcome to come if she finds someone to watch her kids. I also told her she’s welcome to host. She kind of went on about how none of that is possible and now she isn’t talking to anyone.

I’m going to tell her she’s no longer welcome at my home and ask her to pay for my couch. If she doesn’t then we can go to court about it.Another edit: you guys are really mad I like nice white couches. But I’ll give further info.I considered having the couch reupholstered but the cost to have it shipped out, fixed, and shipped back cost over 5k so it was cheaper and easier to buy a new one.Yes I have a white couch and a dog. My dog knows not to go near the couch. I’ve had the couch for two years without incident, it was fine till jessicas kids showed up.I didn’t invite Jessica and her kids. I said no kids are allowed, and she showed up with her kids while I was in the bathroom and set her kids down on the couch. Her kid then puked all over it.",

They seem like very fine people but they are just not for me.The deal was that I wouldn't have to walk it or clean up after it and that they would take care of it.It went fine for about a year and a half.   But once the damn thing was out of its puppy phase they lost most interest.So for about two years now I have been walking it because it needs exercise.  I have to buy it food because my wife forgets.  I have to walk around the back yard before I mow to make sure I'm not going to run over it's turds.I'm done.  I came home yesterday and it had chewed up a pair of my shoes.I waited until dinner and then I laid down the law.   Thay poor thing is going stir crazy.   It is used to getting their attention and stuff all the time because of COVID.  Now that they can do other stuff they are ignoring it.  It isn't fair to the dog and it isn't fair to me.I said that if they didn't have time to walk it they could play with it in the back yard.  But that if I found any turds back there that I was hiring a service to keep the yard clean but the money was coming out of their allowances or the house budget.  I said I wasn't buying any more food.  If there was no food and the dog wasn't fed I would be hiring someone to watch the dog and once again they would be paying for it.They got upset with me because the dog likes me and it's obviously my dog.  Of course the thing likes me, I take care of it, which I don't want to do.So I brought out our agreement which I made them all sign.  Not my responsibility.  I said they had three choices.  Take care of the dog, rehome the dog, or pay someone else to take care of the dog.They all think I'm being too harsh but I don't think so. I didn't want it on the first place. I've already checked with a friend of mine. She likes dogs and has agreed to take it if my family cannot follow through.My wife says that I'm being an asshole with this ultimatum.

	"body" : "UPDATE:I officially submitted the paperwork to John to get payment for the debt. However I decided that would forgive 1/4th of the debt.  So instead of claiming $37K, I am claiming $27,750.00.  I told my siblings that I would forgive a fourth - and if keeping the house for Sara is important to them then they each need to come up with the same.  So far they are saying they will not contribute.John and I spoke with the lawyer and we were wrong about how any cash from the sale of the house would be dispersed.  First - any liquid assets have to be used to cover debts.  Then if assets need to be liquidated, then whoever was supposed to get that asset gets whatever proceeds are left after paying debts. So no matter what my siblings do - Sara will get the rest of the money if the house is sold.The lawyer also pointed out the same thing many people here did - that giving Sara the money could affect her benefits.  Instead he suggested she turn down the inheritance in favor of placing the money into a special needs trust for her son. Sara will be talking to the lawyer on her options and exactly what that means.Sara is attempting to get a loan using the house as collateral.  Not all the paperwork is in order yet (exactly how much will be left in the estate after all debts are paid) - and we are probably looking at needing to get a professional appraisal of the home first.  One person at the bank talked to her and said that with her credit score and income she doubts she would be approved - but that she would process the application once Sara got all the data.ORIGINAL POST:My mother died about 2 months ago. She didn’t leave behind much other than a paid for house (worth about $180K) and a little money in the bank. Mom announced a couple of years ago that she intended to leave her house to my sister Sara who takes care of her severely disabled son full-time.  Mom said that she wanted to make sure they had a roof over their heads and the rest of her kids could make it on their own.  Sara does struggle a lot and has said many times that she wouldn’t have been able to make it without Mom.When Mom died she had some bills outstanding, but her biggest debt was that she owed me $37K. I had loaned her the money so that she could fix her plumbing and septic system, as well as making the house more handicapped friendly for Sara and Jeremy. Mom had been paying me back every month. I have paperwork proving the money is owed.Here is the problem. If I file a claim against her estate like any other creditor would do, my brother John (Mom’s executor) will have no choice but to pay it. But to do so – he will have to sell the house since there isn’t money in the estate to pay it any other way. Which means that Sara and Jeremy will have to find a different place to live.  I know Mom wanted Sara to have the house. There is also the issue that Mom’s will said Sara got the house, but any money in the estate would be split evenly between the other 4 of us. So technically we think that means Sara wouldn’t actually get anything (John is talking to a lawyer to make sure he is reading that right). Sara is also concerned that if she did get a large amount of money (John and I have both said we would give her whatever we got from the house if it does get sold) – that it could interfere with the help she gets from the government.John and Sara are both pushing me to not file a claim against the estate. But if I don’t – then the loan basically goes away. Sara has said that she will pay it back to me and would even sign a new loan. The trouble is that I don’t believe her. She has borrowed money before and never paid it back – not because she doesn’t want to, but because she can’t afford to. She struggled with money living with Mom – so it is going to be even worse for her without Mom paying bills in the house as well. If I don’t file a claim – I will be out $37K – and that is far more than I want to hand over as a gift – even to my sister.I’ve told John and Sara that I am officially filing a claim on Monday morning. They are both calling me a greedy asshole and telling me that I am ignoring what Mom wanted. I think it's unreasonable to expect me to just forget $37K.  AITA?",

Things were going fine until this argument, also she doesn't work but my parents send her some money for textbooks and groceries although she barely ever has contributed to the household since she moved in with us. We also live in a different state from our parents and family so I'm basically throwing her in the streets by kicking her out which would make me a big asshole.So, my son comes back from school at around 3pm/3:30. My husband works until 6 and I work until 5 although sometimes I have to stay an hour or two extra (this is not normal, maybe three or four times per month when we're behind in a project). We had a babysitter that would wait until he's back (he comes back home via the school bus) and would stay with him until me or my husband come back from work. However she recently discovered she's sick and told us that she can't continue working as she has to go though treatment, we thanked her for telling us and wished she would get better soon.I asked my sister to babysit our son until we can get a new babysitter giving that she doesn't have classes at that time. She told me she never agreed to babysit when she moved in here and that I should've told her beforehand so she could find somewhere else to live. I told her that I knew this wasn't out agreement but this was something exceptional since our babysitter has medical issues, it's not neither of our fault and she would prefer a 100 times to not be in this situation. She still told me she can't babysit because sometimes she has to go to the library or to study with friends and babysitting would limit her hours of studying. I got angry, maybe too angry, so I told her that we never ask anything from her, we helped her because we wanted to be kind with her, and yet she can't even compromise to stay a few hours home just until we find a new babysitter. I ended up telling her she has a week to leave because we will not be providing food or a roof to a bitch like her. One of my son's friend's mom is taking care of my son now, they go back to her home together and I pick him up later.My sister tried to apologize but I told her I don't want to live with her because she showed me her true colors. She also have told our family and a lot of them are giving me shit for leaving my sister homeless.

The only time we go in to her house is to use the bathroom or shower (we have electricity in the camper but no running water). The rest of the time we are across the street building and our kids (14m, 12f, 8m) are with us helping. We pay SIL $180 a week to park our camper there, which is campground prices.Late afternoon yesterday my SIL asked us to all come inside to talk and she pulls up her chore list, with my kids names added to it. Things like laundry, dishes, cleaning the living room, sweeping, mopping, cleaning table + countertops, garbage, returnables, even helping cook meals (we do not eat with them), etc. She said \"Does this work for you? I won't let anyone clean the bathroom because I'm the only one who does it properly.\" I immediately said no. My kids don't even go in her house unless they are showering or shitting so if anything, I'd make them clean the bathroom, not the rest of the house that they don't use. I'm not going to be making them do chores to that extent for simply using the bathroom, after they've been helping us all day with building our home. My SIL, who works all the time, says \"the kids are in here much more than that because all my snacks are gone and I always come home to a trashed house and I didn't before you guys started staying here\". She's clearly not putting two and two together with the fact that her own daughter (12) has had consistent friends over for the past 2 weeks since school let out and her husband (46m) does nothing to parent. Which I brought to her attention. My kids don't eat her food at all either. I've made a point to preach to my kids about minimizing our foot print here for this specific reason (her trying to blame my kids for her trashed house).My husband is saying that maybe I should just allow her to add the kids to one or two chores a week to keep his sister at bay but I've refused. We pay to be here and we do not go indoors at all unless it's for the bathroom, as I've stated. My kids are not going to be scrubbing her house top to bottom for using a restroom and I have since told my husband we need to create an outhouse system (on our property) so we don't have to go in there at all.

Me and my two brothers (one is 22, two of us are 21) have been on the other side of US for the majority of 2023 and didn't think we were going to be there for the party, but plans shifted and we ended up arriving home last Wednesday.Now I'm honestly not sure if I was invited so much as we simply happened to live where the event was being hosted, because it was held in my parents' house. My sister didn't outright say she didn't want us there, but we didn't see much of her in the lead up. We didn't really know any of the people at the party, so we're going around introducing ourselves to people, mingling, doing the party thing. At some point, someone mentions the family photos on the well and how they were surprised to see a ton of us on the wall when they didn't even know my sister had siblings.This sent me down a whole rabbit hole of confusion. This person elaborated and said she was surprised to see this type of photo on the wall because apparently my sister has told all of her friends that my parents were extreme workaholics. We have a really nice house so they weren't surprised by that, just that it felt properly homey and lived in. Once again, I was thrown for a loop.Growing up, our home was THE house. We had friends over constantly who were basically like extra siblings. My parents worked the normal amount, and they were home with us as much as possible. We got chauffeured around to sports practices, my parents took the time to get to know all of our friends well, etc. I would even go so far as to say they were more involved in our lives than average. It was my sister who really separated herself from everyone and chose to exclude herself from activities.At some point during this conversation, a few other people overheard and soon enough there was a decent crowd of her friends around my brothers and I, listening to stories of us growing up that were blowing these people's minds because it's apparently common knowledge among their friend group that our parents were so hands on, and UN common knowledge that we even existed. I ended up having a really good time and felt like I made some new friends.After the event, apparently my sister was crying because I embarrassed her in front of all of her friends and that the work she had put in to separate herself from us \"golden children\" had been undone.AITA?",

We were in the same friend group. Mary and I live around 2 hours away from Brad and Vicky. Because Mary is a nurse she doesn't always have the time to visit Brad and Vicky with me so I go alone most of the time but when she's able she'll join me. Mary has met Vicky and seen her around 10 times in the past 4 years that Vicky is with Brad. Mary and I have been together for 6 years total and we do plan on getting engaged and married once we are more financially settled.So I asked Brad if Mary is invited and they just forgot to mention her name to which he replied that Vicky is very strict about some rules and in order to cut down costs she's enforcing a no ring no bring rule for the wedding so since Mary is \"just a girlfriend\" and doesn't have a ring to imply some formality then she's not invited. I reminded Brad that Mary and I have been together longer than he's with Vicky and that Mary is also his friend not just my partner. He says he knows and tried to talk Vicky out of it but she's very strict with that. I let it go and I was in dilemma about whether I should go to the wedding or not because of that. Mary told me she's not happy about the situation but I should go to avoid more drama. So I called them to tell them I'll attend. Vicky picked up the phone and said she's sorry about making me uncomfortable by not inviting Mary but these are the rules. I said I respect the rules I'm not necessarily happy about it though. She then for some reason started being harsh about how Mary and I are not in a serious enough relationship if after knowing each other for so long and being together for 6 years we are not engaged yet and joked that after all you never know what tomorrow brings and I could break up with Mary anytime since we haven't shown any signs of true commitment.I confronted her and told her that it's not her place to validate Mary and I's relationship and that it's really low of her to use a dumb rule just to shame and micromanage long term couples who for whatever reason haven't gotten married yet. I said I'll pass after all and not attend the wedding.She and Brad said I'm disrespecting them and their choices by choosing Mary over their wedding day and I said I don't care. Keep your rules and I'll keep my relationship because it's more important than any exclusive rules that only exist in order to shame people.I've been receiving a lot of backlash from other friends for that choice who said I'm an AH for being so bitter about something so small.

I took what some of you said into consideration: perhaps I just needed to be more patient. I decided if the noise issue escalated, then I’d do something. Otherwise, I would just suck it up (and use headphones like some of you advised).Well, today, his children screamed/shrieked four times within a one hour period in the hallway. This was right by my door about two feet away from my apartment. The fourth time it happened, I opened my door and said “please don’t scream in the hallway, guys!”Once I said this, he told me that his kids are allowed to scream in the hallway (or anywhere else in the building) that they feel like. I told him that actually, no, they’re not, according to our lease. He then told me to suck it up and to contact management and to not talk to him.After our conversation, he told all three of his kids “you can be as loud as you want in here!” and then shot me a nasty look, and proceeded to walk to the stairs. Once he said that, all three kids started squealing as loud as possible, on purpose.I sent management an email and they are talking to him first thing in the morning. I know some of you suggested I do this in the first place- I wish I did!Update 2.0: I just went down to the management office to follow up with the manager. She said she had a meeting set for today at 1pm with the resident (she immediately contacted him when I emailed her last night). But then today, he emailed her saying he could no longer make the 1pm meeting and asked why he had to come down (he’s in his apartment right now doing nothing… he doesn’t work). She told him he is in violation of his lease and it’s best if he comes down. Apparently, he didn’t reply to her. She told me that if he doesn’t come down to meet with her, she is going to draft an official lease violation letter and begin the process of eviction. I was blown away (she’s a great manager). She told me that his reaction (telling me his kids are allowed to yell & and telling the kids to keep yelling) is the reason for how she’s handling this, not purely the noise complaint. She said she’s horrified and disgusted that somebody would handle the situation this way. Her and I both agreed that it was strange he would encourage me to “not speak to him” and to “contact management” rather than just simply telling his kids “shhhh” and appreciating I said something to him directly.Update 3.0: After I talked with management, I saw my neighbor bring his children to their mother’s house. He’s been in his apartment, alone, for the last few days and hasn’t come out. He has all the blinds drawn. He posted the following status on social media “I am the perfect success in all areas of life” (my husband follows him, which is how I know this). I think he’s pretending he’s not home to avoid both myself and management. Idk what to make of it and I don’t plan on getting involved.",

I have a very good relationship with my in laws and if any of us ever had problem, we are able to talk it through. Except for one thing. My mother in law has her famous mac and cheese that everyone in her family absolutely loves.I, however, found it disgusting on day 1 but I didn't want to come off as rude and ungrateful so I pulled through it without saying anything. I told my husband about it and he said that his mother has been making it for decades perfecting the recipe and she would be deeply offended if anyone told her anything bad about her mac and cheese so I should just find the right moment to tell her. He for some reason loves it, so he didn't want to be the one to tell her. Which I totally understand because it is MY issue and I had to deal with it. It's been almost 2 years of me pretending.So 2 days ago I've decided to just tell her. It was a family dinner where my husband's parents had invited us over and of course, his mother was making her so-called \"famous mac and cheese\". I almost threw up at the smell and I couldn't bear the thought of eating it, probably because I was pregnant.So at dinner, when I was offered the mac and cheese, I politely declined and said \"no thank you\". My mother in law looked at me and asked \"why? You should eat. Good for the baby\". And I just went right out with it \"I'm sorry, but I don't like your mac and cheese. Everything else tastes delicious, but this is the one thing I simply cannot eat anymore\". She looked so deeply offended and she literally snapped \"well, thanks for being honest\" and didn't even look or speak to me for the rest of the evening. My husband was on my side and tried to speak to his mother, but all I know is that it didn't work because she has been cold to me ever since.What was wrong with the mac and cheese? Her \"perfecting the recipe\" ended up with this result: mac and cheese combined with salmon, kimchi, pineapple, seaweed salad, collard greens, onions, and garlic. I don't have a problem with the greens or onion, but the rest tastes so disgustingly wrong with mac and cheese. However, the reason why I think I might have been an asshole is because like my husband said, she has been perfecting this recipe for years, her entire family clearly loves it, and I tell her that her \"perfected and loved\" mac and cheese is terrible.Am I the Asshole?Edit. I did tell her that because I am pregnant it wasn't possible for me to stomach the ingredients, but she still didn't want to talk to me. Another edit. I'm French and my husband's family is Korean, so that will explain the ingredients. I do enjoy salmon, kimchi, and seaweed salads, but it greatly depends on which dishes it's served with. And since I've been pregnant, I've even developed an aversion to several foods that I used to love.",

	"title" : "AITA for picking my wife up from the airport 10 minutes late?",
	"body" : "Here’s what happened:My wife was due to fly in to one of the most popular airports in the world last night at around 9pm. Her landing time was 8:50pm, no checked luggage, so I told her I’d be there at 9pm.At about 8:05pm, she apparently started calling my phone but unfortunately I didn’t see/hear the calls until 8:15pm. This is because, like her, I keep my iPhone with the little “silent” switch on at all times so that it just vibrates. I didn’t hear the vibration because I had my gaming headset on and was gaming/talking with friends. Keep in mind, I wasn’t expecting ANY calls from her until after she landed…When I finally realized she was calling me (I looked at my phone by chance) I picked up and she told me that her plane had landed early (in this airport?! Unheard of!) and she told me to leave now. I just said “Ok I’ll see you soon,” and hung up. This is where the AITA comes in:I thought it was fine to finish my online match and left the house 10 minutes later. I drove to the airport and there was a ton of traffic (as usual and as expected) and I didn’t pull up to where her and her friend were waiting until about 9:05. As fate would have it, that was pretty much the original time we had planned on picking her up.To make a long story somewhat shorter, my wife sprung the fact that we had to bring her friend home as well (which I was fine with, they lived a few minutes away) and everything was fine until after we dropped the friend off. Then, my wife showed me how upset she was that I “made her wait an extra 10 minutes” and that there was a “huge difference between waiting 30 minutes and waiting 40 minutes.”At first, I kinda laughed it off and tried not to be upset back at her but inside I was thinking, “uh, hello? I’m doing you a favor by driving to the airport and picking you up in the first place. Why are you getting upset over waiting 10 minutes longer than you wanted when people sometimes wait HOURS to be picked up at the airport?”Eventually, we had a little back and forth about it but I was just sick of arguing over something so small (to me) and I wanted to just agree to disagree (and my wife was also sick of talking to me of I wasn’t going to apologize) so I went to sleep.Am I the asshole? I feel like this isn’t an “apology worthy” event. You can’t just land almost an hour early and expect your driver (even if they’re your husband) to drop EVERYTHING they’re doing and come pick you up immediately, right?Edit 1: I was not aware of the fact that you could track arrival times of flights after they left their departing location. That’s my bad. I will do better in the future.Also, someone said I’m an AH for not “missing” my wife. She was gone for one night. I did not “miss” her in the true sense of the word lol.Edit 2: I literally just showed my wife some of the responses here and she had the exactly response I thought she would (because she’s my wife…): she laughed.Someone really thought their response to me saying that I didn’t miss my wife was clever when they said: “Show her THIS one too!” Well I did… and she laughed. We’re adults in our 30’s and we’ve been together for almost a decade. A night apart isn’t shit.",

	"body" : "My husband and I have a 14 year old daughter and a 16 year old son. When our daughter was eight, she developed a very rare mouth infection that just absolutely devestated her teeth and gums. She ended up losing all her teeth in both sets, and had to have some corrective work done just so she could have regular dentures. Obviously this was very traumatic for her, and she's still in therapy to help cope to this day.Our daughter is understandably very self-conscious about this. None of her friends knew about them, in fact nobody besides her doctor and dentist know outside the family, she doesn't want people to know. She's very worried about people finding out, and won't even take her teeth out in front of the rest of us, she's worried someone will see.Her and her brother had a good relationship until he did what he did last week. He somehow recorded her taking out her teeth without her noticing, and then showed all her friends when they were over. Not only have they all turned on her, but half the school is teasing her nonstop, she even had to change her phone number because dozens of kids were texting her the most vile things imagineable.I have never been more ashamed of one of my children until that moment, I don't know where we went wrong raising him, but apparently he thought it would be funny. After I kicked out her \"friends\" who were mocking her and helped her through a panic attack, I called my father to pick him up, and told him to pack a bag and get the fuck out. He's been staying with my parents two towns over, they didn't know what happened until two days ago.That came up because driving him to school was becoming a hassle, and they wanted to know what was up. When I explained they were disgusted, but still wanted to know when they could bring him home. I asked them if they'd take care of registering him for school in their town, and they agreed but were shocked. My husband and I talked, and we just cannot have him here.His sister hates him, we're so ashamed we can't even think of calling him. It sounds awful but I don't think our relationship can recover from this, and maybe this is what he needs. No friends, no family aside from his grandparents, having to start over might just set him right. My parents are willing to keep him until he's 18, but think we're too emotionally charged to be making this decision now.",

In the last couple years or so, we've had an increase in the non-white population, including the first Muslim students I've had since before moving here--I grew up in an ethnically diverse area, so not being surrounded by multicultural people and restaurants has been an adjustment.I teach high school science, and my two Muslim students are cousins I'll call Amira and Nadia (fake names). I'm not well versed in religion, since my area of expertise is sciences, but I'd like to think I have some basic knowledge of major religions.Today, Amira was out sick, so it was just Nadia in my class. The kids were working on a worksheet while I was trying to get grading wrapped up and submitted, and when I looked up, I realized Nadia's head covering had shifted and hair on her forehead was exposed. I panicked and looked away as soon as I realized. I would have asked Amira to take Nadia into the office between my classroom and my female colleague's next door to fix it. But without Amira there, I ended up ducking into my colleague's classroom and disrupting her class (I waited until she acknowledged my presence and then waved her over to speak to her quietly) to ask her to please bring Nadia into the office to fix her head covering and I would keep an eye on her class. My colleague, Mrs. Smith, asked why I couldn't do it, and I said, \"Because I'm an unrelated man.\" She made a weird face at me but eventually said, \"fine\" and went to go get Nadia. When she came back, she was not at all polite when she said, \"It's fixed.\" I thanked her and tried to brush off her attitude, and I asked Nadia to stay back a moment after class, just long enough to apologize if I embarrassed her. She said it was fine and left.I got home at 3:30, but at 6 pm I got a call from my principal, Mrs. Waters, outside of working hours telling me that Mrs. Smith had complained about my unprofessional conduct regarding Nadia and that I am expected to attend a meeting on Monday with her, Mrs. Smith, Nadia, and her parents to discuss what should be done about my actions. I asked what I had done wrong; she refused to elaborate beyond \"unprofessional conduct\". I told her I expected my in-building union representative to be present at the meeting, or I would not go, and she said she would email our building rep.I feel ambushed.

I mostly DJ for just family and friends I’m not really a professional, just do it for a little side cash from time to time.Last weekend I got invited to DJ on the cheap at a wedding for a friend of a friend. At the wedding while everyone was on the dance floor one of the guests we’ll call him “Kevin” approached me and asked if I could play the song “Golden Hour” It was an odd request because at this time all the guests were literally hoping around and dancing but I was told to take all requests so did it anyways. When I started playing it the dance floor started to clear up and then Kevin invited a woman onto the dance floor they started slow dancing for a bit, a few people joined them (including the bride and groom) Then at that one part of the song Kevin got down on one knee and I knew right away that he was going to propose. I didn’t think it was right especially because they were in the middle of the dance floor with all eyes on them and I kinda felt like if this happened I would take the fault because I was the one to put on a romantic song out of nowhere.So instead of letting that happened as soon as he pulled out the box I started to play “BOOGIE” and turned up the volume instead. After that Kevin just side-eyed me and got up and everyone else sat down. After that nothing else really happened and the tension was very thick.After the wedding no one really brought it up and I obviously thought that I wasn’t the asshole and the friend that was friends with the bride said that I wasn’t. But then a bunch of the family started to message me. It turns out that Kevin was the bride’s brother and the family kept asking why I did that, I told them that proposing at someone else’s wedding was not appropriate. They told me that I shouldn’t have an opinion because I was just the DJ and now Kevin got publicly humiliated because some people knew this was going to happen so they were taking videos and live on Instagram so all their friends could see. I responded with “that would’ve made the newly weds hurt” but then they came back with “You shouldn’t have assumed that the bride didn’t want that.”That part got me thinking because I was mostly communicating with the bride about arrangements and she was very chatty before the wedding but after that she kept give my me one word answers. So I assume she is mad at me but then again when she payed me she almost doubled the amount for what I was asking for with a generous tip? So im not sure if the bride actually knew I think she would’ve told me.But Aita for just assuming?ETA: A lot of people said to ask the bride and groom I did but like I said their answers were vague. Bride said it was fine but it was probably just to spare my feelings. I didn’t want to push because she clearly had a lot on her mind in the moment.",

	"body" : "My fiance, Kevin(M28) and I(F30) had initially planned to get married a few years ago but due to the fact that the world was falling apart we postponed it until things calmed down and our family felt safer at a big event. We've now set a date for this coming August and as we get closer more and more thoughts keep coming to me about how it should go. My biggest issue is that Kevin's best man is no longer his best man and is now his best woman. Kevin and Amy(MTF26) have been friends for a little over a decade and when they first met up until two years ago when our wedding was supposed to happen Amy identified as a man. Kevin and Amy have always had a very close almost sibling like relationship, Kevin had been kicked out by his mom at 17 and met Amy at work shortly after. She's been very close with him and he's told me multiple times that she is the closest thing he has to any family.Initially Amy had planned to not come out to Kevin until after the wedding but after finding out that the wedding was going to be delayed she came out to him. Without consulting me Kevin told her that he was fine with all of that and that if she was at a stage were she'd like to wear a dress when our wedding happened that he would find her a dress that matched the colors he had for his groomsmen. Amy has been medically transitioning for about a year or less now and Kevin told me that we need to find her a dress. I don't have a problem with Amy and I understand how close she is to Kevin but our wedding is largely for my very traditional family. Kevin has often said that this wedding isn't that important to him and that the only reason he's doing it is because it's important to me and my family. I know that my family would have a lot of issue with Amy which Im sure would bring a lot of unwanted or outright rude attention towards her. For this reason I've asked my fiance to choose someone else to be his best man and request that Amy attend as just a guest. This has lead to a large fight between the two of us with Kevin threatening to cancel the wedding if Amy can't be part of the wedding party because he wants someone from his family in it.

	"title" : "AITA for telling my in future in-laws that it's not a wedding gift unless it's given to both people and telling my fiancee I don't want to live in a house I don't own?",
	"body" : "My fiancee [27F] and I [29M] grew up very differently. I was an immigrant who moved here when I was 6, and we were definitely struggling a lot. My parents worked extremely hard to provide for me and siblings, and they always prioritized our education over everything. My dad always told me it was his dream to live in a house that he owned, since we'd always rented, but he couldn't save up enough since we were renting in expensive areas with good schools. Unfortunately, both of my parents passed away before being able to realize that dream. My dad passed away when I was 17 and my mom passed away almost 3 years ago due to covid.My fiancee grew up fairly wealthy. Like private schools, designer clothes, 3-4 international vacations per year flying first or business class the whole way. I was able to attend college thanks to student loans, scholarships, and part-time jobs, which delayed my graduation a bit, while her parents were able to fairly easily cover all expenses themselves. However, I'm the last person to say that my fiancee hasn't earned everything she's gotten. She's an extremely intelligent person, and besides funding her education, her parents are in no way responsible for her accomplishments.My fiancee and I met 6 years ago when we started working at the same company, in the same position, at the same time, after graduating from college. We hit it off almost instantly and it didn't take long for us to start dating. Both of us still work at the company, however I've progressed through the career ladder a bit more quickly than she has and now make just over twice what she does. I'll be the first to admit that this is completely undeserved and I've benefitted from a lot of luck and definitely some sexism as well, since we work in a male-dominated field. Still, that has allowed me to aggressively attack my student loans, and once they were payed off, I put that into saving up for a down payment on a house as a way to fulfill my parents dreams.I proposed about 6 months, and things have been great so far. However, this past weekend, we were at her family's house, when her parents told us that for a wedding present, they were going to give us a house. My fiancee was overjoyed, and although I was also happy, I wanted to know the details as well. Pretty quickly, her parents told us that the house would be in her name only, and that they expected us to sign a prenup to protect any (and only) pre-marriage assets \"just in case\". I was insulted that they thought I was after their money at all since I make more than she does anyway, and I ended up telling them that they can't call it a wedding present if they only give it to one person. I then told my fiancee I refused to live in a house that I don't own, and she knows exactly why. All three of them got very upset with me. So AITA?Edit/Update: So I was requested to add some information that I included in the comments into my post, and I also just had a long conversation with my fiancee and my in-laws, so I have a small update to share as well.Here's the info from the comments:The hilarious part of the whole prenup conversation was that they basically said that they expected the prenup to only cover premarital and inherited assets. They said they would absolutely refuse to accept any clauses that include future assets. So if I want to own a home where only my name is on the title, I have to purchase it before the marriage and also make sure to never use any of my wife's money to pay the mortgage or anything. Apparently they already had their lawyer write the whole thing up, but wanted to give me a heads-up so I can retain my own lawyer to review it. I have a suspicion that any lawyer is going to think it's massively unfair just base on how they've described it, and I'm assuming that they think I'll just get a cheap lawyer because of my upbringing. Admittedly, I don't know any better, so this is kind of difficult for me to determine what's fair and isn't fair here, but it doesn't seem fair to me.Besides that though, it's also just a personal thing. I want to live in a house that I own. Not them. Not my wife alone. I'm happy to live in a home that both my wife and I own, but not one she owns on her own. I don't someone else living in the home that I own. I want to live in it myself.I also should mention that currently, my fiancée and I share our finances. She makes about 120k use and I make about 250k usd. We split things according to income, so I pay around two-thirds and she pays around one-third. Based on our conversations, my fiancee and I both expected this arrangement to continue after marriage.As for the update, well I'll start with my fiancee's older sister [29F if it's relevant] calling me out of the blue a few hours ago to tell me that her parents did not ask her husband to sign a prenup before they got married. Both of my fiancee's sisters and my fiancee's BIL were at the dinner where her parents talked about the house, so they both heard the whole conversation. My fiancee's sister thought I deserved to know. My fiancee's BIL comes from a well-off family as well, but I don't know how well-off or whether they are on the same level as my fiancee's family or just upper middle class. Their wedding was pretty extravagant. My fiancée's family is white and American, as is the BIL. I am Pakistani. I don't believe her parents are racist, but it seemed like this information was important according to the comments.Anyway, about 3 hours ago, my fiancee finally came home. She had stayed at her parent's house because we'd gotten into quite the argument. I was expecting her to continue the argument, but she actually came and apologized straight away. Apparently her younger sister [22F] chewed her out after I left her parent's house. She really laid into my fiancee on how she was being inconsiderate because everyone knew how important owning my home was to me. She also said that her parents weren't treating me right, or equally. That made my fiancee see my side, as she said, but she was too embarrassed, which is why she didn't come home last night. If you can't tell, I'm a huge fan of my fiancee's little sister right now. She's always been a sort of no-nonsense firecracker type of girl, while my fiancee is a bit of a people pleaser and definitely a Daddy's girl, and she's kind of always vying for her father's approval. My fiancée has even said she knows she needs to work through that before we get married. I'm going to buy her sister a cupcake.Then showed her the post and she got pretty uncomfortable reading a lot of the comments, especially the ones saying that she doesn't care about me. She also got really uncomfortable when she read the comments about her parents being racist. I pressed on that a bit and she went on to mention that they've never been overtly racist, but they did make comments when we first started dating about being concerned about future, specifically about our children looking different and being treated poorly by her family. They asked her many times if she was sure about me. Like I said, I don't believe they're racist, but I do understand that they probably have some biases. This was also the case when they said they didn't want to do any traditional Pakistani events for the wedding. That was fine for me anyway, so I didn't really care, but now it makes me think a bit.I explained to her how I was feeling like I was going into this as an unequal partner, and she absolutely agreed that it wasn't fair. She even said she was going to tell her parents that she was going to refuse to sign the prenup. I told her to slow down, because she was going between extremes. I told her that we still needed to get the prenup because her family was already having difficulty accepting me and this was going to make it worse. However, I told her that under no circumstances was I signing anything her parents had a part in drafting, and that we would each retain our own lawyers outside of her parents' influence and get something that is fair and equitable. She agreed.We then talked about the house, and she said she was going to tell her parents that she wasn't going to accept unless both of our names were on it. I told her to slow down again, and I got her to agree to me paying for a quarter of it. My initial proposal was to pay half, but she said that what I said about it being a wedding present so it should be for both of us was true. So we came to the agreement that we would each get half ownership of the house, with her parents paying for 75% of it and me using the money I have saved plus a small mortgage for the other 25%. Both of our names will be on the title.We then called her parents together and told them our plan. They grumbled about it a bit initially, especially because her dad was still upset that I had been so ungrateful, but eventually, we were able to talk it through, and they agreed to the plan. I doubt that this is the last I hear about this, but at least for now, it seems like the situation is mostly resolved.",

	"body" : "My parents called for a family meeting last Sunday and said they were realizing that we didn't have the happy little tight knit family they had expected to have. They expressed that we had all been closer when we were little kids. For context it's me (16m), my brother James (14m) and my other brother Easton (12m). But now it felt like we never spent time as brothers, especially me and James, and that sharing a room they would have expected more from us. My parents said they wanted us to all be totally open and honest about how we felt and to express if we had any issues with the family to get out of the way. They said they weren't going to take a turn until after the three of us spoke first. And we couldn't leave until we opened up and said everything.I told them I felt like they had somewhat unrealistic goals, that they ignored some stuff that had been mentioned to them in the past that would have made the lack of closeness less of a surprise, and that it was weird for them to pretend they had no idea of anything going on.I admitted that I hate sharing a room with James. That personality wise, he and I clash, and that he relies too much on being the younger brother and getting his own way, which annoys me. I said I had told them this before. James will set up these sleepover nights for him and me on the floor and he'll expect me to play football outside with him until it's close to midnight and then go in and watch movies that bore me to tears and sleep in our sleeping bags instead of our beds. I said he started insisting we do things he enjoys when we were like 8 and 10 and ever since that point hanging out with him has not been fun for me, it has not made me feel closer to him. I admitted that I would rather share with Easton. I also said I had brought this stuff to my parents attention before. And even complained when he was messing up my side of the room and left me to clean up, which my parents expected me to do instead of him. I also mentioned that I hate hanging out with his friends who I have nothing in common with.I told my parents they overlook James being mean to Easton. That it might be due to jealousy and resentment that I'm closer to Easton or it might be due to Easton being the youngest. But they would never let me say to James what James can say to Easton.I also said they treat us like we're little kids. They will tell us to go hang with much younger kids and do their activities at family houses and they'll tell us no video games until we play outside. And that even after 16 years of knowing me, they still can't accept that I don't like sports and it's not my idea of fun to kick a ball or run around and it never has been.James was upset about the stuff I said about him. Especially about not wanting to hang out with him and his friends. My parents were furious with me and said I had no right to say all that. I said I was doing what they asked and they said that wasn't what they asked for.AITA?",

Most responses were not what I was expecting and really gave me a lot to think about.As surprised as I was that so many people said to tell Jamie, I did realise it was the right thing to do. So, I texted him and told him that Kate was insisting I dressed a certain way. Jamie called and explained. A couple of months ago, Jamie and Kate were out with a few of his friends (these same friends that I mentioned in my comments are not fond of Kate), and everyone had had a lot to drink. They were talking about how they met their SOs, and the story of Jamie and Kate meeting came up. Apparently during the telling of the story Kate asked Jamie why he had decided to hit on her rather than me, and one of his friends joked that it was because he knew he didn't have a shot with \"the hot one\" - me. Kate asked if this was true, and Jamie having had WAY too much to drink, explained in a way that made it sound kind of true.He said he did notice me that night and thought I was attractive, just seeing me. He said he would never have approached me because he knew he would never have a chance with someone like me, so in that way, his friend was right. He said that speaking to Kate was the absolute best outcome because he loves her and plans on spending the rest of his life with her, but even knowing this, Kate has taken this extremely hard, and even though she says she is over it, he's noticed changes in her behaviour that seem to be related to that. He also admitted that he'd been planning to propose to Kate at the party and that is why he'd wanted me to be there, but after hearing this on top of the way she has been handling the situation previously, he won't be doing that anymore.After speaking to Jamie, I called Kate. She admitted that she had tied a lot of her self worth in the fact that she'd finally been picked over me and now it felt like that wasn't true. She apologised for trying to solve her insecurities through me, but also said she wasn't sure she would be able to have me in her life as much as I had been with the way she's been feeling. As hurt as I was, I said I understood. She said she still wanted me to come to the party, since I'd helped organise it and she obviously dropped the absurd dress code, so I will be going to the party. I trust that Kate will communicate her boundaries to Jamie but I don't plan on inviting him to any more events for the foreseeable future.I'm really sad that I've probably lost a longtime friend over the drunken awkwardness of other people, but I also get that Kate can't help how she feels, and frankly it's for the best not to be in a secret competition. So, yeah, I'm hurt, but I'm going to the party. Not a satisfying update, but an honest one.UPDATE: going through these comments has actually brought up a couple of memories that have, in hindsight, made me a bit uncomfortable, and I actually don’t think I will end up going to this party. As much as the mutual friends will have questions and I don’t know how much of the truth I will end up telling, I feel too weird right now to continue to be involved in this situation.",

	"body" : "I (28F) have a three year old German Shepherd (Lou) who is the sweetest dog I‘ve ever met. She’s very cuddly and loving once she‘s gotten used to you. However, she was abused as a puppy and has separation anxiety. (EDIT: we’ve been working with a professional trainer and she’s been making improvements) but currently, leaving her home alone for more than an hour simple isn‘t possible (EDIT: and my brother lives 45 minutes away). It‘s hard to gain her trust, so getting someone to watch her on short notice is nearly impossible.The last time I visited my brother (39M), his wife (42F) stepped on Lou‘s tale and quite obviously, it hurt. She didn‘t bite or even try do do so, but she barked quite loudly before running to hide behind me.I asked my SIL whether she way alright and she said she was, so I didn’t think anything else of it. After all, she‘d known Lou for almost 2 years before the incident.But when my brother invited me to his birthday party next weekend, he told me to leave Lou at home and when I asked for the reason, he told me SIL thought she was too aggressive to be around the guests.She isn‘t, but it‘s their house, their rules and I want to respect her wishes, so I simply called my usual dog sitter who told me that unfortunately, they weren’t available. Anyone else who has watched Lou in the past will also be at my brother‘s party so I don‘t have anyone to watch her.I told my brother I could eithera) bring Lou and keep her on leash at all times,or b) take Lou with me and take turns with my mum walking her around the neighbor so I could be able to stay a bit without his wife having to face my dogor c) come over (with Lou in the car) to congratulate him and bring over his present but leave shortly afterwards as I don‘t want her to be alone in the car for more than 15 minutes.He told me that he didn’t like any of these options because his wife didn’t want my 'aggressive dog' on their property, in their driveway or in their neighborhood in general.I apologized and told him if that was the case, I wouldn’t be able to come at all.He has told me he’s disappointed but especially my SIL has been bombarding me with texts about how I was selfish for putting my dog before my brother, and that I was an AH of a sister to do that to him on his 40th birthday.I think I have proposed reasonable enough compromises (EDIT: and because all of them were declined, I don’t see what other options I have left except for staying home) but in the end, I‘d still like to hear the opinions of unbiased internet strangers to be sure.",

I know this will make it worse so I told her noMy sister was quite upset so she  ask me was I ashamed of her and demanded me to explain why I couldn’t support herI was so angry at this stage I screamed this was all her fault that I will never support her or her life choices and I wished she wasn’t my sister because my life has been hell yet she has the nerve to play victimIt got really heated to the point my dad walked me into my room and told me stay there, mom came in later took my phone and told me pack my stuff I’ll be staying with my aunt (dads sister) for the foresee able future because she can’t stand to be around me right nowI can hear them in my sisters room she’s still crying and moms comfortingEdit - hi guys well this post blew up overnight I’ve a mini update for everyone but first I want to clear some things up that keep getting said in the comments1- First there’s a few people in the comments saying “well who did you tell” or “you must have shown people that’s how they found out” I don’t know how anyone found out maybe they were watching movies and Recognise her as we live in a small town were everyone knows everyone.I’ll probably never find out but I sure as shit didn’t go around showing videos of my sister anymore thinking it lacks common sense2- for those of you saying it’s none of my business and she can do what she wants, yes she can do what she wants but I’m being bullied and harassed over so it is my business because it’s affecting me3- I know people mean well telling me I should get my school involved but we are on summer break so it’s all been happening out of school and as they’re so many involved it will only be worse on me4- some people kept saying I’m leaving out stuff what more do you actually want to know? The only thing I’ve left out was the details of the bullying for privacy reasonsSo here’s the mini updateMy dad came into my room last night to give me back my phone and we ended talking about everything I reopened my socials to show him what I’ve been dealing with and told him about what my mother said which he got super angry about. My parents have been fighting non stop since about 6am which is scary because I’ve never heard my dad yell before. Basically he told my mom that if anyone is leaving it’s going to be her and her daughter prematurely(we ended up leaving)  because he’s sick of her ruining everyone’s relationships and lives over my sister career, I think I heard him say he get some shit at work too but I did clearly heard him say he wants a divorce don’t know if it was the heat of the moment or if he’s serious thoMy sister came into room telling me all this was my fault and I’m disgusting person with internalised misogyny,she said  I should have came to her and she would have help me deal with it by some stupid comebacks that I’ve seen people also mention in the comments. I told her this was all her fault because everything leads back to her and unlike our mom I’m not gonna enable her or lie to her about the reality of the situation and what I’m going through is her fault and I’ll have to probably move schools. She told me she’ll talk to me when I’m mature enough to have an adult conversation and lived in the real worldI told her when I leave this house I will never speak to her and our mother ever again. She left the room in a huff and I heard her down stairs screaming at my dadI locked the door and blasted my music so I couldn’t hear anymore I dare not open it when my mother demanded to speak to me,As of now my mother and sister are out of the house my parents agreed that me and my dad will go to my aunts for a week so everyone can cool down , my dad said to me he might just look for a permanent place up there for us (me&him) but again he’s angry so who’s knowsI might update in a few weeks if something happens but I do know my relationship with my sister and especially my mother will never be ok again",

	"title" : "WIBTA for not inviting my poly friend's partners to my wedding?",
	"body" : "I (25F) am getting married in September. My husband, Mike and I are doing a big wedding for 250 guests. I've always dreamed of having a storybook wedding. I asked my best friend Marissa (25F) to be my MOH and she happily agreed. She's been a huge help to me in every step of planning the wedding.Marissa is in a poly relationship and she has 3 partners. Greg (24M), Brandon (27M) and Ace (22NB). She's been with Greg for 5 years and was the first partner she had. They added Brandon and Ace over the course of their relationship with Ace being the newest member. They all date each other and seem to be happy. I don't really \"get\" it if I'm being honest but it's not my business.However the issue came into play when Mike (32M) pulled me aside and said while he loves Marissa he didn't feel like spending the wedding explaining her love life to his family. Which I understand, they are very conservative and hardly accept LGBT people as is let alone a LGBT polyset. I had already reserved 4 spots of Marissa & co but my husband suggested he invite a few coworkers to take the partners spot and Marissa could come alone. I didn't want to ruin his big day so I agreed reluctantly.I know I should have told Marissa from the get go but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. So when invite went out she called me up immediately and asked why she didn't have a plus 3 invite. I explained to her exactly what I said above and she just said \"oh\" and hung up.Next thing I know Brandon is calling me and begging me to reconsider saying they promise they won't act like they are in a relationship but they want to be there for me. Except I can hear Greg in the background telling him tell me to fuck off and that I'm am asshole and he doesn't even want to go. I explain to Brandon that I already gave their \"spots\" to Mike's coworkers. Brandon says okay thank you and hangs up. Marissa texts me the next day saying she isn't coming unless they can go.Mike said he can't uninvite his co-workers now so it's not his problem. I told him I would add them and pay the costs and he just said if I want to spend the whole time explaining their relationship to people than so be it but he isn't wasting his time doing it and will just send people my way.Our other friends think I'm an asshole but Mike's friend and a few of my non mutual friends don't think i am. Just want some more unbiased opinions.Edit: I am the asshole, that's for sure. I followed a lot of advice in this post and asked Mike what he thinks in the morning. He said to talk to Marissa first and see what she wants and we'll make it work. I also had him read over the post himself and he said that a lot of the comments opened his eyes on how he himself was coming off. So we both decided to call Marissa together and beg for forgiveness.We called her and she was happy to talk. We explained our side of things but acknowledged that it was a massive fuck up and could have been handled so much better. We invited her and her partners, obviously and said we would be happy to whatever it takes to have them forgive us. She asked her partners about it and Brandon and Greg both agreed they would prefer to just \"split\" the set up. So Greg and Marissa would be a couple for the wedding and Brandon and Ace would be a couple. They however would need to talk to Ace first (they were at work) and that they would get back to me. So that's where we currently stand.Edit2: I never told Marissa I was inviting her partners, I just had a list of invites with Mike. I'm still the asshole but wanted to explain that.Last edit: Ace got out of work a few hours ago and we all got on speaker phone and had a long conversation with this post pulled up. The crew was all happy to be defended but did think people went a little harder than they would have even Greg. He actually laughed at me calling him self absorbed because he is lol. Anyway. We're all good :) they are coming. They gave permission to tell Mike's parents. We called them after and they understood but said don't let Nanni know or she'll be asking questions all night. It's been a huge relief and I think we learned how to communicate better as a couple.",

	"body" : "So I know from experience that Reddit isn't the most understanding towards parents of young kids but I really just want a third party opinion because this situation is driving me crazy and my family are saying I need to get over itI (F30's) live with my partner and our two kids, ages 7 and 3.My older sister \"Ava\" (also F30's) and her husband recently purchased a house in the local area. It's a super nice place with a big yard and as you can probably guess from the title, a swimming pool.Ava recently hosted a barbecue at her place. It wasn't a huge event, she invited me, our parents and our other siblings.She mentioned letting the kids play in the pool so I only assumed my kids would get to be includedWe are potty training although my youngest is still in diapers at the moment.At the barbecue, I was getting my youngest ready for the pool by changing him into a swim diaper. Ava pulled me aside and told me she doesn't think it's \"hygienic\" for my youngest to play in the pool, since swim diapers don't hold pee and she asked that he doesn't swim in the pool with the other kids playing in itI didn't think this was fair and told Ava that lots of people, adults and kids, pee in the pool and it would be no different at a public pool so what's the problem?She was being really condescending and wouldn't listen to me at all and said that he can play in the pool when he's \"toilet trained\", and said it's not fair on the other kids.At this point my son was crying because he wanted to swim in the pool and I told Ava she was being cold but it's her house and her pool so do what you want. Ava accused me of trying to guilt trip her and told me to just drop it.I was getting upset myself at this point and i told our parents and other siblings about what Ava did. They told me it's not a big deal and that it's not worth arguing with her over and try not to let it bother me. I wasn't happy with this because this essentially means they're siding with her and downplaying how she treated me and my son.I left the barbecue early with my family because we didn't feel welcome after that.The next day Ava messaged me a whole paragraphs and said that she's \"sorry\" that I'm upset and that she wasn't trying to exclude my son for the sake of it. It was a super non-apology and I told her I don't want to hear it and that she's damaged her relationship with her nephew and shes not the one who had to deal with him being upset.Ava snapped at me out of nowhere and said I'm being dramatic. I told her to grow up and said that I have a very valid reason to be mad, and she needs to stop acting like a teenager.Ava showed these messages to everyone and everythings just a bit up in the air. I feel like I'm right here but the rest of my family doesn't seem to agree.",

	"body" : "My husband (51M) and I (48F) have 6 children (19M, 16F, 14F, 13M, 11M, + 5F), Our 16 y/o, Gianna is a junior in high school, our son Ryker (13) is in 7th grade.The kids are starting to have their school dances, the 7th grade dance is later this month and the junior banquet is in early May. We have gone shopping for dress clothes for all the dances. We bought Gianna’s dress a few weeks ago.Gianna has usually been a good kid throughout her life, this school year has been slightly harder than others though. Around 2 months ago, we got a call from Gianna’s choir teacher saying that Gianna and a few other altos were making racist jokes about some of the new pieces she introduced, including an Urdu song and a song from Honduras.We talked to Gianna about her actions and we made her write an apology to her teacher as well as write a 5 paragraph essay on why it is important to respect music from other cultures.Ryker has a friend from his baseball team who is Honduran (he was born here but his mom was born in Honduras and his dad is mixed), when Ryker heard out about this he was quite mad and asked if he could have his friend come over, and teach her about the culture there. We allowed this and he came over with his parents and they made food and Ryker and his friend taled about sports and music there, Gianna was very clearly not enjoying it but we made her engage anyways.Our daughter and a group of her friends, including her boyfriend,  got in trouble last week for making racist jokes again. We took her phone to investigate to see where this hatred could be coming from.Ryker had his friends over for a sleepover the night we found out about this, during dinner the boys were talking about how their coach would never let them live though it if they bullied a kid or made racist jokes. My husband and I tried helping guide them through their feelings, like asking them about the diverse athletes they liked.Gianna was hanging out with friends at the mall that night, some of whom were doing dress shopping for the upcoming dance.Our son and the boys decided to use this as an opportunity to trash the dress, using mud, drinks and cutting a few holes in the dress. We found out when Gianna came home, entered her room and saw the dress.The boys were laughing and Ryker said they did it because Gianna didn’t deserve to go to the banquet, and saying how there “could be kids that look like” his Honduan friend.We told Ryker we were trying our best to educate her in a very white town (we’re also white). We told him that this was the wrong way to take out his anger and that as a result, he couldn’t go to his 7th grade dance. Ryker told us to shut up and spent the rest of his night in his room with the boys.Ryker texted my parents and siblings as well as my in-laws, a few have called us and came to his defense, saying he’s just a kid who was trying to cope with anger. Now we’re unsure if we are in the wrong. AITA?Update:Hello, I first want to thank everyone for the advice, yesterday was insane processing just how many comments I got and also talking to family including my siblings, parents and in-laws about where to go from here.I get it, my husband and I were in the wrong. We first talked to Ryker, He told us how mad he was at Gianna, he told us about how some girls in his middle school have been racist towards his friend so he wanted to protect him. He told us him and his friends made the plot together bc they felt like she could hurt someone if she didn’t face backlash. We asked him if he regretted his decision purely to see his mood, he immediately said no. We did go over anger management though.We then talked to Gianna and things went much worse than we expected, she defended herself and used much worse language than what she got in trouble at school for. She used slurs and called Ryker a crybaby.My family and my husband’s family all live close to us. We decided to have dinner with my siblings, parents and in-laws. We asked for advice, discussed everything, and had them question Gianna and Ryker some more. Again, Gianna expressed much worse sentiments than we could have ever imagined. Ryker was more put together, and went into depth about his feelings.After our families had left, my husband and I went in our bedroom to discuss what punishments would be.We first spoke to Ryker, we told him he could go to the dance and then discussed the money with him, we decided to not make him pay for financial damages to us but we asked him how he felt if he bought something with his hard earned money from gold caddying, he eventually said he understood our initial anger after that thought experiment. Off the recommendations of my brother, we also suggested looking into how he could channel his desire for social justice into sports, the most important thing in Ryker’s life besides his friends.We then talked to Gianna, we told her she would not be attending the junior banquet and told her she would have to read and write a report on 2 books from a list of books on racism, some commentators have made recommendations and we will look into them. She has also lost all of her devices except her school chromebook until further notice.We also apologized to Ryker for holding him to higher standards simply because he’s the high achiever of the family. He also mentioned the fact we don’t give him enough attention because of that.We are looking into different therapies such as family therapy or individual therapy for Gianna, possibly Ryker and even our other kids.https://www.reddit.com/user/mdr739/comments/12dqwpq/aita_update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3",

	"body" : "I know it sounds silly, but I would like an outside opinion and accept any judgment. Ihave 4 children and 5 grandchildren. For all of my grandchildren, I made a knitted clothes and hat for them to come out of the maternity ward.It started with my first grandchild and all the ones that followed, my kids asked me to do it.It is customary in my country for clothes to be a certain color to represent something good (health, peace and protection).I don't do it professionally and I work, so it's something I do in my spare time and it takes months because I do it with all the love and care. Nor do I force my children to accept it, most ask right after they announce the pregnancy if I can make the clothes.My oldest daughter, I'll call Pam, announced that she was pregnant and asked me to make it for her daughter (we found out later).Clearly I did, she chose the color red and honestly, it was one of the prettiest jobs I've ever done and finished within 7 months of her pregnancy.She gave birth about 20 days ago, my granddaughter was born healthy, perfect and bright.I was heartbroken on the way out of the maternity ward when I found out that my granddaughter would not wear the clothes I made, but one that Pam got from her in-laws from a very expensive brand (like Gucci).I didn't say anything to her, but in a conversation with my son I just vented that I was heartbroken about it and that I wouldn't have any problems if she didn't ask and I didn't do it in the sense of exposing my daughter or anything, but just after my son insisted on me talking because he realized that I was a little down.The word spread among my childrens until it reached Pam in the form of a scolding for someone else.She called me angrily saying that she didn't believe I was jealous of an clother and that her daughter could wear at any time, but that I decided to make this moment about me and not celebrate my granddaughter's life.I'm lost, I'm just heartbroken that I've been making something so lovingly for months for a specific moment and not been told at any point that she wouldn't use it.My family is divided, some criticizing me and others on my sideAITA?Yes, she asked to this.I'll give the context better and leave it to you.I stayed with her through delivery and the following 2 weeks.At their request, because my daughter was in pain from the c-section and my son-in-law was taking care of my granddaughter's paperwork, I put the clothes on her.There was a baby suitcase with the sets separated into packages and a label for what they  for. There was only one for leave the maternity and there was that clother (and nothing else), I even took a look at the suitcase and asked if it was that package, she confirmed that it was what had this clothes.And no, I didn't comment on anything while I was there, because she was really stressed, tired and didn't need a comment like this.I didn't comment with her and I just commented with my son, because it was an extremely personal veng with no intention of reaching Pam but the word spread.",

She didn't wanna say much and told me that I should come over.I ended up going. Ex and her friend were there, kiddo was at school. Honestly felt completely different than I was expecting to feel. Anyways, she had the other breast removed, quickly found out that it spread out and she was just starting with her therapy. Ex suggested to stay until kid returns. I remember what you guys said, but I just couldn't do it. I stayed, because I just wanted to see. I guess some of you were right about him remembering me, or not. Walks in, says hi, and disappears somewhere (I guess his room?). Walks back after a min and starts staring at me - \".Papa? Papa!\" and runs at me. Ex starts crying out loud, and I tear up, barely holding myself from crying (I don't know if it's because of her crying or because of kiddo remembering). It was a great day.To cut it short, I started visiting her 2-3 times a week, but sadly, things were starting to get worse. Seeing her getting weaker and weaker, I decided to go through with the guardianship. Hired a lawyer, did tons of paperwork, interviews, investigation,  and finally found the bio dad. Ex narrowed a list of people, and even without the dna test, you could see from miles that kiddo was a mini version of one of the guys. Both ex's mom & bio dad signed the consent and waiver, but even if they didn't, they probably wouldn't have a chance to make a difference. After two months, judge made his decision and i finally became a legal guardian.Sadly, ex passed away, roughly 3 months ago. After which I started the adoption process, that still goes on. Had 2 court hearings so far, and another one will be in ~2 weeks. So far, things went well, so hoping for the best.I know that I missed a lot of details (not sure if it would be important, but also due to the character limit), but I will be answering any questions you guys have, in the comments below.",

	"body" : "Edit: I will make this clear she may not be my kid by blood but everything else she is my daughter and has been for about 10 years. Also Sabrina is engaged so noooooo she doesn’t want to get back with my son, and I don’t want them to either.  Yes I have invited Bethany to do stuff with me, it’s always been a no.I won’t disown Sabrina by disinviting her to family events, because that is actually I will be saying. I will be saying I don’t see her as family if I disinvite her to family events she has gone to for about 10 years. This is asking me to chose between two children, I will not disown one.Post:My son was dating Sabrina, they started in highschool and broke up when they were in college. It was a long relationship and I became really close to her. She is in my eyes our daughter. Her family are awful people and she sees us as her parental figures. She even is planning to have my husband walk her down the isle when she gets married.Now when they broke up, relationship just died, we didn’t drop her since she is our kid at this point. My son wasn’t happy but moved on, so she gets invited to family events and has for years.  My son now 27 is married to Bethany and she is a nice person. We never clicked, we don’t have much in common and they live 2 hours away so it’s hard to plan stuff to get to know her more. Really I’m sure it will grow in time.Now we had a picnic and all the family members were invited. So Sabrina was there as normal and I thought the night was nice. Bethany come up to me at the end of the night and expressed that she is uncomfortable with her husband ex being everywhere and if I couldn’t invite her for family stuff. I told her no and that Sabrina is part of the family and has been part of the family longer than she has. If their is an actually valid reason like her rude then I would consider it but she has done nothing.  She left and my son has called me and called me an asshole for picking her over my now real family.AITA, my husband thinks she is crazy but I know we can be bias.",

	"body" : "I’ve been with my wife for 8 years now. She has primary custody of her daughter, Santana (9). Santana sees her dad, Mark every other weekend and some holidays.As I’ve been one of Santana’s primary caretakers for the past 7 years (since I moved in with her mom), I’ve taken care of her more than Mark has and we are quite close. My wife and I went onto have 2 children together, who are now 5 years and 18 months. I’ve been a stay at home dad since the 5 year old was born. As a result, I’m the one making lunches, driving kids to activities, etc. That includes for Santana.Mark has always felt insecure about my place in Santana’s life. I’ve always encouraged her relationship with her dad, while also been a place she can go to in order to vent about both her parents. I’ve never asked her to call me dad, but I’ve made it clear I love her the same as her siblings. And she’s also said she loves me and considers me her second dad.Mark also mocks me for my SAHD role. My wife always shuts him down and I just ignore him. He has in the past jokingly called me Santana’s nanny and I just roll my eyes and say “whatever you think, Mark”. I really don’t see him much as my wife will take Santana to her dad’s and pick her up.However, yesterday, my wife was sick and asked me to pick up Santana. She really couldn’t get out of bed and I knew Mark wasn’t going to drive out to us (he’s refused in the past). So, I went over to his place to pick her up.He was throwing a BBQ and had some family there. I had never met any of them. Santana ran into my arms, excited to see me and shouting my name. A few people looked at Mark curiously. He laughed and said “That’s Santana’s nanny”. I shook my head and said “I’m her step-father, Greg. Nice to meet you all.” Mark turned red and barely said goodbye to Santana. I didn’t think much of it outside Mark just being Mark.However, Mark texted my wife later saying I “humiliated him” and given I’d likely never see those people again, I shouldn’t have said anything. My wife told him he’s overreacting and he then texted me, saying I had no right to correct him in his own home. He asked what was the big deal in his family thinking I’m her nanny?AITA?",

I ask why and she said that she planned on putting only $50 in the gift but the cheapest coffee machine she could find was around $80 so I needed to put the $30 she added for the machine.That confused me because, if she planned on only putting a certain amount in the gift (that I, once again, didn’t ask for) then why not give up the coffee machine idea and buy something that actually was $50?She said she didn’t care about paying more if it made me happy, I said well clearly you do care otherwise you wouldn’t ask me to pay the extra $30? She said it was just a matter of principle and that if I had manner I’d pay her. She then left.She later texted my husband that she was waiting on the $30 and would take back the coffee machine if I didn’t. I told my husband to respond that she could come take it back cause I was not gonna give her the $30.My husband is not okay with that because he got \"attached\" to the machine, whatever that means, and to just give her the $30. I told my husband if he wanted to keep the machine then he should give his mom the money she wants.He said I needed to do it because the gift is originally mine, even though I never asked for it. He said I was making this harder than it need to be and was selfish to not pay the extra $30 for the coffee machine his mom got me, especially knowing that he likes it.I have a hard time seeing how I’m wrong so I’m coming here because there might be a chance that i AM in the wrong.Should I just give his mom the $30 like she asks and be done with it?",

	"title" : "AITA for nuking my niece's social media accounts?",
	"body" : "So, a couple of weeks ago I (M35) had my sister (F39) and her family (including Niece, F11) over for a barbecue. We had a pretty good time, with the exception of Niece who was pretty much constantly on her phone recording tiktoks. Slightly annoying but ultimately not my kid, not my problem.I've talked to my sister a while ago about being careful what Niece is putting online, protecting her identity etc. My sister brushed it off, saying that Niece was sensible enough not to do anything stupid. I figure I'd try and bridge the gap, so I ask Niece what she's recording, \"It's a tiktok, you're old, you wouldn't get it\". I work in tech, so it's not like I don't know what I'm talking about, but I decide to let it slide and do some digging later.Turns out Niece has used her full government name to register for Tiktok, with links to her public instagram with the same name, so I did what any reasonable person would do - reported everything for being under 13. Instagram, Youtube, Tiktok, everything I could find. With the nature of tiktok trends, some of the stuff on there was stuff that 11 year-olds probably shouldn't be doing, and definitely shouldn't be recording.Fast forward to today, Sister calls me and asks me if I can have a look at Niece's ipad. Apparently she can't log into any of her accounts and she's having a meltdown about it. I talk her through it and it quickly becomes apparent that the accounts are blocked and asking for ID. I'm in two minds whether to tell her it was me that reported the account or just tell her to submit the ID knowing it'll get Niece permabanned.So, AITA for nuking my nieces social media?EDIT: Thanks for your advice, seems like most people are with me on this. I'm not going to tell her it was me, I'm assuming she'll probably create new accounts and if those come up I'll speak to her mum.There were a couple of bits a few people mentioned, so I'll add them here rather than copypaste a load:\"you banned her government name, she'll just use a pseudonym\" - Good. It's one less thing people can use to track her down, and one less thing someone can hold over her if something goes wrong. I'm not stupid enough to think this will stop her, but maybe she'll start to understand that she needs to be smarter about it.\"She's not your kid to parent/You should have spoken to her mum about it\" - True, and one of the reasons why I questioned if IWTA. My sister is great in many ways, but tech isn't one of them. I tried it the reasonable way, I probably overstepped but I don't think removing someone from a dangerous situation is a problem.\"You're invading her privacy\" - She's 11, posting stuff publicly under her government name. If you think any of that constitutes \"privacy\", I don't know what to tell you.",

	"body" : "Hi, I'm F25.Recently, my colleague (F31) invited me to her wedding, which happened yesterday. I was super excited and happy for her. Just in case, I asked her if there was any guest fees - she said \"No, you don't need to pay me anything\".On the day itself, everything went well until it the reception (dinner time). To my shock, I was presented with a wedding menu that had prices on it. (For example: Steak ---- $50) Everything was ridiculously expensive, including the vegetarian options.At first, I wanted to question her because well, she lied to me that I didn't have to pay for anything. But it was her wedding and I didn't want to spoil her day by embarrassing her in front of everyone.However, the only other option was to simply not eat, as I didn't bring enough money for both a meal and a ride back. But this was completely unfavourable as I had skipped my lunch to 'save space' for the wedding meal and was pretty hungry.Suddenly, I remembered that I saw a McDonald's about five minutes away from the hotel. As tactfully as I could, I asked the bride if I could make a quick stop to McDonald's as I didn't bring enough money for the reception meal. I said that I'd be back in time for the gift ceremony and cake.I thought she'd agree, but to my horror - she got really upset. She said that she put in so much effort to get this \"Michelin-star restaurant service\" yet I still wasn't happy. That I was trying to bring her down by saying that I'd rather eat McDonald's.Alarmed, I said that I didn't mean it that way - I just didn't have the cash for it. She then scoffed, saying - \"Who's fault is that?\"Although I was trying to keep in my anger, those words really pissed me off, so I told her \"You were the one who lied that I didn't need to pay anything!\"Getting angry as well, she replied: \"What I meant was there is no attendance fee! You literally assumed that you'd get a free five-course dinner. Wow, you're cheaper than I thought!\" With a glare, she asked me to leave her wedding. I did, struckdumb and rather hurt.(...And on my way home, I grabbed a Big Mac lol)Back at home, I told my boyfriend everything and asked if I was an asshole. He thought it was a funny story but said I was an AH - if I didn't have the money I could always pay her back later. In his exact words, he said \"You chose the wrong time to be stingy\".My other friends agree as well, saying that it was not tactful of me for doing that at the wedding - and although she lied, I should have just brushed it off instead of dampening her happy spirits.After hearing their opinions, I felt quite guilty and embarrassed. However, that one little part of me still thinks that it's justified because 1) she lied to me, and 2) publicly humiliated me.Please help me out. AITA?",

	"body" : "I don't like the operating room and, at some point of my life, hospital. When my ex-wife had her c-section, she had a complication and hovered between life and death for a long time. It was a horrible experience to feel so helpless.Currently, I deal with this in therapy, several things have improved, but going into an operating room is a big no-no for me. When my ex had our second child, I was very nervous and she asked me to wait outside the operating room.When my current wife and I decided to try to have children, I made it very clear that I didn't care what her choice of delivery was, but c-section I would not enter, but that I would stay by her side at all times except for operation. She agreed and eventually became pregnant.She decided in the middle of the pregnancy that it would be a c-section and I said that was fine, but I remembered my limitation. She understood and invited her mother to take my place.On the day of the surgery, before she had an c-section, she asked me to come in with her, because she wanted a moment of our own.I apologized, but that this was my limit and that I couldn't. She said \"Fine, I'll go with my mother then\" and had a crying face. I tried talking to her but to no avail and my MIL kept looking at me disguting.Anyway, I don't think it would have been a hell, because I was very nervous and it definitely wouldn't have helped at all inside the operating room.Everything went well and our daughter was born beautiful and healthy. I was already at the exit of the operating room waiting for them and I didn't leave their side.Later, when we were alone, my wife said that I abandoned her at a vulnerable time and left her alone when she needed me most. I tried talking to her, but she said that now we need to focus on our daughter, but that she was disappointed in me as a partner.Apparently my MIL told family members what I did and I'm being criticized.My wife and I have only talked about the baby and this has been going on for a week now.AITA?Extra: In the case of my ex, it was a c-section in parts mandatory (the first no, the second yes) and my wife's elective.

However, even after I stopped being friends with her, she continued to make up lies about me and made my life hell right up until we graduated. We went to different universities and I’m in my mid-twenties now.My older brother Carter went to the same university as Annika. Recently, he announced that he had gotten engaged to his girlfriend. Our family was happy for him, but we were surprised at the same time since we didn’t know he was dating anyone. He said he’d introduce her at an upcoming family party.The party rolled around and guess who walked in the door with Carter? Annika. I honestly thought I was hallucinating, and I felt sick seeing her again. Carter left Annika with some relatives, then came over to me and asked to talk.We went to another room and Carter explained he’d met Annika at a party and didn’t recognize her, but it was “love at first sight.” But after he found out her full name, he realized it was the same Annika who spread lies about me. He confronted her and she claimed to not remember me or anything she did. He let it go because he really liked her. He then pleaded with me to be nice to her since she “didn’t remember” what she had done and that she was a good person. I just told him I needed a moment to myself to process everything.When I eventually went back to the party, I decided I would ignore her. I didn’t say anything rude, I just didn’t talk to her or acknowledge her. She didn’t talk to me or acknowledge me either. But when we sat down to eat, all hell broke loose. One of my aunts asked me how I felt about my brother getting married. I tried changing the subject, but she kept pressing, so I eventually snapped and said something like: “I actually don’t feel great about it considering his future wife bullied me and never apologized.” Everyone turned to look at Annika. She just started crying and ran out of the room. Carter went after her, and they left early. The rest of the night was chaotic because everyone was asking me what happened (I told them).Later, Carter called me and said I was a horrible person for embarrassing Annika in front of the whole family and I was being petty over “high school drama.” He demanded I apologize to her. I refused and said HE was the awful one for blindsiding me with this, and that if she never bothered to reach out and apologize for what she did while they were dating, I wasn’t going to let it go now that they were engaged. He kept insisting that she didn’t remember, and she can’t apologize for something she doesn’t remember, but I think that’s bullshit. I ended up hanging up on him.The way I see it, I was asked a direct question and I provided a direct answer. Also, I don’t think I have any obligation to cover for her when she made my life hell, especially when she’s obviously lying about not remembering.

You could only bring 1 guest and you had to socially distance again.Her medical school decided to invite the pandemic graduates to this years graduation event. They planned this all out pretty last minute, only giving 3 weeks notice that it was happening. But my wife was very excited about it. She gets paid crumbs and works long hours as a resident, so I get why she wanted to relax and have fun.The issue is that I had a huge work trip the next day, that had been planned for months. I don't travel a lot for work so they went all out to make this comfortable, and I had a lot riding on it (if I didn't do well I would probably be fired, but if I did well there were 2 open positions I could be promoted to). My wife wanted to come with me, so my company comp'd her flight and we were going to make a vacation out of it after my presentations. We were flying out the night of the party to ensure I made it on time for the meetings the next day. I told my wife we shouldn't go to the re-do event since we had to fly out and it would be very tight.She insisted we go, since the party started at 3pm and our flight left at 9pm. But the gala was 1.5 hours away from the airport. We made a plan to leave at 5:30pm, pack everything in our car beforehand, so we could go straight to the airport.But by 530 she just started saying goodbye. I told her we needed to leave ASAP but she said no, we don't have to be 2 hours early for our flight, etc. Around 6pm this guy from med school (who had a crush and asked her out multiple times) grabbed her hand and pulled her to another table. I went up to them and told him he needed to back off. He said I needed to treat her better and let her 'enjoy herself'. I looked at my wife, but she ignored me.At that point I decided I wasn't going to try and convince her to stick to her word anymore. I told her I was leaving for the airport and took our car. There was a ton of traffic and security was a mess, so I only had a few minutes to spare before getting on the plane.She texted me horrible things. I never responded/engaged.  But she kept texting me how I was horrible and don't understand what it's like to have COVID ruin a huge moment for you. I disagree...she still had a graduation party, it's not my fault she didn't get to dance? I don't see what the huge deal was and conversely think she didn't understand that this would cost me my job if I missed the flight. And since I make up around 70% of our income in a HCOL area, we would essentially be homeless.We've been on tense terms since this happened in June. She brings it up a lot and is recommending therapy so I can \"learn how to behave in a marriage\", but I don't think we need it since she's the one who caused this whole problem in the first place and should take accountability for that first.But am I way off here?

By the way I’m the only girl my parents had and all of my brothers are 1 year younger than me, they were triplets. I’ve always been the one to be a second mom to my brothers because whenever our parents couldn’t get it I would. One of my brothers had found a wife and they’ve had a baby girl. I am very close to my brother and his wife and even his wife was excited to have me as the babies aunt. I love this baby with all of my heart being that this is my first niece and I plan on spoiling her because I’m financially stable and even though I’m not wealthy I still have a good amount of spending money. I also had a miscarriage about 2 years ago that was really hard on me so having a baby that I would be close with was extremely emotional and exciting for me. On the other hand my brother is not, he’s very traditional and wants to be the breadwinner/ provider of his family. He and his wife want to have a baby shower but it would mean they would loose a great sum of money they can’t afford. I’ve offered to pay for the whole thing because I love them and the baby, plus it would be a beautiful moment for both sides of their family. My husband and I coordinated with them and payed for anything they wanted for the baby shower. A few weeks before the baby shower my brother, his wife, my husband, and my other brothers were at our parents house for a football game. The topic of babies and the baby shower they planned came up and my brother made a joke saying “ I’m glad my wife is in working condition so we could be the first ones to have a baby, it feels good to be the first sibling for something.” That really hurt because I was so excited to be having a baby but when me and my husband got the news it devastated us and it took us a while to become better. I went home crying and I blocked my brother on everything. I couldn’t believe how inconsiderate and insensitive he was especially after I gave him everything. I texted him one time saying “We won’t be paying for your baby shower anymore, what you did was horrible and I don’t want to speak to you again.” He told our family and now they’re all trying to contact me but I don’t want to hear it. So Reddit am I the asshole?UpdateIve been reading a lot of the comments and I would like to thank everyone who gave their support and opinion. I will be answering some common questions I’ve been hearingWhat was the S. I. L. and families reaction? Everyone did not agree with this comment and the sister in law was pissed he even said something so rude. She texted me how sorry she was in his behalf and she says she totally understands why I made my decision.Did he apologize? He believes he did nothing wrong so he’s standing on his action. While I am upset by his blindness to how this could be hurtful I’m not the kind to argue until I get an apology.I have made the decision to try to still give my sister in law a baby shower because she deserves it. I don’t want to ruin my relationship with her or my niece so I’m trying to figure out a way to give her a baby shower and still hold my grounds with my brother. If you have any suggestions please let me know!FINAL UPDATE!!I took a lot of the suggestions I got and decided to host an all women’s baby shower! My husband wasn’t allowed to go either to make it fair, and of course the men in my family were upset by this but they understood where I was coming from. As for my brother that made the comment he was tough to deal with at first, but he hosted an all men’s party of his own. I’m so sorry for the late update, thank you all for the support and help!

They have been together for less than a year, but she is due in July. Obviously I know that things happen, so we are doing our best to embrace it. I’m excited to meet this new little person.Anyways, Kate’s family is uninvolved – they honestly weren’t great parents to begin with, but when they found out they kicked their pregnant 17 year old to the streets. My son and her were living with me until 2 weeks ago when they got their first apartment – I am extremely proud of them. We had a room set up for the baby, but since they got their own place, I let them take all the baby items I purchased. I mean a fully furnished nursery, and then of course everything from the shower – that baby isn’t going to be wanting for much.Well, the baby is breech. They have tried everything to get that baby to turn, but nothing! So, they have an C-section scheduled for July 3rd assuming the baby doesn’t flip\she goes into labor. I requested this day off of work, and then asked my son and Kate  if they would like me to pick them up or if they planned to have my son drive them. My son was confused and told me that he would drive them, why would I drive them? I told him I was just offering, and told him I’d be in the waiting room waiting for her to get out of surgery. Then Kate jumped in and said they weren’t having any visitors at the hospital. She said she needed time to heal, and they wanted to bond with the baby. She said it would just be the two of them and her sister.I’ll admit I was pretty taken aback – I mean, I feel like as the grandparent I’m closer then the aunt – but whatever. I said okay because I didn’t want to fight, and said I would be waiting at their house. Kate jumped back in and said the only visitor they would be having was her older sister. She said she would be in pain, bleeding, and trying to breastfeed, and that she wanted privacy to do that. She also said that I never got my TDAP booster (which I don’t need as I had it maybe 5 years ago when I had to go to the ER for a cut), so I couldn’t come until the baby had its first shots or I got the shot. I pointed out to her if she didn’t have a vaginal birth that she wouldn’t be bleeding and it would just be a surgery recovery and she could stay in the bedroom and relax and my son could bring her the baby when its hungry. She told me that ‘nobody was taking her newborn from her’. Lots of other things were said, and I feel extremely taken advantage of. I sheltered and provided for her and my son and I didn’t have to  - plus I gifted them a lot. I now see a lot of other narc tendencies from her, and I feel like its WWIII with my poor boy caught in the middle.I don’t feel like an asshole, but she and my son are saying I am.

	"title" : "AITA for wearing my wedding dress to someone else’s wedding?",
	"body" : "Please read the whole story before jumping to conclusions.I (20F) married my husband two years ago. We aren’t rich and don’t care that much about weddings, so I wore my prom dress to my wedding. It’s not a super fancy dress or anything, it’s basically a long sequin dress in deep dark blue with one sleeve. For the reference, the dress . My friend Ciara (22F) was attending my wedding. Since the wedding, I wore it on a few occasions because it’s basically the only one fancy dress I own.Recently, Ciara was getting married and I was obviously invited. The wedding color scheme was dark blue and she requested fancy attire, so I thought my dark blue dress would be fine. It’s not white and it’s not even remotely close to a wedding dress. I also didn’t feel like wasting money on another fancy dress that I wouldn’t ever wear again, especially since we aren’t rich.So I showed up at her wedding in my dark blue sequin dress. It wasn’t standing out or anything, most of the guests were wearing even more fancier dresses. However, when Ciara saw me, she lost it.She yelled at me in front of all the guests, in front of her husband and my husband, saying that what I did was horrible and that no one shows up at a wedding in a wedding dress. I tried to reason with her, saying that the dress isn’t a wedding dress, it’s the only fancy piece of clothing I own, I wore it to multiple occasions before and after my wedding. She didn’t listen and kept yelling at me to the point her bridesmaids and her husband started trying to calm her down. She also said a bunch of unsavoury names to me.I was very upset with the drama and decided to leave with my husband. Then I started getting texts from Ciara, who blamed me for upstaging her on her wedding day, for driving a wedge between her and her husband since he said that she overreacted massively and upset her friend over a dress. I decided to ignore them because I think she is being unreasonable, but a part of me thinks that I was an AH because I wore the dress to my own wedding.",

Lucas told me that his friend was mad that I didn’t agree. I just wanted the wedding to be about us because it was our special day. After that disagreement I thought nothing of it.Fast forward to my wedding day. We had finished the church service and now we’re at the reception were all having fun eating. I’m eating my food and then Jacob stops the music at the DJ booth to make an announcement. I just knew from that moment he was going to propose. I look to see where Lucas was and he was holding red and white roses walking out to stand in front of Chloe(Jacob’s girlfriend)spelling out. “Will you marry me?”I was shocked that they went behind my back when I said no. I got up out of seat and walked out. It’s been 2 days since the wedding and my husband cursed me out for not letting them have a special moment. I responded with “I wanted the day to be about us because it’s our wedding not theirs and I am happy for them but the worst thing was even though I said no you went behind my back about it.”Since that argument he moved to the guest bedroom and now most of my friends are cursing me out on all my socials.

	"body" : "My (F25) (step)brother Nico (29) has recently got engaged to a woman called Jenny after dating for two years. We all tried to welcome Jenny, especially knowing that she grew up in the foster care system and didn’t have family. We tried to get to know her, but she seemed to want an instant intimate connection rather than building one. Me and my younger (step) sister Chelsea (22) bore the brunt of her neediness but our parents have also expressed concerns.Since she met us she has been trying to insert herself into pictures, family disputes, and social events. She has no boundaries. We’ve all talked to Nico about it so many times, even sitting him down as a family and he keeps saying he will talk to her but nothing changes, and it’s got worse since the engagement. She tried to make me her Maid of Honour, demanded my mother throw her a bridal shower, started calling my parents Mom and Dad even though they asked her not to, and reached out to distant family members that we don’t even talk to to tell them about the engagement.Last week we were all (Chelsea, Nico, me, and our partners) staying at our parents’ place. Jenny, Nico, and my bf were the only ones not up yet and the rest of us were in the kitchen. Chelsea, my mum, and I were talking about taking a weekend trip. Jenny came in, having overheard us, saying it sounded like fun and proceeded to invite herself along. I was pretty annoyed by this and said she couldn’t just invite herself. Jenny said why wouldn’t she be invited, and I said because marrying Nico doesn’t give you a blanket invite to every single thing all his family does. Jenny got upset and said she would really like to be included in our family, since it was the only one she knows and she doesn’t have a proper family. I said I know that and we all sympathise but that doesn’t mean we owe you a new one.The whole room was silent and Jenny got up and went back upstairs. She didn’t come out the rest of the day but Nico came down to chew me out over what I said. Our parents defended me saying he had an opportunity to talk to Jenny and he didn’t. He and Jenny left the same day and he’s now only keeping low level contact with everyone.When I’ve spoken to him since he’s just said I went way too low with what I said to Jenny and that I’ve set her back mentally and that she’s really down. I do feel bad, but I also feel like Jenny has been overstepping. We are all open to a relationship with her (we all have good relationships with partners in the family) but she never really made a genuine effort to build relationships with us, she just decided she was entitled to them, which I think isn’t fair.I don’t know if I should reach out to Nico or Jenny with a more fervent apology, which I will if I have really screwed up here. I don’t want to be the reason Nico stops talking to us. I just feel like he dropped the ball by letting it get to this point.Edit - okay I’m adding this because I thought it was implied but maybe not. We do push back when Jenny is being intrusive. I can’t count how many times I have said “Jenny I’m not comfortable talking about my sex life/therapy/medication etc., it’s really personal, can we just change the subject”. We move on from the conversation but the next time I talk to her it’s back to square one. Same with my parents, they politely ask her not to call them mom and dad, and she stops for the duration of that conversation, and then starts again next time. We’ve never had a more in depth conversation with her, we offered, and Nico said no, he would talk to her.Edit 2: for everyone saying I should consider Jenny family because she’s engaged to Nico, that isn’t what I meant with that comment. I commented this elsewhere but I’m copying because it encapsulates when I was trying to get across.I never said or meant that she isn’t part of the family. I guess what I meant with what I said was, you can’t parachute yourself in and expect us to be the family you deserve. Because the family every person deserves is one with their mom and their dad and it’s happy and it’s from birth, and you don’t have do anything to earn it. Sadly, not everyone gets that. I know I didn’t. And I know how much it must suck for her to feel like she has to work for what other people got for free. I have a shitty bio dad, so I kind of know. You think “why do I have to be good and clever and kind and a million other things to have a good family while all anyone else has to do is just be born”, and it’s the worst. But when you come into a family that already exists that’s the way it is. They learn to love you and it takes time. My stepdad didn’t love me the second he met me, or love me just because he loved my mom, he got to know me, and figured out who I was as a person and he loved me for me. We wanted to have that opportunity with Jenny. And maybe that doesn’t feel good enough for her and I guess it’s not really fair that she doesn’t have the other kind of unconditional love but I don’t think that’s up to us, or anyone, to fix. That’s just my view.",

I said I was trying to lose a few pounds and she immediately assured me I was beautiful the way I was and I didn’t need to lose weight. I told her I know I am but losing weight helps with my mobility. She began “diagnosing” me with an eating disorder. Saying I must have a delusion I was very heavy and having issues walking. I was pissed and she sounded super condescending and blurted out she had no business talking down to me about my weight even if it was to tell me not to change it. The other people overheard and the gf got really embarrassed and left with my friend soon after. My bf thinks I should have explained why I need to keep my weight the same but I don’t think I should have to pull out my disability to get her to shut up.With long loose pants it’s often hard to tell I have a prosthetic leg.

Also, it's going to be a bit vague (I don't know if I can get in legal trouble), and even more background heavy.My(28F) life, and my parents's marriage, was ruined because of an MLM.What happened was, my mother joined a supplement MLM, got way into it, drained both my and my brother's(33M) college funds, and went into tens of thousands of dollars of debt, to maintain her rank.When my father was injured and had to take some time off work, the house of cards she built came tumbling down.We went from a loving home with two parents, a nice house in the suburbs, and at least 20k in a college fund; to our parents divorcing because she refused to leave the MLM, having to live in a crappy basement in our grandparents's house, and facing the reality of taking student loans if we want to go to college, as well as having to work as young teens, to help provide for our family of three. So, suffice to say, I hate MLMs with a passion.Now to the situation, my brother is marrying his fiancee(29F) of 4 years in 2 weeks. Last Saturday, I was invited to her bachelorette party. She said that she wanted a low key night at her home, with some food, some alcohol and some fun games.I get there, and including her, there are 14 other women. 3 of them are my cousins, who are 19 and 18.After I arrived (I was the last one there because I live 3 hours away), one of the women stood up and said that the fun can now begin.Then, she dragged a chest of sex toys, and started pitching us her MLM. From the get go, she said that my SIL agreed to host, and at the end of the night, depending on how much we got, she will get some money to help with her honeymoon.I was fuming, she knew how much both I and my brother hated MLMs, so I just stood to leave. Then I told my cousins to grab their bags and follow me. They tried to stop me (SIL and MLM hun), but I just said that we had to leave. But then, I couldn't just leave the other women to be preyed on. So I went on a rant about MLMs, how scammy they are, how I bet after plying them with alcohol, they will be pressured into buying stuff they didn't want, as well as into joining this pyramid scheme.My SIL was teary by then, screaming at me to just leave, and that I ruined her bachelorette party.I grabbed my cousins and left. And while I felt a bit bad about ruining her night, I did not feel bad about standing to a scammer at all.My brother says that while he completely understands where I come from, and that he had a really big fight with her, I should've just left with my cousins, without ruining the night altogether.So AITA?",

I felt especially guilty because I recently had found out I was pregnant as well, but had opted to wait to tell anyone.I felt guilty, so I elected to keep quiet about it for as long as I could, as I didn’t want to take any attention away from her grief or cause her any pain. This became a problem when my family arranged a little get together at her place to help her feel better, where alcohol was to be involved.The night was going fine, and my sister really seemed to be smiling and enjoying herself.

Most were believing my lies except my sisters friend, Ash, who came up to me and asked “Are you pregnant or something? Why aren’t you drinking?”I laughed and said I had to watch out for my health and, trying to change the subject. My sister saw us talking however, and came up with a shot in her hand. She basically said that she was really glad I was here and wanted to take a shot with me. I had a feeling that Ash had told her I wasn’t drinking and had come to confirm her suspicions…I turned her down and said that I was just happy to be in the moment with her. Lia got this teary look on her face and kinda eyed my stomach. She set the drink down and asked me slowly if I was pregnant and trying to hide it.I froze in the moment, which must’ve basically confirmed what she was suspecting. She burst into tears and asked again, much louder this time which caused most of the people in her apartment to look at us. She told me to either drink the shot or tell her the truth. I wasn’t sure what to do so I opted to just tell her the truth. I tried to tell her that I didn’t really want to take any attention away from her pain but she wasn’t listening. She started accusing me of coming to her apartment to “boast about my pregnancy” and how I always got what I wanted. She also said that shouldn’t have come to the party knowing that I couldn’t drink and that I obviously knew that people were going to know I was pregnant. Basically going on about how I was attention seeking. At this point our dad stepped in to calm her down cause she was belligerent at this point. At that point me and my boyfriend decided it was better for us to just leave. I even got a few quiet “congrats”, which I felt awful about.She’s not really talking to me right now, which I kind of understand but at the same time all I really wanted was to be there for her? People are more so leaning in her side because she’s going through a hard time right now but I feel like I’m not being listened to. My mom told me that she understands but that it was wrong of me to come knowing I was pregnant.Edit: I know you guys may find it strange we partied after her miscarriage so soon, that’s just how my family is.

Dad's wife, Rose, has a daughter who's like 11 now. They also have a 4 and 2 year old together. About a week after their wedding, my siblings snuck into my room in the middle of the night, sad about dad being married and the changes that had happened. They asked if I felt like mom really gone now and I said yeah. I asked them if they'd like for us to have something just for us, no new family involved, where we could remember mom and talk about that stuff. They said yes. So I raised the money to buy a pretty nice scrapbook and about once a month my siblings would sneak into my room at night and we'd put photos in and write memories we had and I'd share the stories I remembered of mom, since as the oldest I remembered her best and remembered the stories about her I'd heard. We never added Rose, our stepsister or our half siblings when they were born. We also didn't talk about it to dad or anyone else. I knew he wouldn't love that we were doing it. I kept it hidden in my room.Three weeks ago my Rose went through my stuff and found it. She claims she was cleaning up in my room but I know she was snooping because I had it hidden in a place that she wouldn't be cleaning. She went through it, showed my dad, and they sat my siblings and I down and told us that was a really unfair thing to have in the house and how mean it was to do something like that without all the siblings involved. My brother said it was just for the three of us as real siblings. Dad told him that was a shitty attitude and what are our stepsister and half siblings if not real siblings. My sister said it would always be different. Rose said we should never have made something in the home we all shared when it excluded three of our siblings and would hurt feelings. She said we should have done something to bring us all together. My sister said that wasn't what she wanted. My dad sent them out of the room and he and Rose told me I never should have gone along with it and how much it hurt my stepsister when she saw the book and heard what we'd been doing. Rose said it hurt her too. That she tried to make us all one family and we made sure never to close that divide in the last six years.

She looked taken aback but said that she told my son to watch the girls while she went to get food but when she came back he wasn’t there and the girls were alone.My son insists that he said he was busy but my sister insists that he didn’t.They went back and forth on this without letting me get a word in and I eventually just told my sister that this wasn’t working out and that if she was going to fight and argue with my son and mock him then she isn’t welcome in my home.She looked shocked and said that I need to stop coddling my son and stop feeding into his ridiculous delusions. I just told her to pack her shit. She said that her daughters will remember this and that I shouldn’t be surprised when no one wants the weird side of the family (meaning my son and I) around anymore. I feel bad because her daughters looked genuinely upset and I mean my son could by lying as well. And idk maybe his love for the water isn’t healthy but that’s never crossed my mind before. AITA?Edit:I suppose the mocking doesn’t make sense without context. My child’s father left us. When my son was younger, my brother got him into the Percy Jackson books and my son got pretty attached to the character and would tell people that he was the character and would say that his dad was similar to Poseidon which is why he wasn’t around. I haven’t read the books so I don’t know the details but it was for a very short while when he was a lot younger. He hasn’t even mentioned Percy Jackson in years.And to be fair to my sister, she texted me before leaving the girls and made sure I’d be there soon. I doubt she would’ve left if I wasn’t nearby.",

She graduated top of our class and went to a T20 law school. While she was in law school, I had a lot of trouble finding a job in my field or a job at all, really. I ended up working in a kitchen as a line cook to help support us (in addition to loans she took out) while she was going to school so she could just focus on her classes.Bella got a very good job in a different state after she graduated, so I quit my job and haven't gotten another one since. We have no kids, a nice house for the two of us, and are overall living very very comfortably. She works very long hours, so I take care of most of the household things. Cleaning, cooking, grocery shopping, re-painting the walls and doing other work and renovations to the house.In the last 6 months Bella's started referring to me as her \"house husband\" around our family and friends. I've mostly been letting it go but every single time it bothers me. I'm already insecure about not being able to find a good job and it makes me feel even more inadequate. I finally got to the end of my rope when we were with her mother on Sunday, who still doesn't really approve of me, and they were talking about taking care of the lawn/garden and she said, \"Thank goodness I have a house husband for that or I'd never find the time\" and smiled at me. Then they both laughed. It was humiliating.I didn't say anything at first but I guess she could tell that I was really upset and asked what was wrong. I told her that she needed to stop emasculating me and making it seem like I didn't contribute anything to the household. We were arguing back and forth and she told me that she would stop calling me a house husband if I was going to \"get that upset about it\" but that it wasn't an untrue term and I needed to stop being insecure.Bella refuses to apologize. I feel like she doesn't fully appreciate my value as her husband. I've stopped doing the chores until she apologizes and she is beyond pissed off. She's been coming home and cooking dinner (only for herself) and doing the chores I haven't and then taking off to spend the night at a friends house. I was talking to my sister about it and she told me that Bella was wrong but I was being immature in my response.

	"body" : "I (F25) have a half sister (F24), called ‘Hannah’. I suppose from our ages the circumstances of her birth are very obvious, and because of this and the subsequent drama, she was never in my life growing up. I would say I’ve met her less than 10 times in my life. When she was 16 she started consistently reaching out to me via social media but I was never interested. This stopped when we were about 20.Since then, I mostly forgot about about her existence until she reached out to me again at the start of this year, saying she’d got engaged. She wanted me to come to her engagement party and help her get in contact with the rest of my dad’s side of the family. I told her I wasn’t interested but I did ask the rest of the family (granddad, aunts, cousins) if they wanted me to put them in touch with her and they said no, so I told her that, too.About a week later I got a message on social media from her fiancé, digging me out for how I treated her. He told me he understood that it was tough being the product of an affair and he gets that I would be jealous of her since I was shunned by the family, but that she felt terrible about it and had always wanted a relationship with me. I was as confused as I was angry because he had the entire story arse backwards.I forwarded the messages to Hannah with a question mark and she admitted that her fiancé and his whole family don’t know that she is affair baby, that they think she stayed in contact with Dad’s family, that she went to the schools and university and basically lived the life I did. I didn’t blast her for the lies, I just told her that if I ever heard from any of the people in her life again, I would tell them the truth.The months went by. A few days ago, I received more messages, from the fiancé and the fiancé’s sister, calling me a heartless bitch for refusing Hannah’s attempts at contact. The sister said I needed to get over my jealousy of Hannah. The fiancé called me a spiteful witch for ‘emotionally blackmailing’ Hannah’s dad into not going to the wedding. It took everything in me not to reply and read the lot of them to filth.So, now I’m contemplating whether I would be the AH for messaging them back with the truth. It can’t go on like this, I told Hannah to handle her business and she didn’t. Also, her lies are pretty creepy. She’s marrying a guy who has no idea who she is. Then again, it’s not like she sent these people after me, so maybe I would be the AH for tearing apart her whole life over something that isn’t technically her fault.",

At first growing up I just thought it was because she's bad with time, but as I've gotten older I genuinely believe she likes making an entrance.I personally find it 1) rude and 2) embarrassing because it's not like it happens once in a while, it literally happens at every single function she is invited to that has a set time. Many family members have complained about this, nothing ever changes. It's gotten to the point that whenever my grandma has family lunches or dinners she'll tell me mom it starts an hour earlier that it actually does, so she'll be there on time. (My mom doesn't know that my grandma does this, it's a joke between grandma and I).This past weekend was my 22nd birthday. My grandma wanted to do a lunch for me at her place with our immediate family. The lunch was to start at 2pm, but we told my mom 1pm.I had plans later that evening to go out for dinner with my boyfriend, so I wanted to leave my grandma's house at around 5 the absolute latest because I needed to go home and get all ready.Well of course my mom was late. We called her at like 2:30PM to see where she was because you know, it's her daughters birthday. She had just left her house at 2:30PM and still had to pick up her bf on her way to my grandma's (30-35 mins away) so none of us were expecting her to arrive until like 3:30PM.She finally arrives 2 and a half hours late from the time we told her, makes her little entrance. We question her about. She tells us she thought the lunch started at 2? We asked her where she heard this from, she said my aunt (who was present at the lunch) told her.We questioned my aunt and she said she felt bad \"lying to my mom\".Everyone is pretty annoyed, but we all move on. Fast forward an hour later (4:30PM) I have to start leaving.My mom starts getting all annoyed with me that I'm leaving \"so soon\" and that she barely got to see me for my birthday. I told her that my life doesn't revolve around her, and that she should've been there sooner.She started giving me attitude and listing all these excuses as to why she's late. I couldn't be bothered to hear them and left.Later that night she messaged me saying that I was acting like an AH towards her and it was rude of me to lie to her about the time the lunch started. My mom and my aunt think I'm an AH for lying to her. My grandma doesn't think it's a big deal and they're overacting. I came here for some outside opinions.",

We had already set aside money for our wedding and since there was no longer going to be a lot of people coming we decided to splurge.So, we asked everyone who rsvp-ed that they were coming if they could take a few extra days off for a longer trip to Hawaii all expenses paid by us. Everyone said yes, so we started booking tickets and suites at this nice resort. We also planned some fun things to do while we're there. Everyone is very excited for the trip.Now my sister, who rsvp-ed that she and her family weren't coming, is upset that I didn't reinvite her when we changed plans. She thinks that since it's basically a different trip they should have been told. Originally she said she couldn't come to our wedding because that time of the year is very difficult for her and her husband because the summer is the busiest time for their business. They have a landscaping business. Also she said traveling that far with all her kids would be difficult because of the long car ride. It would have been around a 3 hour drive from where she lives. So it doesn't make any sense to me for her to say she can go on a longer trip even farther away. The plane trip is almost 9 hours long. Also she says it's unfair because our brother and his family gets to go while hers doesn't. That's making her kids feel left out because their cousins are going and my sister says it's like playing favorites.My sister and her family would be five more people so even if we wanted to reinvite them they would cause us to go way over budget. The only other option would be to drastically downgrade the trip we already promised everyone. it just seems totally unfair to everyone else, but my sister also thinks I'm being unfair and says we pulled a \"reverse bait and switch\".edit.

I noticed Alexis’s medicine box was moved so I looked at it and one of the blood thinner vials was a lot more empty than before and a needle/syringe was missing.Sister and I interrogated all of the kids and we found out Andrew gave himself a high dose of the blood thinner because he thought it was her pain meds and he wanted to get high.My sister rushed Andrew to the hospital and he stayed overnight.

To be able to come home and have everything exactly where I left it, to be able to play video games all day and have no one tell me otherwise, it feels like I am free and in control of my own life which is all I've always ever wanted.About a year ago my older brother (36M) and his wife (30f) asked to move in with me because while they can afford rent they do not want to pay $2000 a month for an apartment. While I did not want them here I reluctantly agreed because I can't tell my own brother that he can't live with me when I have 2 empty rooms in my house knowing he would let me live with him if I had ever asked and I was also fortunate enough to have family to live with while I was saving to buy my hosue. I do not charge them any rent or ask for anything, but they give me around $400 a month to help out.My brother and his wife had been trying to conceive a child for a long time and are finally successful in doing so. They are expecting in a few months. While I am extremely happy for them I also do not want them living with me. I did not buy my house for them, I bought it for me. I did not sign up for having my living room filled with baby toys and having my gaming room turned into a kid's bedroom. I did not sign up for my fridge being full of milk for a kid that isn't mine.This leads to today where I have asked them to move out before the birth of their child.

We both worked from home and our son was very colicky, i was exclusively breastfeeding and was up every night with him, doing all bed time feedings, nails clippings, teeth brushing, he did baths and diapers. It seemed like a fair arrangement. Eventually Covid ended and we got a nanny for Saturdays and our son started daycare he goes from 9-5, my husband started leaving for the day for work. I asked him to change the diapers when he was at home because our son who is in the 100th+ percentile in height and weight was hard to manage for me, i got by on days when i was alone but it was definitely difficult. Even when my mom would visit she would have hard time with the diaper changing and she works at a childcare facility because he was big and unruly. Now our son is 3 and almost fully potty trained, he wears a diaper over night. So we put a diaper on at night and take it off in the morning, and I’m pregnant again with really bad nausea so I’ve asked him to get the baby ready in the mornings as I’m usually choking back the vomit. My husband has decided he will not change any of the future babies diapers and has become very resentful saying that it was totally abusive and abnormal for him to change so many diapers through our sons life and that other dads don’t have to change so many diapers.

I always felt like our parenting duties were pretty evenly divided until i got pregnant 3 months ago and things have definitely been harder since then because it’s hard for me some days to do the things i used to do like make breakfast, get his daycare bag ready,physically pick him up.

	"body" : "I'm a 48-year-old man and my 19-year-old daughter has always been an independent thinker. I raised her to be independent and think for herself, which I've always appreciated. However, we recently hit a bit of a snag.She got engaged and decided that she doesn't want me to walk her down the aisle at her wedding. She argues that her mother and I don't \"own\" her, therefore we have no right to \"give her away\". I feel hurt by this because we never treated her like an object or piece of property, rather we've tried our best to provide her with a wonderful life.Her stance seems extreme to me and despite discussions, she's refusing to budge on the issue. I respect her choices, but I feel she's disregarding our feelings completely. As a response, I told her that if she feels that way, then I won't be paying for her wedding.I don't want to come across as controlling or manipulative. It's true, I don't \"own\" her, I also don't owe her a fully-funded wedding. She can pay for her own wedding if she's insistent on this stance.I'm feeling quite conflicted about this. AITA?Edit: So, this isn't about making the wedding about me. Walking her down the aisle (while all eyes are on her anyway) and then sitting down is hardly making the wedding about me. It's about her attitude. She's had every opportunity in life so far, and to exclude us from this day is a spit in the face. It's a rejection of everything we've done for her, sacrificed for her, given her. It's selfish.\"90% of wedding traditions and symbolism had roots in things we don't acknowledge today. Should we stop all of them? The rings, the flowers, the dress, the wedding party, the cake, the flower girls... a father walking his daughter down the aisle has been about respect, pride, love and honoring the father/daughter relationship for far longer than it was about ownership.\"Independent thinking does not mean rude or selfish thinking. Being an independent thinker does not give someone the license to disregard or disrespect the thoughts, feelings, or perspectives of others. Independent thinking is about maintaining the ability to think critically and form one's own opinions while remaining respectful and considerate of others. It is a balance between asserting individuality and engaging in meaningful and respectful interactions with others.Edit 2: Also note that our relationship is not so weak that this disagreement will \"ruin our relationship.\" We are still close with each other in spite of this. There is zero chance of her not inviting us to her wedding (regardless of who pays for it) or cutting off contact and withholding grandchildren. I feel sorry for anyone who suggests that as a possibility. Likewise, there is zero chance of us refusing to go to the wedding or cutting her out of the will. In life, people disagree - even strongly - it's a natural part of life. We don't end life-long relationships over it.UPDATE: For all the YTA people out there, I've decided to give my daughter a gift in the same amount as her older sister's wedding cost. She can use this for whatever she wants. For the NTA people out there, thanks, most of you get it. My daughter has also agreed to figure out a way to include us in a way that doesn't involve \"giving her away.\" We are still in the early wedding planning stages, and she is almost 20. So she will likely be 21 before the actual marriage. Thanks for the concern, I guess. I approve of the groom-to-be if that matters to anyone.We disagree, but that doesn't mean it's a relationship-ending event. My daughter is laughing hilariously at all of you that are saying she will disinvite us from the wedding or cut us off from grandkids. I just feel sorry for you all. THAT is petty and manipulative, and regardless of what you all say, I've raised her better than that.",

	"title" : "AITA for telling my sister it's her own fault she's alienated from the family?",
	"body" : "I am one of three siblings: 29F, 27F (me), and 22M.This all started about five years ago, when my older sister came to me and told me she was looking into our genealogy and wanted me to do one of those novelty genetics tests. I wasn't enthusiastic about it, but she was weirdly insistent, so I gave her the samples she asked for and moved on, not really giving it much more thought. At no point did I have a digital login for any results. I also never thought to mention this to my parents.A few months after this, Sister moved six hours away for another job and was noncommunicative. She would call Dad every once in a while, but Brother and I found that if we didn't call/text her first, we wouldn't hear from her, and she basically cut Mom off outright. When questioned about this, she would refuse to acknowledge that's what she was doing. Ultimately, we all just accepted it. Mom was totally baffled and broken hearted, and the rest of us naturally became less close with Sister as a result. Even she and Dad only talk a few times a year now, and none of us have seen her in person in five years.Earlier this year, Brother did 23AndMe and got weird results that led to hard conversations. Mom and Dad came clean that the three of us were donor conceived, a choice they made because Dad is infertile. They apologized for not telling us earlier, but Dad felt strongly about not telling us because he never wanted us to think of him as any less our dad.Dad called Sister and told her this too after we talked, and she basically had a breakdown on the phone. It turns out that she knew Dad wasn't her bio father, and firmly believed for five years that Mom had cheated on Dad and had been nursing intense resentments as a result.Apparently she did a genetics test five years ago and was puzzled that the ancestry info didn't match with what we knew about Dad's family. That's when she came to me to get a sample. She sent it to a lab with hers, and they confirmed the results were genetic half-siblings, with the same mother and different fathers. She drew her own conclusions from there (that dad was my bio-father and not hers, and that Mom had had an affair) and uprooted her life to get a fresh start.She's now furious about the situation and feels like she's been robbed of the last five years. When we last talked, I was maybe less sympathetic than I should have been and told her cutting us off with no explanation was an insane move, and if she'd told us even a fraction of what was going on, it could have been cleared up years ago. I acknowledged Mom and Dad messed up here by not being truthful about our genetic identities (which I'm also struggling with my own feelings on), but in the end, it was her decision to do this dramatic move and slow fade with zero explanation. I also expressed how hurt Brother and I had been to be left out of her life, and that it wasn't fair to punish us for what she thought had happened. AITA?",

We made sure to keep any bushes between us and them on our side of the property line.We were unaware that the elderly couple had sold the cottage to a relative of theirs and that he had planned to turn it into an Airbnb. We only know this now as after a summer of growth the owner had finally noticed the small \"hedge\" and realised what we'd done.He, and the couple, have sent official looking letters stating we are impeding their reasonable enjoyment of the property as they had planned to market the cottage as part of the property with \"views of a historical landmark\" and once our hedge is full height that view will be greatly diminished if not almost entirely gone.So AITA for potentially damaging someone's income by planting these hedges?",

We look for spiders, dig in the mud, and stop at our neighborhood park to play. It's sort of a standing meetup for a bunch of parents in the area.Recently a new family moved in the next block over. The mother mentioned that she had two boys too, Kyle (13M) and Aiden (7M). I told her about the Sat morning park group in case she wanted to meet some neighbors.When she showed up with Aiden it was clear he has special needs. The mom was friendly, she sat with all the parents while the kids played. Aiden is an enthusiastic player. Loud noises, banging on things, getting up in the other kids faces. The mom was good about correcting him, and he wasn't aggressive, just excited.The other kids are wary when he flails, but they include him in play still. One Sat he was having an especially tough day. I called Sam over for a snack. He said \"I don't want to play with Aiden, can we go home?\" So we left. The next day Aiden's mom came to my door. She told me that I should have talked to him about differently abled people instead of just abandoning her son. We agreed to talk to Sam.The next weekend Sam said hi to Aiden, they played together a bit, but when Aiden got loud again, Sam retreated to the highest platform where Aiden was scared to go. When Aiden asked him to be his partner for a game, Sam said no thank you. I felt that was fine. My wife still felt bad, so she invited them over.Aiden had one melt down but other than that it went fine. Afterwards Sam asked please could Aiden not come over again. I asked James what he thought of Kyle, he said that the kid was obnoxious and didn't smell great.The next weekend, Aiden destroyed my son's favorite toy. He snapped the arms and legs off. Sam yelled \"YOU ARE A VERY MEAN LITTLE BOY!\" I did not make him apologize, we just left.Now instead of going out in the morning, we go on Sat afternoon after Aiden has left the park.After a few weeks, some others started joining us. We didn't discuss why. But I suspect that they didn't all shift their weekend routine around solely because they missed my sparkling personality.Aiden's mom eventually got wind of it. I don't know how. She wrote us a long heartfelt letter. She felt I had not done enough to discourage Sam from ostracizing Aiden and that my \"pull\" in the neighborhood was influencing others to avoid her son now too.Sam has tried his best. He's verbalized his need for boundaries from Aiden to us three times now. James has also been clear that he doesn't like the brother, Kyle. As long as both of my kids treat them with respect, I'm satisfied.I can't control what the other parents choose to do.

	"body" : "I’m a single mom to 2 kids (8 & 6). I work as a nurse. 3 days a week, I work 12 hour shifts (12 pm-12 am). After my husband passed, I needed a nanny to tend to my kids from the time they got off school (3 pm) onwards. I decided a live-in was the best choice. I have one guest bedroom.I live right near a university. Around this time, my niece had just gotten accepted. She wanted to save cost on dorms and offered to watch my kids those 3 days, if she could live there rent free. I agreed, and said I’d also pay her $22/hr (a competitive rate for our area). She’s done with her classes by 1, so it works out. She fixes them dinner and puts them to bed. Then she’s free to do whatever. But of course I pay her from 3 pm-12:30 am. It worked for 2 years. My niece never had any complaints.Now, however, my niece is getting an (paid) internship related to her major that starts in January. She wouldn’t be available to watch my kids. I congratulated her and said I could help her look into student housing or an apartment. We’d have 3 months to do this. She was confused. I said since I would need a live in and only have one guest room, she would have to move out. My niece got upset and said this isn’t fair, she won’t be able to save any money if she gets a dorm or an apartment (she could afford to live on her own, but wouldn’t have much savings). I pointed out that this would work best for me as I had to put my kids in aftercare the other 2 days I work (I get off around 5) and the nanny could just pick them up from  school vs them having to stay there so long.My niece argued that the nanny could leave at the end of her shift but after speaking to some nannies, they understandably don’t want to drive home so late. Plus, I’m fine with the nanny (and my niece) sleeping after the kids do. So, there’s no sense in them sleeping then waking up and driving so drowsy. Even I feel nervous driving home so late, especially after my long shift.My SIL (her mom) feels this is unfair to my niece but she moved in under the condition that she’d work as a nanny. My SIL and brother live 3 hours away, so niece couldn’t commute if she moved back in with them. They feel I should try to find a nanny who’d be willing to drive home at 12:30 AM (it’d take me a half hour minimum to get home), but all nannies I’ve spoken to have said no or expressed concern about their safety driving so late.AITA?EDIT to answer from FAQ: The internship is all semester long. My niece isn’t interested in nannying at all going forward and will instead be pursuing internships. She has no desire to work after her internship is over for the day.She knew from the jump that I was only looking for a live in specifically for childcare.I have also provided her written notice and am covering my ass legally.",

The place is not the biggest, it's a one bed room apartment - but it is enough for one person and rent is very cheap so I'm extremely happy with it. I put a lot of work into it and made sure it's my little happy space.Recently my brother started staying over now and then, I don't have a problem with that, he works the nightshift and my place is also closer to his job than my parent's house. The problem began when he started brining more and more of his stuff to my place. He brought his PS4, started gaming in my living room and is overall just being a terribly inconsiderate guest and treats me like our mom.I brought this up with my parents and my dad suggested that I should let my brother live there and get myself a new apartment, he said I should look for a bigger place because my brother makes less money and he could afford my place and I could find something better. But I don't want a bigger apartment. I have no plans to have a family or partner where I would need anything more than one bed room. And I put so much work in to personalizing my apartment that this feels so unfair. My parents said I'd be an asshole for both, kicking my brother out now for staying over and not giving him the place.

We both feel like my brother is rushing into thing's and not being financially smart. He just finished his bachelor program a year ago, is still trying to get on his feet and find a good full time job in his field, and decides to spend thousands of dollars on a wedding?We sat him down and explained this to him and asked him what the rush was? Why not push it off for a few years and save up so you guys can really have the wedding of your dreams?He explained to us that his fiancée wants the wedding as soon as possible and doesn't want to wait.Well his fiancée's family is pitching in a couple thousand for the wedding, my dad reluctantly is pitching in a couple thousand as well (all important later).Well a few nights ago I'm eating dinner with my husband when I get a call from my future SIL.

We're also not even close at all and barely talk so like wtf?She starts begging and even starts CRYING and going on about how she can't afford one. I told her i'm sorry but no. She then starts going on about how I'm not even financially helping her and my brother pay for the wedding, so the least I can do is let her use my dress.I told her the honest truth, that I think they're rushing into having a wedding and not being financially smart. She said she didn't care, she has a timeline and wants to be married by 25.I basically said to her that she made her bed so now she has to lie in it, and figure it out herself, and if she can't afford her WEDDING DRESS then she should be having a wedding. Simple as that.She ran back to my mom and my brother to tell them what I said. They think I'm an AH because I have the money to financially help my brother and his fiancée, but I'm being \"selfish\" and \"unsupportive\".

Since then, dinners are ready on time, everyone praises and repeats the dish (not very common).It's 1-2 day for preparing meals. I don't ask them to help me, because I know I'm serious with organization, but if the person wants to, I ask them to respect the process.Another fact: my mother was a cook (for 1 year) and my SIL is studying gastronomy.The situation:Sunday was the half-yearly dinner and I was  the head as usual. Would help me: my SIL, mother, aunt and uncle. This would be SIL's first family dinner and she offered to help.During the preparation, my mother started to do several things wrong and every time I said something, she said something like \"Stay calm, a wrong thing will not lead to anything\".The problem is that she did so much wrong, skipping so many NECESSARY steps in the food that most things I had to redo or give a second look. She continued to help even though I said it wasn't necessary.I broke down when I just commented something about steps with my SIL and she corrected me, I was going to comment but my mother said \"I think you better cool off in the pool and let those with experience sort it out\".I accepted, grabbed a glass of wine, the spreassheet with me and spent the whole day in the pool, ignoring when asked to come back.So... Dinner was late, poorly seasoned, undercooked and no one had a second dish.My mother later said that I ruined dinner and humiliated our family in front of relatives in revenge. I shouldn't take that serious, because it was a silly family joke.Btw, I love making these dinners, and yes, my mother's SIL behavior is common.AITA?Someone asked for examples of what she did wrong: she put too much salt on one of the meats and it was inedible.

They never required her to go back to the office because her productivity actually increased so there was no need.  It made things easier for us too.  I dropped the kids off at school/daycare in the morning and she picked them up in the afternoon.  She was able to keep up with a few things around the house during the day, we saved on gas and car maintenance, etc.A few months ago, she was contacted by a recruiter about a job.  It would be a nice step up in her career path as well as a boost in pay.  But there were drawbacks.  The company had no WFH policy and would require her to work in the office.  This was apparently non-negotiable.  It would also be a 45-minute commute for her.We talked it over a lot and I expressed my concerns about how this would impact our daily lives.  I told her that I don't necessarily think that the bump in pay is worth the major changes to our daily lives.  Not to mention the stress that a long commute can have on people and that could impact their mood and how they interact at home.She assured me that everything would be fine and that we would adjust as a family and soon the new routine would just become our new normal.  I told her that I would never tell her NOT to take the job, but I just don't know if it is worth the changes that it is going to bring.  Ultimately, the decision was hers and she accepted the new job.  She's been there for about 10 weeks now.To say it has been an adjustment is an understatement.  She wakes up and leaves before the kids even get up.  She'll help get a few things ready for them before she goes, but the entire morning kid routine is on me.  I also do both drop-off and pick-up for all the kids too.  Evenings have been a huge mess because I get home and try to get the kids distracted while I start dinner.  When my wife gets home, she is usually stressed from the drive (her commute has turned into over an hour due to construction and traffic) and takes 15 minutes for herself to calm down before eating alone.  Then, after dinner she's going to bed earlier because she has to wake up earlier.I told her that I feel her new job has put an unfair amount of household and childcare duties on me and that she is being far less present in our lives when she's home.  She told me that we just need to give it more time to adjust and things will get easier.  I told her that 10-weeks is a pretty good adjustment period and I hate it so far.  She told me I'm being an unsupportive jerk and I need to give it more time.EDIT: I don't have the emotional bandwidth right now to deal with the huge amount of sexist BS I'm getting here.

My wife is a controller and I'm a pharmacist, together, we make a very, very comfortable living, but are not rich. So when my son was getting scholarship offers for basketball, I realized we could pay for my daughter's college in full and neither of them would have any student loan debt when they graduate. A plan that I shared with my daughter, which I think was a mistake to begin with.These plans changed when my son tried riding on someone else's motorcycle, with their permission, but with zero training, and got badly injured on a ensuing crash.

Recently he confided in me that the pills he's on have unfortunate side effects with his libido to virtually zero interest and wants to stop them. I told him the important thing is that he's with us, but he can bring that up with his doctor next visit.Fast forward about 2 weeks.I'm upstairs looking for something in my room and I heard my daughter talking to her friends on her phone about college. The conversation turned towards her brother and she said she \"can't wait to be gone, I'm tired hearing (her brother) cry every day\" and saying his hand is gross I knew \"spirits\" in the house has shifted since he became injured, but I didn't think she felt this type of way. I was gonna talk to her later about this, but then I heard her say \"I heard him say that he can't even get it up\" while laughing.At that, I was furious.I stormed in her room, took her phone, laptop, car keys and TV out of her room. I told her she should be ashamed of how she's talking about her brother and he might do something permanent if he heard you talking about him like that.When my wife got home, we talked about what happened and while she's proud of the way I stood up for my son, she thinks it's too far to also not pay for her college, since we could easily do so.WIBTA if I don't pay for my daughter's college?Edit: Fairly unanimous that this would be too far and I think I knew that, but I just can't calm down. Maybe I'm stunned that it was my own daughter saying it, but it's rare that I harbor something like this.Also, many comments hinting that I'm alienating or neglecting my daughter are completely unfounded. The post was about my son's condition, so I talked about my son. Maybe my daughter feels less important or neglected, I can understand that, but it certainly not because of a lack of attention or love.I accept it though, IWBTA.",

The kids went on the rides while my sister and I got coffee nearby. We told them to meet us at a certain table when they were done.My 8 year old came to me much earlier than her siblings/cousins. I asked if the rides scared her and she said no, she just skipped the lines. I asked for clarification and she said when there was extra space on the ride, they asked for single riders to come up to the front so she did that for all 5 rides.I told her the point of her going with her siblings and cousins is to have fun with them and that it was selfish for her to leave them so she could cut the line. I told her I understand why she doesn’t have many friends if this is how she acts all the time and she started to cry and ran to my sister.My sister ended up buying her ice cream and said that I was too harsh.

I met my wife through work, and I also met her father, who worked at the same company in a higher role than both of us. My wife knew I had a son, but I said I wouldn't introduce them unless we became a serious couple, because that wouldn't be fair to him.When my wife did meet my son, they got along really well. I invited her and her father over for dinner one night, and her father met my son for the first time. He was weird and awkward around my son and made strange comments about his appearance (his mom is black). I confronted him after the dinner, and he made some pretty pathetic excuses. After that I asked him to not contact me outside of work matters and asked her for space.A couple weeks later, my wife told me she had completely cut her father off for his beliefs. Our relationship became stronger than ever. When we got engaged she said she didn't want her father at the wedding. We ended up both transferring to other companies. As far as I knew he was gone from both of our lives for good.My wife is pregnant and due in a month. She has already started maternity leave and has been looking for a new job to start after maternity leave because she doesn't want to stay at her current company. Yesterday she sat me down and told me her dad got her an interview for a job at our old company. She also told me she has been talking to him for a couple months and wants to know how I would feel about him knowing our future child.I told her the truth. I told her I felt betrayed and I felt like she betrayed my son, who she claimed to think of as her son as well. I told her that she would even ask me that makes her less of a person in my eyes. She started crying and asked me what kind of insensitive jerk would call the woman pregnant with his kid less of a person. I told her that was how I felt, and although the language was harsh, I felt it matched what she was asking for.After cooling off, I'm now unsure if my word choice was warranted and wondering if I was an asshole for speaking to her that way while she is pregnant and more emotionally vulnerable. I could have just said I wasn't okay with what she was proposing without insulting her character.",

I figured he wouldn't have been a good dad just because of the type of dad he's been to me my whole life.Yesterday was my great grandma’s 100th birthday so we were doing a big party for her. A few days ago I found out from my grandma my dad is going to be there and more than likely with his kids. I was still going to go though because I've always been close to my great-grandma.About an hour of me being at this party my dad, his wife, and their 2 kids walk in. The kids were about 3 and 6 years old. I watched them off and on through the party... My dad was actually being a dad, he was playing with his kids and listening to them, even had cute nicknames for them.Then my dad came up to me and said pretty much “Uh... Hey (my name)... Um how have you... Been... It's..um been a while”. I will admit I was upset seeing my dad act like the person he never was to me and has never put in the effort. So I said I'm okay I then pointed over to his kids and said congrats on actually being a dad this time around. My dad got mad and said he's sorry but he can't change the past... But he never even puts up an effort now to call or text me or wants to come to visit me. I then had other family members tell me I need to grow up and get over it and now be happy for my dad.

This is mostly because of sensory issues, so certain noises or textures grate on me to an extent that I will leave the room or avoid touching things. I’m also just a picky person and I like things how I like them. So my stepdad started referring to me as the Princess, like “don’t open the car window, the Princess will get upset”. My stepbrothers and mum use it as well. It’s a running family joke, well meant, I’ve never been offended by it in the 15 years it’s been a thing. My stepsister, Georgia (F30) hates it. She used to snap whenever anyone said it but over the years she just started making the odd passive aggressive comment about it. Everyone ignores it, because Georgia has a habit of thinking everything is about her, and if it's not about her, the reason it's not about her is because we all hate her, which then is still about her.So, our whole family is visiting my parents in the countryside for a couple of weeks. Georgia has brought her boyfriend Jason along. I’ve met Jason a couple of times before at dinners and he’s a nice guy, and he’s fit in well.This morning, me and my mum were making breakfast and Jason came down and to help out. We normally have breakfast in the kitchen/diner so eventually everyone started gathering at the table. We always make the tea and coffee last so it’s hot when we eat and we had all the mugs out and Jason offered to make the drinks. I told him not to do mine because I liked it made a very particular way, and he said “okay Princess I will just watch how you do it so I know for next time” and we laughed. It. Was. A. Joke.The next thing we know, Georgia shouts she’s sick of everyone calling me. She then swore at Jason for being “just like them (us)”. She said since everyone thinks I’m so special what does that make her, and I replied “the ugly stepsister, obviously”. No one said anything, but Georgia burst into tears, pushed her plate onto the floor (broke it) and went upstairs, and Jason ran after her. He’s since come down to apologise for her, she hasn’t come out of her room.My stepbrothers are on my side, the parents say I should have just not said anything and she would have calmed down, and that I went too far picking at an insecurity. That might be true, but I’m sick of her making everything about her. The joke doesn’t have anything to do with her, and I am (as are my stepbrothers) sick of her acting out to force everyone to behave how she wants them to.Am I the AH for taking the argument there?",

	"title" : "AITA for refusing to change my daughter's clothes at a birthday party?",
	"body" : "I (34F) have two kids (8M & 4F). My daughter's name is Aurora. My husband (36M) and I chose that name because it was slightly similar to my late FIL's, and worked well with our last names. It had nothing to do with the princess from Sleeping Beauty. In spite of that, we've had fun with that movie in the past, and ever since my daughter realized that she shared names with a Disney character, Princess Aurora has been her favorite.Our family went to Disney World in July, and while there, we bought my daughter a Princess Aurora costume. She adores it, and wears it whenever she has the chance.Two weeks ago, one of Aurora's friends from school threw a princess-themed birthday party. She encouraged her friends to wear costumes. My daughter wanted to go as her favorite character, which didn't surprise me at all.When we got to the party, the birthday girl came to greet my daughter, and she was also dressed as Princess Aurora. I didn't know what her costume was going to be prior to the party.I got worried for a second, but the birthday girl was actually really excited. She said that they looked like twins. It was adorable. They ran off to play and I forgot about the costumes for a while.About 30 minutes into the party, I was at a table with some of the other moms when the birthday girl's mother came up to me. She asked if I had brought any spare clothes for Aurora. I said yes (I always bring an extra shirt and shorts for her). She then asked me to change my daughter into the spare clothes and out of her costume.The mother explained that she'd hired a photographer to walk around taking pictures of the kids, and was also planning on getting a group photo near the end of the party. She didn't want anyone wearing the same costume as her daughter in these pictures. She also thought her daughter might get jealous, since my kid gets to share her name with their favorite princess.Now, if the birthday girl was the one who had a problem, I might've considered changing Aurora into her spare clothes. But no, she was genuinely excited they were dressed the same. It also didn't feel fair to force my daughter to be the only one without a costume in a party full of children in princess dresses.I said no and explained my reasoning to the girl's mom. She insisted for a few minutes, but I held my ground. Some of the other moms started to back me up, and she eventually got up and left.When I went to pick up my kids earlier this week, I ran into her friend's mom. She accused me of ruining her daughter's party by allowing Aurora to wear the same costume as her. She told me she doesn't think she'll ever be able to look at the pictures without being disgusted by my behavior.I thought she was exaggerating, but I'm starting to doubt myself. Our conflict has found its way to the mom group chat we're both in, and opinions over there are divided. Some think having two girls wear the same costume is no big deal, others think I should have changed my daughter's clothes.AITA?",

	"body" : "My wife(25F) of 5 years has a sister(20F). She’s somewhat disabled, and while this may sound contradictory she has a condition which makes working difficult but not entirely impossible unless she is under stress (neurological condition, loses muscle control, makes her hit/throw stuff, fall over).I have no problem with her sister. She is sweet and nice to have around, my wife loves her more than anything. She basically raised her and stepped in when her parents wouldn’t or couldn’t. This has led to a relationship closer to mother daughter. My wife would constantly be paying for stuff for her sister, and this made sense to me when she was a minor and was doing much worse health wise.Recently though this has increasingly been getting under my skin. I am the sole provider for my household right now since my wife was pregnant, and only gave birth recently. We’d spend a lot to buy her sister gifts for holidays, which she would never return the favor - even with something cheap with thought (or no thought) put into them. We’d always take her out to events or dinner and pay for her every time. She would never even pick up the bill for herself.Again, wasn’t entirely an issue until she became an adult - and now I’m fed up with it. She expects my sister to do things like pay for her to go to the doctor, or invites us out to lunch and then expects us to pay. She doesn’t even schedule her own appointments, my wife takes her wherever she asks even if she has the ability to do it herself and we live 45 minutes away. She always talks about how she's freelancing and is making money, but then somehow has no money whenever she needs or wants anything.I did not have an issue with this either really. I thought my wife was being a pushover, but it's ultimately her money. Until recently. Now she's spending my money on her and it's really getting me angry. I want to spend my money on my daughter but we’re spending money on this financially irresponsible leech.I explained this to my wife in a much nicer way, but we ended up in a fight where I called her sister some pretty messed up things. I ended the conversation by telling her I would take away her access to our joint bank account until she contributes again if she doesn’t tell her sister to grow up and that she is not her mother, and she is no longer a child. She cannot be dependent on people forever. I think it’s an important lesson for her to learn. If she doesn’t learn it, she can get back to work and continue supporting her until shes 40 with her own money. Not mine.She honestly thinks this is an end of the world situation, I think it's quite clear this is for the better. I think she's scared of hurting her sister but at this point shes crippling her by allowing her to do nothing.EDIT : I should have worded it better in my post. I just meant having the debit card and using our money on her sister. Not taking away all her access to money but setting a limit, or giving her cash so she cant just get suckered into paying for stuff. A lot of the criticism still stands despite this but I want to clarify I'm not taking away her access to all the money entirely.I also understand the comments about my wife being a homemaker means she is putting in equal work so my money is her money, but we are on a single income and we can barely afford our familys needs. I cant give her half my salary so she can spend half of that on her sister. A majority of it goes to keeping us paycheck to paycheck right now.",

I can't help but wonder if I made a huge mistake, so I'm turning to you, Reddit, to pass judgment on whether or not I'm the asshole in this situation.Since my wife's passing, life has been tough for the both of us. Dealing with my own grief while trying to provide for her has been a challenge. My daughter has been extremely, extremely distraught; and I can see how much she's struggling emotionally. However, when she asked me for time off from school to process her grief, I ended up prioritizing her academic performance instead.I'll admit, I've always been a stickler for education, and my daughter is a bright student who excels in her studies (particularly math and science, which are very important and I wouldn’t want to jeopardize that). When she approached me, I couldn't help but think about how it would impact her grades and future prospects. I was concerned that missing school would lead to a drop in her academic performance and potentially hinder her chances of getting into a good college.Instead of allowing her to take some time off, I suggested that she continue attending school and told her that I believed that maintaining a routine and focusing on her education would provide stability and keep her on track.Apparently, my daughter was devastated by my decision. She accused me of not caring about her feelings and prioritizing her school performance over her emotional well-being. She believes that I'm being callous and unfeeling, dismissing her need for “time to heal”.Soooo, Reddit, am I the asshole for putting my daughter's school performance ahead of her “emotional well-being” (as she put it) after the death of her mother?

She was one of the popular kids and I wasn’t.A few years after college, I moved back home when my dad got sick. I found a job in my field about 45 minutes away from home. I would help take my dad to his chemo appointments. It was during one of those appointments I ran into EX.  She was now a worked at the hospital. One day while waiting, I asked her out.It turned out we shared a lot of the same interests. It seemed like our relationship was going great. About a year or so into dating EX and I moved into a rented house together. The following year, I proposed. We began looking for a house. EX always wanted to live in her grandparents’ house on the lake near our town. Her family was forced to sell house when her grandparents died because of an inheritance dispute. 6 months before our wedding, a chance event happened. The couple who bought her grandparents lake house had grown tired of our snowy winters. It took some work and nearly all of my savings, but I was able to buy her dream house. It was going to be my surprise wedding present so I didn’t dare tell her or anyone in her family my plans.A month before our wedding, EX and her friends went to Miami for her bachelorette party. I am not sure all of what happened there, part of me doesn’t really want to know, but I do know her high school BF was there. When she got back, from the trip, she broke down and confessed she was afraid to get married and wanted to call it off. It was a mess. She later moved to Florida and eventually married HS BF.I ended up moving back to the city for an amazing job. In the meantime, I still had the lake house. With the help of my mom and dad, we started to fix up the lake house. It took a few years. My mom and dad would look after the contractors while I was in the city. Having the house was perfect when the everything locked down. I was able to escape the city and work remotely from the lake house. I now live here full time and work remotely.This summer we had 4th of July at the Lake House. My SIL used photos from the lake this summer in her Christmas card. One of those cards made it to EX’s cousin. The cousin recognized the house. The Saturday before new year’s EX’s Mother and Sister were at my front door. After pleasantries and answering their initial questions, they made an offer to buy it. I refused. They were not happy.A few days I got a long txt from EX. This was the first time in about 9 years she has talked with me. She called me an ass for keeping this from her. Her family is blaming her for losing the house again. She then asked me sell. I still have no intention to sell. Now her and her family are complaining on social media that this is some sort of revenge. AITA?",

Before they moved in, we set some ground rules such as my BIL must be actively job searching and that they must RESPECT our space and clean up after themselves.Unfortunately, in the past month, they have began to slowly destroy my home and my space without giving two shits. First of all, my SIL is an extremely picky eater so their family doesn't eat with us. Fine.

When I tell them to clean after themselves, they begrudgingly do but it's never a job well done.

SIL is stay-at-home but she's more like stay-in-her-room, doing god knows what while her two children run rampant around my house.

I ended up calling my husband, explaining the situation, and told him that they would not stay another day in our house, no questions asked. Then I went around the house picking up their dirty clothes, toys, papers, etc. and threw them outside onto our lawn.When they came back, there was a huge confrontation between me and them. I listed all the disrespectful things they'd done and that because they'd met NONE of the conditions outlined when they first moved in, I wanted them off my property by midnight. I called their kids untrained dogs. They screamed back calling me heartless, cruel, evil, saying I'd make them homeless. Well they did end up leaving after I threatened to call the cops. Husband is fully on my side but I can tell he feels a little bad. MIL called me, upset, asking me to take them back in after I \"forced them to sleep in their car\" last night. AITA?",

But not too tired for Hawaii or Cancun?They always ask my parents and us to visit them during holidays she works so at least we can be together and she will join everyday after 5. But, it's hard for us to travel with a 1.5 year old. My parents have to split time visiting there and visiting us and we need them for childcare. I've been asking my brother and SIL to visit us more even though I know her schedule is busy and my brother got frustrated with me. When I asked him to visit alone, he said she needs him because the heavy workload has been really mentally straining on her and quoted how resident physicians have a really high depression rate and basically called me TA.I feel its unfair we have to visit all the time considering we have a 1 year old  and also both work FULL TIME and feel they should balance better to visit us rather than just vacation.

	"body" : "One of my (F24) friends,  Anna (F24) had a baby around 6 months back. Our friendgroup is otherwise childless.All of us used to hang out a lot before the baby was born. Baby changed dynamics because Anna wanted to bring the baby everywhere with her and its a baby. We tried to plan things around baby to include Anna but it always ended up badly. We shouldn't drink, cause Anna can't drink. We shouldn't be loud cause baby needs to sleep. Iceing on the cake is her baby is extremely fussy and cries all the time. It was just a downer for rest of us. So we started hanging out without Anna and her baby.Last weekend all of us went on a staycation. We had a great time and posted photos and videos on instagram. Anna saw these and called me to ask why I did not ask her to come with. I tried telling her it was a last minute plan and we could only find a childfree resort so as to not hurt her feelings. She called my bluff sending me pics some random family had posted with kids at the resort.She kept forcing me and I told her we did not want to hang out with her baby. She asked how can I say that about her baby.I asked her to leave it at that but she wouldn't. I finally told her its a baby and we are all young. We don't want to live our life around a baby she chose to have. That we get to do adult stuff and party all we wanted. Her baby is the only reason she wasn't invited. If she left baby at home she can come too.She got pissed off at me and called me a AH. She also sent a text in group chat saying she is disappointed in all of us for excluding her just because she is a mom.Half of our friendgroup thinks I should not have told her the real reason and is mad at me. Other half thinks she is unreasonable.AITA for telling her the truth?From comments : we have tried to communicate to her about adults only events before. Other than openly saying don't come if you have to bring your baby.She refuses to leave baby with her boyfriend or babysitter. Even when we say an event is adults only, like a dinner we had a few weeks ago, she still brought her baby. Baby cried throughout the night earning us glares and we had to leave early.",

	"body" : "My wife [34F] and I [47M] are staying with my parents [72F & 71M], grandma [90F], older brother [50M], brother-in-law [48M], their kids [10F & 7M], younger brother [40M], sister-in-law [38F], and their kids [9M, 7F, & 4M] at a beach house we rented for 2 weeks.I should preface this by saying that frankly, I do not get along with my younger brother (\"Tod\") and I do not like my sister-in-law (\"Anne\"). That said, I am civil with them and while I don't see them often, I do love my niece and nephews. Yesterday, my wife (\"Alice\") and I were babysitting all of our nieces and nephews while my grandma napped and everyone else went to see a movie.Now, once we got here, Alice and I had baked cookies for everyone to eat. We'd baked them later in the evening, and Anne (who works as a personal trainer) told her kids that they couldn't have any. The kids were upset, of course (especially since their cousins were allowed cookies), but Anne was insistent that they weren't allowed any at the time. She and Tod are generally quite strict with the kids' diets (none of them have any food allergies), and to my recollection they have only been allowed a popsicle once this past week. While everyone was out, one of the kids asked Alice if they could have cookies, and so we gave them all some cookies to enjoy.When everyone came home, Anne asked the kids what they did, and one of them mentioned that we gave them cookies. She then told them to play on the beach, where they were watched by my older brother and brother-in-law and were joined by their cousins.Anne then proceeded to get very mad. She started off just saying that we shouldn't have given them cookies because she hadn't said they could have them. Alice started to apologize and say we just wanted to let them enjoy their vacation, but Anne interrupted her and told her that \"she didn't trust a fat ass with [her kids'] health.\"Now, I was absolutely livid, and I told her to shut the fuck up. The argument spiraled from there, and at one point Anne said she should never have trusted two \"psychos\" with her kids (Alice and I met in a therapy group 11 years ago after we were discharged from the hospital for mental health concerns - though I'd like to emphasize we weren't there for anything that would ever even imply that we'd put anyone else in danger).I then told her that it was rich for two whores to think that they could ever raise morally-healthy kids (Anne was originally Tod's \"best friend's\" wife, but the two had an affair, during which their oldest child was conceived, then Anne and her husband had what sounds like a rather messy divorce).She then started crying and left, and our family is a bit divided over this.

Because of this, the last time I was able to send her to school was 2 years ago when we were able to do preschool 3 hours a day, 2 days a week, and they still wore masks. Now the only time she’s around other kids is when she’s in the hospital.Emi hates sharing her toys so I try not to make her do it.

It’s been difficult for everyone. At first I switched rooms with Emi and we put all 3 girls in the master but Emi hated sharing rooms and said the girls were always touching her stuff so we switched back and I put the girls in the spare room with their mom. My sister was complaining that the room was too crowded so she’s staying on a cot in my office but apparently that’s also uncomfortable so she wants the girls to share again. My sister does not pay any rent. Her husband sends $500 a month to help pay for their groceries and she helps with Emi while I’m working (my job is pretty flexible so I’m able to watch her while I work). They’ve also been complaining that I take Emi on day/weekend trips without them.Emi just spent the week in the hospital and we came home on Saturday. My nieces beds were moved into Emi’s room and her toys were everywhere. I confronted my sister and she said Emi isn’t using her room or her toys half the time and that little girls should be sharing with each other. I told her that Emi has already made it clear that she does not want to share her room or her toys, and that her room needs to be the way we left it by the end of the day.She says I’m being unfair so I snapped at her that I will be prioritizing my kid over her ungrateful self and her kids and that if she can’t get over my kid not sharing she needs to find somewhere else to live.They did fix Emi’s room but they haven’t been talking to us.

My parents watch movies with him and spend time with him and never invite me.A few days ago I got frustrated by the fact that I am feeling so left out and ignored that i told my mom about it. I told her i was feeling like a “glass child”. She called me disgusting and couldn’t believe that i was “jealous” of my brother with cancer. So, aita?EDITFor clarification, im not jealous that my brother has cancer. To be honest i’m not jealous at all; i simply used that word because it’s the word my mom used to describe me.I spend time with my brother. We recently went on an overseas trip just the two of us together. What i’m upset about is that my family doesn’t put much of an effort to check in on me or spend time with me.I understand that he has a limited time left and that they want to continue to spend time with him before he’s gone but still, don’t i deserve love too?UPDATEFirst off, I would like to thank everyone for reaching out. I truly appreciate all of the links to support groups and such. I have a long page in my notes app where I saved all the links lol. Also, all the happy birthday wishes were so kind. Thank you.as an additional update to my situation, yesterday, my dad reached out to have dinner with me. We went out to eat at a restaurant. The first think he started talking about was my brother. He didn’t ask me how I was doing, or what my current interests were or anything, just reminding me that he was going to die. I got really upset and left for a little while because, once again, i felt like i didn’t matter to my family.Later that day I called my mom and explained to her how i was feeling. She told me that she understood and was sorry that i was feeling that way. She said she would try to include me more. So, hopefully things will change and i won’t feel so neglected in the future.",

Not empty, but there were multiple unused seats and no one had to stand. I had just gone shopping and had heavy bags that were hard to carry and hardly fit in front of my legs.So I sat in one seat and placed my bags on the seat next to me, essentially taking up 2 seats on my own. Since it wasn't crowded when I got on I didn't see an issue and like I said the bags were super heavy and hurt to carry so I wanted to set them down.The bus ride was kind of long and as it went on more and more people got on the bus. It eventually got pretty crowded to the point where some people had to stand up.I didn't ever move my bag or offer the seat to someone. In my experience most people don't want to sit next to strangers anyway and a lot of the time people will end up standing instead of sitting in an empty seat next to someone they don't know. Also no one said anything to me.At the last stop (ended at the bus station where pretty much everyone was getting off) someone passive aggressively told me \"you could have moved your bag and not been inconsiderate and rude. Everyone wants to sit not just you.\" Or something along those lines. I didn't really respond because I didn't know what to say.The person who said that never asked me to move my stuff, and if they did I probably would have. So I don't understand how I was being rude? They could have asked during the ride instead of insulting me after it was already done. Busses are also generally first come first serve so I think my behavior was normal.AITA?",

I asked him where baby was and he replied that our daughter was watching him in her bedroom.Her bedroom is on the opposite side of the house, and with the tv blaring you could definitely NOT hear what was going on in her room. I pointed out to him how he yelled at me last week for the same thing and he replied \"That was different\" When asked how, he replied \"she wants to look after him, she came to ask me if she could\"I was so mad. I didn't leave them alone for prolonged periods of time, I was litterally in and out of the room during all of that time as I was cleaning up, but that was neglectful and dangerous because I asked her to watch baby. While at the same time it is perfectly ok for her to be left, completely alone, rooms away, with the tv on, because she asked to watch him so somehow that would mean that she pays closer attention to him? Like accidents Don't happen when you choose to look after a baby?He is now mad at me, saying I am overreacting and that I am still in the wrong while he is not.I accept that I was wrong in asking her to watch him, but am I wrong for being mad about the double standards???",

I knew we would likely have leftovers, so had arranged for them to be donated to the soup kitchen we sometimes work with, however, my mom went behind my back and took most of it with her. I didn't really know what happened to the food.Until now.My sister Callie (30f) got married over the long weekend.  She didn't want to mess with any of the planning and- knowing how my mom was during my wedding- decided to let our mom take over the whole thing.All we had to do was show up where we were told and party.The ceremony was beautiful, but it was when the buffet was revealed that I noticed something odd.The food looked eerily familiar. Like, identical to what I had for my wedding except for a little more dried out and sad.I found an opening and went to ask my mom about it where she happily told me she \"saved a fortune\" by unfreezing the food from my wedding to serve to the guests now. I was horrified and immediately voiced my concerns about safety. She got upset and said I was acting like a snob and should be happy the food wasn't going to waste. I argued that it was never going to be wasted, but she wouldn't hear it.I didn't want to make a scene, but was worried about people getting sick so snuck off to see my sister. She was horribly embarrassed- mentioned that mom said something about saving money but didn't question it because she didn't want to foot the bill like I had. She told me not to eat the food and thanked me for the warning.From there, my husband and I discretely started telling some guests to be weary of the food and the rest of the night was fine.My mom caught some flack for being cheap, but I've also been catching heat. Some of our relatives have been saying that I intentionally made my family look bad and that the food was fine as it was frozen and then defrosted for the wedding. They say no one would have known if I didn't make a stink over it. I don't know if I did anything wrong, I could use some help and would like to know if I should apologize.

They recently decided to get married for tax reasons and wanted to do a courthouse wedding, but my mom BEGGED her to let her do an \"event\". So, she had a small wedding with only 50 people.

It was decorated with ribbons and bows so I assumed it was a gift for me. She handed it to me with the same big grin on her face. It was obvious she was excited to see me reaction.

This will obviously be a bit expensive (at least 2k USD per person and that is an enormous amount of money in my currency). Camila is in her last semester of university and will start a full time job on August. Right now she's not working and lives with my parents (not passing judgment on her for being unemployed because my brother and I went through the same at her age).Camila called me last week to ask if we could pay for her ticket and accomodation (my parents would pay for food and activities). My husband and I can comfortably afford our family, but adding Camila would put financial pressure on us. I told her that I would discuss it with my husband and then I would call her.So my husband and I agreed that we would be willing to pay for her if she would babysit our children on certain occasions. Of course, not every day and without notice, but at least twice a week for two hours for two months. She would basically be the replacement for our current babysitter.Anyway, I texted her basically saying what I just wrote, and she replied \"Absolutely not.\" So I called her to ask why she was so against this arrangement, which I think benefits both of us: she gets to go on vacation and we have a babysitter we trust and don't spend more than our monthly budget.Camila said  that we were manipulating her into doing unpaid labor to us and forcing her to say yes because neither our brother or parents could afford to pay for her. She also said that she's way to busy with her last semester of uni and finals. I told her that she could do all of her school stuff in our house, my children are very well behaved and need very little supervision, but she still said that she wouldn't do it. So I then told her that I was very sorry but if she didn't accept then we couldn't pay for her to go on the vacation.So now she's incredibly mad at me. But now my mom is also angry with me because she wants to have a family vacation and she knows my husband and I do have the money to pay for Camila, and \"family helps family\", which I agree with, but I believe that help must be reciprocal and right now Camila is not reciprocating that help.

We told her no, she's not a in a serious relationship and she and her kids are already about 5% of our total guest list. Our caterer also doesnt charge less for kids so we're paying about $400 for those 4 kids to be there, we dont want to pay another $100 for some random that she'd bring.

We told her she has 4 kids there, that should be more than enough instead of having a \"plus one\".My dad is my side, and is tired of her taking up their house, my mom is a little more sympathetic and saying I should allow her to have a plus one because thats what you do for adults. Spending $600 on just my sister her kids and a date when she's not seeing anyone seriously just seems ridiculous to me though. She is pretty ticked off though. Am I being the AH here?",

But I also didn’t think they would end up together so I didn’t think to press on it. She is constantly dating all these men, probably to make up for her severe daddy issues that I also have but we don’t need to get into that. I feel terrible because my sister was so excited to tell me she’s engaged, and I flipped out on her. I told her how disgusting it is that he is an old man and that she wouldn’t be able to live her life the way she wants to with a guy like that.

Sara has full  custody of Nathan with her ex having scheduled visitations one weekend of every month. Sara and Nathan moved in with me a little over a year and a half ago and in my perspective, it was a little rocky at first. I've always been pretty protective of my space so making room for two other people was difficult for me. When Sara moved in with me we agreed that the visitations for Mark would be held in our apartment as long as I'm home. The main reason I wanted this is because I don't know Mark that well, and I don't want him wandering around our apartment without me there. When we proposed this idea to Mark, he was fine with it.Now moving on to the real issue. Three weeks ago marked four months since Mark's last visit so I had asked Sara when he was planning on visiting Nathan. My gf replied by shrugging her shoulders and telling me she'd ask. She never followed up with it. So a few days ago, I asked when Mark's next visit was and Sara said she'd tell me when she knew. Nathan was in the living room but had apparently overheard us and shouted something along the lines of \"dad was here last weekend remember\". Sara's face immediately dropped and when I asked what Nathan meant, she wouldn't give me a direct answer.Eventually she ended up telling me that for the past two visits, Mark had been to our apartment when I was working. When I accused her of going back on our agreement, she kept telling me this was her home too and she could invite whoever she wanted, and that it was fine because she was here and watching. I told her that was besides the point and she violated my trust. It blew up into a huge argument with ended in me telling her to get out of my apartment. She packed up and left with Nathan. Last I heard she was staying with her parents.I've gotten several messages from both Sara and her parents calling me an asshole for kicking Sara and Nathan out of their home for something so small. She's even been blasting me on Instagram and Facebook about how horrible I am to do this to her. It's got me thinking I might be the AH but I'm not entirely sure yet.

Odette planned to wear great-great grandma Mary's veil, which has a distinct lace pattern and is passed to only the eldest daughter. In our family it's considered good luck, heavily sentimental, and we have multiple bridal pictures of eldest daughters in the veil while standing with their mom and grandma.The bridal party and family met at Odette's house before driving to the venue. The veil had been in a garment bag, hung up in front of a closet door, but the door had been opened, the hanger fell off, and none of us missed it when we packed up. We made it to the venue by noon for the 4pm wedding. Odette realized the veil was missing and ran to me in a panic, insisting I needed to be the one to go find it: mom wouldn't drive fast enough, middle sister Constance was her MOH, and dad was dealing with setup.  I didn't think I could make it there and back, but Odette insisted and said that if needed we could stall the ceremony a little.I floored it but sat in bumper-to-bumper traffic for almost two hours, Waze estimating I wouldn't be at her house until at least 2:45pm. I texted Odette that if I didn't turn around now, I wasn't going to make it. She texted back \"JUST GET IT HERE.\" When I emphasized that I wouldn't make it for her wedding ceremony or reception if I didn't turn around, she said \"The photographer doesn't leave until 7, just get it here before then so mom, grandma, and I can take pictures.\" I made it to her house on adrenaline, but it took me forever to find the veil and get on the road again.Odette's texts continued after the wedding ceremony and pictures. I was already exhausted, sitting in rush hour traffic, and upset that I'd missed the entire thing. After re-reading our texts they were all about Mary's veil. I realized that she didn't care at all about me being there, which upset me enough to turn around at 5:30pm, with an estimated arrival of 6:30pm and getting later. I texted Odette that I was sorry, but the veil was put up and the house key was in the flower pot.

I was treated differently. I was not given the same anything. Yet the rules remained in place that I call John \"dad\" and would get punished for any instance of not. Mom always took his side, always backed him up, always agreed that he deserved some kind of respect for this stuff.

It’s for everything.Father’s Day, he forgot even though his sister and I reminded him and he didn’t even show up for cake. That made my husband really sad. My breaking point was I got called into work last night for an emergency. Husband is gone for the week and my daughter was asleep. All I asked is for him to put the leftovers away since I need to leave ASAP. It was so simple yet when I came back home at 3 am they were still out.I went to his room, he was still up and we got into an argument, if he can’t do anything for this family we won’t do shit for him. I then took back the money I gave him for a trip and told him to pay for it himself. He called me a jerk and my daughter is happy with the outcome. My mother called it to extreme even though we have talked about this multiple times.Yes, I have tried to talk to him about this it’s like brick wall so if something happened at college he is not telling me.",

They had a daughter together, Alice (16f), who was Rachel’s entire world. Rachel ended up being diagnosed with cancer when she was a few weeks away from delivery and after Alice was born, she started chemo asap. It ended up being treatment resistant and aggressive, and Rachel ended up passing by the time Alice was 2.Daniel emotionally checked out completely. He decided to take a job opportunity abroad, and he left Alice in mine and my wife’s custody. At first he said it was temporary, that he just needed to get things in order before Alice came to live with him, but eventually it was obvious that it would be much longer. He signed his rights over to us, and we've been raising her alongside our three sons. As far as the boys are concerned, Alice is their big sister, and as far as Alice is concerned, they’re her little brothers.Daniel got remarried, and he had two daughters. Alice wasn’t invited to the wedding, we only found out about it after his brother mentioned it to us.Daniel does send money for her, and they write letters back and forth like he and Rachel used to do in school. I know that there has to be some part of him that loves his daughter, but it’s hard to believe it considering how he practically abandoned her after Rachel died.Daniel’s brother Wes has helped out a bit with Alice too. She’ll go over to his house at least once a month to see him, his wife, and their kids. A few days ago, I was taking Alice over, and when we got there, we saw that Daniel + his wife and kids were there. I was ready to get back in the car and take Alice home but Daniel saw us and came outside.He came up to Alice and tried to hug her but she stepped back from him. He looked hurt and when he asked why she didn’t want to give her dad a hug— I snapped. I asked how he could seriously stand there and refer to himself as her dad when all he’s ever been to her is a pen pal. I called him a joke of a father and a sorry excuse for a man.His wife and their daughters overheard what I said. When Alice and I got back home, Wes called me and left a message saying that he agrees that Daniel hasn’t been the best father to Alice, but I didn’t need to tell him that in front of his wife & their kids. Daniel feels the same way.I did apologize to Alice for disparaging her father, but she just shrugged and said it would’ve only been disparaging if it wasn’t true.My wife said she probably would’ve done worse if she’d been there, but part of me does feel that I could have said it out of earshot of his children.",

I was absolutely astonished, speechless even. Michael was shocked and my inlaws and other guests INCLUDING Michael's friends were staring at me in awkward silence. I felt so humiliated, especially when some of the men laughed. Next thing I knew, I yelled at her and was grabbing my stuff about to leave and Michael and his daughter telling me to calm down it was just a prank. I left immediately and turned my phone off. Mivhael left many texts and voice messages calling me \"hypersensitive\" and claiming I ruined his birthday by walking out over a prank.

We were advised by our pediatrician to not allow anyone besides ourselves to kiss our baby for the first 8-12 weeks minimum. This has been communicated to both of our families who have been respectful of this (as well as our other boundaries/rules) despite a little bit of grumbling about it from his side.Last weekend we were over at my in-laws house and I had just finished breastfeeding my daughter, so she was all sleepy. I kissed her forehead before settling her to nap on my chest.My MIL noticed and immediately remarked on it in a super passive-aggressive manner: \"Oh, I'm so glad that we're able to kiss [baby] now! Did your pediatrician update the rules?\"I was super confused and asked her what she meant and that the pediatrician's recommendation hadn't changed. She then accused me of violating the rules by kissing my own baby. I told her that the recommendation was that no one besides myself and my husband kiss our daughter, and she argued and heavily implied that I was being dishonest because I'd previously said \"nobody can kiss the baby\" rather than \"nobody but husband and I can kiss the baby.\"She went on and on about this until I snapped that it should've been obvious that the rules we told her regarding our baby were about what we would/wouldn't allow OTHER PEOPLE people to do. She called me a hypocrite so I got up and shut myself in the guest room while my daughter continued to nap on me.A little while later MIL came in and \"apologized,\" claiming it was a kneejerk reaction and she was just confused and upset. She said she understands now that the rule only applies to other people. She then asked me if I would avoid kissing my baby in front of her until she's allowed to do so as well, because it's upsetting to see me doing that and knowing that she can't.I told her I can understand that it's frustrating to have strong urge to kiss a baby and not be able to.

I tried to persuade him to stay in school for a backup plan but he explained to me that the drop shipping market is huge and he'll make more money than he would if he got his degree.A while ago I got a waitressing job at a very popular food chain, if I said the name it's likely a lot of people would know it (and for context, my work is the first location in the chain). I won't lie, I make minimum wage, but decent with the tipping. My boyfriends business actually makes decent money (around $3000-$4000 per month).

The first thing he said was \"how old is she?, what's her salary? hah, must be $7.50 an hour.\" I told him that she was around my grandmothers age and he started berating her for still working at her age and how she still doesn't have enough money to retire. I was getting really irritated at him and decided to tell him the rest of my story about her \"her and her husband founded the chain, they're probably multi-millionaires, they've earned more than you will probably ever make with your 'business'.\" I definitely said more but I can't remember what exactly. I think he started crying because he stopping talking and locked himself in the bathroom, the last thing he said to me was \"can you actually stop shaming me, my job pays for our rent.\"I feel so horrible about what I said but I just thought he needed to understand that making fun of peoples jobs is terrible, I also understand that I do live with him and his job definitely lets us live more comfortably that the average people our age.",

They were playing in the yard while most of the adults hung out on the backyard deck. And like always, the parents saw other adults in the area and decided to just walk away and go inside. I don't know why this is a thing a lot of parents tend to do. Parents, why do you just walk away  at outings and expect other people to watch your kids? I don't get it. I could see if it is your immediate family but even then I would warn someone that I was not going to be watching for the safety of my kids.It was near the end of the night so some people were gone. It was also getting dark and colder so people were inside. The kids were still running around the playing outside I decided to go home. I went inside and said goodbye to the host. Then I got in my car out front and was on my phone for a minute and someone angrily walked up and asked me why I left the backyard. They said I was back there and they were counting on me to watch the kids. Note that this was never said to me. They just went inside and said nothing. I was on the deck and at no point in the night was I ever paying attention to the kids. Nothing dangerous happened to the kids. The parent just saw me walking to my car and freaked out. I told her it's not my job to watch your kids but I probably would have stuck around IF I was asked. I was just sitting on the deck drinking beer and minding my own business. I had already been going back and forth from outside to socialize the whole night like everyone else. Not sure why I was the one singled out. There were times when another person happened to be outside and I was inside. Did they assume we were taking shifts? I don't get the mentality of parents but maybe I'm the asshole here.Also want to note that the backyard is NOT fenced off. She brought that up a lot and I just retorted with \"even more reason to stay with your kids.\" The backyard was one of those open ones that opens into the forest.BEfore this gets out of hand. I did not drive drunk. I had a single drink and was not drunk or even somewhat tipsy.edtI don't think it's clear so I will clarify. I had no knowledge of being on kid duty. The backyard is large and open and lead into the forest. I was on the small deck by the house. At no point in the night was I watching or listening to for kids.

So on Friday the electric guy came to fix his bedroom and my brother had a bunch of boxes and trash in his room. So my mom and my brother made the absolutely genius decision to dumb all his trash into My room. When I came home I was pissed, because there was 3 boxes, 2 trash bags (one fell down and it was open) and trash spilled all over my room. I was really pissed.I decided that I was just going to ignore all the trash in my room. Yesterday my mom came into my room and told me to \"clean my disgusting room\" and I told her that SHE needs to clean my room because She is the one who made the mess in my room. She told me its my responsibility to clean my own room because she gives my housing and food. I told her I didnt ask to be born. Then she threatened to take away my computer and I told her that she can pay me $1000 for it because I paid for the whole thing. She told me I was being entitled. Now she's all mad and my room is still not clean. AM I being an Entitled Asshole?Edit: Can you guys stop calling my parents abusive?Update 6.17.23So my brother found this post. He came into my room and said he was sorry and he spent 30 minutes cleaning my room. He took it to the trash room and dumped it in the dumpster. Did I mention the trash room was only a 2 minute walk away? My mom came to me earlier and told me that she shouldn't have pinned everything on me and she was sorry. I told her I was sorry for saying that I didnt ask to be born. My dad was in Phillidelphia during this whole thing for the people wondering where he was. My mom went and got me ice cream. Again, she is not abusive.I was considering just returning the trash to the brothers room or taking the L and cleaning the trash myself. Then I realized that some of the trash might have been stuff my bro wanted to keep so I decided to dump it in his room. That was before he just came and cleaned it himself.

They were upfront with me and SIL about wanting a lot of kids from our early days of dating.SIL and BIL are starting to try for their first kid, and SIL has been leaning on me for emotional support, which I am very glad to provide.Last Sunday, she asked me to be brutally honest about what it's like to have 6 kids. I told her that my experience will not be very helpful to her, seeing as how our situations are very different, and she asked me to explain.So I told her that I am a SAHM wife with a passive income in the high 6 figures, my husband makes over 300k a year, so we are lucky enough to not have to think about the financials when it comes to a large family.Same goes with child care, I have 2 nannies, that is the only way I found to be able to give all my kids the attention they need, seeing as my youngest has health issues. And that even without those health issues, 6 kids are a lot of work without someone there.And finally, my husband and I were looking into adoption and surrogacy because pregnancy is hard on the body, so 3 was my limit of pregnancies, and that we were lucky that we were able to foster to adopt our 3 adoptive kids. But if we didn't, adopting 3 extra kids, or hiring surrogates was going to be very expensive.Well, apparently she talked with BIL, and told him what I said, as well as how they should maybe space having kids more, so they could give them a higher living standards, and now he is accusing me of manipulating her, and being a jealous bitch who wants to be the only one with the big family.Was I an AH by telling her everything I did?",

He informed me that he was proposing to his girlfriend (29F) as well.The next day, my brother came to my apartment while my girlfriend was out. He asked me if he could \"borrow\" my ring to propose to his girlfriend.I thought he was joking at first, but no. His plan was to propose to his girlfriend, explain he was using my ring as a \"placeholder\" and then take her to pick her own ring later. His reasoning was that he didn't want to spend too much money right away in case she didn't say yes. I'd never heard of \"placeholder rings\", so I said no and the conversation moved on.On Tuesday, he proposed to his girlfriend. With my ring. He'd taken it before leaving my apartment. I got distracted at work and didn't notice it was gone until his fiancée sent a picture of herself wearing the ring to our family group chat.I called him to ask about the ring, and he immediately apologized and said he'd \"keep his promise\" and give it back to me. But at this point, my girlfriend had seen it and his fiancée had posted about it on social media, so it was pointless for me to propose using the same ring.We fought about it, and he confessed that while he'd told his fiancée the ring was a placeholder, he didn't tell her where he'd gotten it from.I felt more angry and betrayed about him going behind my back and taking the ring after I said no than the fact that he stole it. I also know his fiancée enough to know she wouldn't like to learn her engagement ring had been stolen from me, so I told my brother I'd tell her the truth if he didn't buy me a new engagement ring.He fought against it for a few hours, but finally gave up and agreed. We went to a different jewelry store yesterday, and I picked a new ring. I managed to stay in the price range, but the new one was still $100 more expensive.My brother bought the ring, but is still accusing me of being inconsiderate and childish. He is insistent he would have given me the ring back had I given him the opportunity, and I didn't need to threaten him to spend so much money on me. He's now refusing to talk to me.I don't know how to feel about this anymore. I'd usually talk to my brother about these things, and it's surreal that he's the one I'm fighting. I can't tell my girlfriend, and many of our friends overlap.The only other person who knows about this is our mom, who's divided: she thinks what my brother did was wrong and I'm right to be pissed at him, but I didn't have to stoop as low as I did by threatening his relationship.AITA?EDIT: Accidentally called my girlfriend \"fiancée\".

Not until she removes that stocking and it doesn't look like she's going to do it cause he spoke with her and he's now mad at me for \"making a huge deal out of it\". Her husband Philip who's usually nice to me called yesterday saying that he spoke with Todd and he'd be devastated if I cause \"the family\" to miss the event at Monica's house and ruin it not only for the adults but for the kids as well since my stepson loves spending the holidays with his cousins.Todd has been quiet and the only way we communicate is through Philip. I feel ashamed. Maybe I overreacted. AITA?Edit# to answer someone's question, no, I did not ask Monica to put a stocking for my son (she said it was for my son) It was her decision although I find it weird since the baby isn't even born yet.",

I like both of my kids equally however they are different individuals with different lives so I help them based on their needs.My son did not do well in high school and went to a community college and decided it was not for him after a semester and went to trade schools and eventually settled on HVAC. He had issues sticking to things, so as a reward when he became certified in HVAC I bought him a brand new truck as gift.My daughter got into a good college out of state and was always more academically minded. When she was about to finish HS it came to a surprise to me that she had taken it for granted that I would also get her a new car even though I never said that. I explained that there would be no need for a college girl in a big city to have a car. She then asked if I could help with tuition, I did not pay for trade school either so I declined. Eventually she seemed down so I offered to buy a used car in my name, and she could use it for a while until I decided to sell it but she would have to maintain it. She seemed really happy with that so we got an old 99 BMW for really cheap. The body was in good condition, but the engine and transmission needed work and it needed painting.She did the essential fixes first but then slowly did unnecessary ones even though I never asked for that and repainted most of the car and had the interior detailed.When she came back for a visit this week after finishing her finals, I decided it was time to sell the car and listed it. She seems upset with me even though we had agreed to it and I never asked her to repaint the car. She said she thought I was going to sell it much later when it rusted or something. She also says I can sell it more expensive because of her fixes but the reality is I got the car just before the pandemic and used cars cost a lot more since and that is why I can sell it for more. I offered to pay her back for the half of the paintwork.AITA here?EDIT: ok seems people think it was wrong, but my son only got the truck after schooling and my daughter has not finished school yet. I have not thought of her graduation gift yet. But the car is only listed and I will think about it and reconsider.EDIT2: Ok i will let her keep it and de-list it for now.

I was relentlessly bullied by them for various things  I couldn't control: Having a speech impediment,  having less expensive clothes, only being to see my dad on weekends, etc.My mom and step-dad didn't do anything to stop it and essentially told me \" kids will be kids\" then kept it pushing. My mom would lightly scold Violet and Mabel if they hurt me while \" playing\" but wouldn't do anything more.I had to watch as they got far more expensive gifts for birthdays and Christmas and actually what they wanted from their wishlist whilst I got the bare minimum of necessities and would only get something I actually wanted from my dad but he could only go far due to making 2x less than what my step-dad makes. I appreciated it nonetheless.I didn't even get to properly enjoy  my cake or rather cupcakes that my mom made to \" cut down on cost\" because my siblings ate it before I could get seconds.I was never allowed a party because my friends were \" too messy and loud.\"Around age ten, I pretty much stopped expecting them to put effort into my birthday and just kinda let it pass by whenever I was with them.Yesterday was my eighteenth birthday and I decided to spend it with my friends, boyfriend, and dad.I was pretty much was out all day and came back at around nearly 10pm, my mom was waiting for me with my step-dad and pretty much blew up on me for not spending the day with them.Apparently they prepared a small celebration for me that got wasted because I wasn't there.They were both going off on me for being inconsiderate and ungrateful. In the middle of their little rant I had snapped that they never fucking cared about my birthday all these years, why should this one matter now?They were in shock and that gave me an opportunity to go to my room and sleep.I woke up to texts from my grandparents and aunt saying that I was disrespectful for saying that and ungrateful for anything my mom and step-dad did for me.Edit: Just to be clear I put my step-siblings' current ages within the post,not the ages when they were bullying me.

I put a lot of effort into birthdays (including his) and was pretty excited about it for the last month or so. There is a local bakery that makes a really good-looking pineapple upside down cake. I have been really wanting to try it and have been saving it for my birthday. About a month in advance, I told him my birthday was coming up and gave him a few activity ideas, and told him that I didn't need a gift but I really wanted a pineapple upside down cake from XYZ Bakery, he said \"sure.\"Now...I know this was probably annoying, but I did mention this specific cake several times, even before last month. Like we would drive by the bakery and I'd say something like \"Oh hey that's the place with the pineapple cake, I wanna do that for my birthday.\" I wasn't deliberately hammering the point home or anything (or aware that it was gonna end in a cake-centered conflict), but there were a couple occasions where it came up. And then a week before my birthday I did text him a reminder about the cake so that he would have the bakery info on hand.Yesterday rolls around and my boyfriend comes over to my apartment and gives me a gift, which is a Kindle. Not a bad gift and I know they are expensive, but not something particularly relevant to me either. Then he says let's have cake, and presents what you all know by now is not the pineapple upside down cake, but just a regular grocery store cake with the frosting balloons. Vanilla cake with vanilla buttercream. You guys, I was legitimately sad. If I knew he was gonna drop the ball on this, I would have just gotten myself a pineapple cake months ago instead of waiting. I was on the verge of tears because of not getting the one thing I actually wanted which was that stupid cake, so I told him I was very disappointed and that he should just go home. He had two tickets to a comedy show for that night and one ended up going to waste. Now he's annoyed because it is of course \"just a cake\" and wants me to reimburse the cost of the wasted ticket. It was only about $30, but I'm bristling at the principal of it and said I didn't owe him the money. He sent me a Venmo request for $30, AITA if I don't pay?",

When she first started going to dialysis about 5 months ago, she put me down as her emergency contact, and at first I just sucked it up and dealt with it(because she doesn't have anyone else in this part of the country and my older sister doenst talk to her for reasons you can imagine.) However, yesterday when the clinic contacted me, and I had to pick her up I informed her that she needed to put someone else down because I wouldn't be answering those calls anymore after she had her family members leave threatening messages to my older sister. This pissed her off, and she started going on about why I didn't love her anymore and when I stopped loving her. So I told her, I told her the exact moment I stopped loving her, and respecting her was when I was 13. I had just entered high school. I was big into football, and the coach at that time was brutal. He was making us practice two times a day, at 5 am. and after school. I told her how I woke up one morning and she was passed out on the couch off of whatever substance she was using at the time and my older sister only 15 at the time was freaking out because we had no food...we never had any food. She was freaking out thinking I was going to pass out from all of that practice and barely eating. I tried to assure her that I would be fine, but she went into that kitchen grabbed the only things we had which were 2 day old almost burnt rice, salt, a can of green beans, and half a chicken breast and made me and our siblings an entire fried rice meal. She made sure I ate that morning, and I ate that meal on my way to practice crying. She had to stay home from school that day like she did most days to send younger sisters off to school and to be there to pick them up. When I got home from that day, my sister was in the kitchen cooking dinner, and there were some groceries in the fridge that she brought with the money that she got from selling her rings that our grandma gave her to some sketchy ass guy that used to hangout at the convenience store.

I have medicated cream that helps with the itchiness, and also it helps with the dryness. The psoriasis is all over my body with it stopping right on my neck, and I do have a few spots on the sides of my face near my ears.I’ve always been pretty embarrassed as I cannot cake on enough makeup to truly cover my psoriasis as it is textured and thick, and on top of that, no matter what I do or however I attempt to apply said makeup it always looks horrible, my doctor also recommended not to smother the areas with makeup as it tends to make it worse and itchier.Anyways, onto the story. My friend's wedding was on Saturday and of course, I was invited. I bought a dress that would cover my body fairly well as I really didn’t want to draw any attention to myself. The entire week leading up to the wedding I was continuously testing concealers on the remaining spots that were exposed, which only made me itchy and I basically scratched my skin raw. With psoriasis, those areas sometimes bleed if I scratch too much, which is what happened.My boyfriend who was attending the wedding with me told me I shouldn’t worry about it and that it would be better if I stopped trying to cover them as it was just making it worse.I reluctantly agreed, and we attended the wedding ceremony. It was great, I was extremely happy for my friend and her now husband. But as we were leaving to go to cocktail hour, she pulled me aside and asked if I was going home to cover my psoriasis.I was a little taken aback and explained I couldn’t as the entire week I had been testing concealers and it made it 20 times worse. She told me she didn’t care and that this was her wedding and she didn’t want her guests asking me questions or feeling queasy during dinner.My boyfriend stepped in and told her if that was the case we would be leaving and not attending the rest of the wedding. She was pissed off and extremely angry at that choice, and ever since then she’s been ranting to our friends about it.AITA here?Edit: Wow this blew up, I am trying to read through all the comments that I missed during work, thank you all for the comments, awards and the recommendations too, it has given me a lot to consider.

We've been considered middle-class, doing things others werent  as privileged to do such as buying our daughter a car on her 16th birthday.I come from a family of immigrants and was considered in poverty growing up, after learning about the bullying i was furious as we thought we didnt raise her to behave that way. She was in honors and top ranking of her class.I tried to talk to our daughter over why she would do that and i was disturbed to learn it was because she viewed that girl as \"trailer trash\" which irrated me. The girl from what i learned is very smart and works hard, she bought her own beater car buy herself and works 2 jobs. She considered the money our family had as our families money, so i put her in her place and told her that it was not her money but her mom and I's money.I decided from that point i was spoiling my daughter too much, we ended up taking away her latest iphone and replacing it with my old iphone 8 (by switching phones with me) with a talk and text plan . We took away her family credit car,sold her car, along with her macbook and other luxuries.I also told her should would have to find a job without neopotism and work a minimum wage job like everyone else her age, because i'm done giving her handouts if shes gonna act entitled.Fast forward 2 months later, she is working at a fast food resturant with us driving her around. She doesnt talk to me unless she needs something like a ride but is very upset with me.My wife feels like i am taking this too far because its affecting her social status and grades and school I however feel like she needs to be humbled because i cant have a daughter who will disrespect people just because the amount of money they have. I also feel that her behaving this way will affect her younger sister (f12) and how she precieves the world.AITA for punishing my 16-year-old step-daughter after we found out she was bullying a kid for being poor?Edit:I also like to add, we took away her MacBook but she still has access to the family computer in the house. Windows computer for school that is powerful (i7 and great gpu) and recently newShe still has wifi access at the house however we did throttle her speed because high speed internet is a privilege, she has fast enough internet to do homework and watch videos that aren’t in HD like Netflix and stuff.She also isn’t failing, she went from a straight A student to mostly B’s and 2 A’s which I still find great.Edit #2:This blew up, I would like to clarify some things, yes we are upper-middle class, not multi-millionaires or anything like that but enough to live comfortablyShe is practically my daughter as I’ve raised her since she was practically 4 and her real father walked out on the family when she was 2, my wife helps runs the business and we both agree on punishments. We came to an agreement that I would make decisions with her on things.We did talk with the family and had her apologize to the girl at school, she was required to do 5 hours of community service at the school (volunteering for food drives and after school activities) due to the schools no bully policy.We also didn’t force her to get a job, she wanted the job to get money so she could hang out with her friends, and buy things she wanted. We just cut her off from her $15/hr receptionist job for a non-nepotism job. We also warned her that if her grades become too unsustainable she would be forced to quit her job and focus on school because she doesn’t need extracurricular activities outside of school she needs to focus on her education.",

I told Donna this in advance and she said she’d be quiet. I fell asleep at about 9:30. However, at around 1 am, I woke up to the sound of Donna scream-crying—literal screaming, like someone had just died. I immediately got out of bed and went over to her and asked her what was wrong, thinking something horrible had just happened.It took me a little bit to get it out of her, but she managed to tell me that Malcolm had just broken up with her over text. I felt awful for her (no one deserves that) and spent a while trying to comfort her, but she wouldn’t calm down at all. She just kept sobbing and sobbing very loudly, which is very understandable since it was my understanding that they had been together for a while.Here’s where I might be the asshole though: eventually, it started to get closer to 2:30 AM and Donna still wasn’t calming down. But I needed my sleep since I had a midterm in 5 hours, so I suggested we both just go to sleep and revisit it later. She just looked at me like I was insane and asked if I really expected her to sleep. And then kept crying. I knew it was unlikely she’d calm down any time soon, so I very gently asked her if she could leave the room until she was able to calm down a bit so I could sleep.Again, Donna just looked at me like I was crazy and didn’t say anything, just kept crying. I repeated myself (again, being as nice as possible) that she could go to the bathroom or the laundry room to compose herself and come back when she was ready. Finally, she just got up without looking at me and stomped out (still crying) and I just went back to sleep. When I woke up for my midterm, she was back in her bed and sleeping, but since then she’s hardly said a word to me.To note, I couldn’t go to a friend’s dorm to spend the night since a) most of my friends live in dorms that are farther away and I don’t want to walk by myself in the city at night and b) I wouldn’t wanna bother them on such short notice.However, I still feel terrible about what happened since she was going through a lot, and I’d really appreciate outside perspectives.",

In fact, it became more of a pointless chore like making your bed or folding your underwear. I might had gotten a few things out of it but would not do it again.A few weeks ago, I had told our therapist that it's bizarre to not have to worry about money for the first time in my life. I make good money and don't have many bills. I'm saving like $1,000 a month.Last week the therapist asked me if I could start making a copayment. I don't have a copayment because my insurance covers 100% of therapy sessions. I explained that to her. She said that was true but maybe I could start paying like $20 cash because she's not making a lot with what my insurance pays her. Like a tip.I was at a loss for words. I said \"and I suppose this has no relation to my telling you that I had disposable income from a few weeks ago?\" She said of course not. It was like she was asking for a raise lol. I said I'd think about it.I found nothing about \"tipping\" your therapist. I talked to my ex and said I was firing the therapist. She told me not to throw away 2 years of work and I said this therapist tried taking advantage of me. She offered to pay and I said I'm not stopping you but I'm not doing the sessions anymore and neither is are son. The trust I had in our therapist is forever broken.I left a voicemail and text message explaining we weren't in need of services anymore. I haven't heard back. Guess what? Our lives didn't fall apart and the therapist replied that I totally misunderstood this whole tip thing.",

Her mom is very inconsistent in her life, when it's things like Christmas, birthday, she shows up and it's all sunshine and unicorns, but otherwise, she can't be bothered, too busy pursuing the \" normal 20s\" she so craved.This past weekend my daughter was invited to a birthday party, the parents were invited, and more or less, encouraged to stay.I had nothing better to do so, I stayed.Most of the parents I knew, but there were a few I didn't.At this point, I'm used to watching people work out the age math in real time. I've explained that I know I'm young, but, I'd like to think I deserve some kudos for being 5 years in, and I'd like to think I'm not totally incompetent.About a half hour in and this lady comes up to me, asks which one is mine. I pointed my daughter Morgan out. I ask which is hers, she points her daughter out.She goes, \" So, are you an older cousin pulling chauffeur duty or a step-brother or...\"I said that I was Morgan's dad. Shocked look, which she quickly tried to get rid. She asks if Morgan's mom was at this party too, I said she wasn't and told her I was a single dad, I didn't want to get all specific and say Morgan's mom only shows up when it's fun days like birthday & Christmas.This lady goes, \" Jeez, and, you know what you're doing?\"I said that I take it day by day, situation by situation.She goes, \" You really have to know what you're doing.\"I told her I understood.She asks me what my plan is if I started to \" slip\" as a parent.I told her my plan is to drive Morgan into the woods, tape $20 dollars to her wrist, give her a hearty handshake, wish her good luck and tell her to run free.Lady gets mad, tells me she asked a legitimate question and said she hopes that my clear lack of maturity doesn't seep into my parenting.I walked over to Morgan, gave her a big hug, told her I loved her, and kept it moving.AITA?",

When the girls were younger (1-4) we used to do shared birthday parties. But my husband and I realized that we were always the ones to foot the bill for everything (food, decorations, location etc.). The girls also were complete opposites. My daughter has always been more of a tomboy, while my niece is SUPER girly.When my husband and I told SIL and my brother that we won't be doing the shared birthday's anymore, they we really upset and it started a huge fight. They said they can't afford to throw a nice birthday for my niece but we can, so it makes sense that we pay for it since we're \"family\".Yeah, not gonna fly with my husband and I. So we stuck by what we said and every since the girls have had separate birthday's.My daughter and my husband love watching Formula 1 together, and she wanted to have a Formula 1 themed birthday this year.The weekend before the birthday we had a family dinner at my parents house. SIL, my brother and niece were present. My parents were asking the girls if they were excited for their upcoming birthday's, and if they were having parties this year?My daughter told my parents she is having a Formula 1 themed party this year. SIL answered for my niece and said they're not going to have a party for her because thing's were tight. The conversation was left there.Fast forward to this past weekend (daughters bday was on Saturday) we had the party and it was going great. The whole family was invited as usual, and everyone was having a great time until the cake.I'm in the kitchen with my mom, MIL, SIL and a few other family friends talking. I pull the cake out to get it ready to bring out for everyone. SIL takes a look at the cake and looks confused.SIL: \"is this the girls birthday cake?\"Me: \"what do you mean 'the girls'? the cake is for *daughters name*\"SIL: \"well I thought since I mentioned that thing's are tight this year, that you'd include *niece's name* in the birthday?\"Me: \"I understand your situation, but how come you never once mentioned this to me?\"SIL: \"Well I thought it would be common sense? Now my daughter isn't going to have any kind of celebration for her birthday this year because you and you husband are so selfish\".She then stormed out of the kitchen, made a huge scene at the party outside yelling to her husband and my niece that it's time to go and left. Since then she's been messaging me and my husband non stop trying to make us feel guilty that my niece isn't going to have a birthday party, and calling us all kinds of names.I feel bad that my niece isn't going to get a birthday party.

My nephew told them that having his sister help was pointless since she's completely nonverbal and has a habit of kicking things when she gets upset. As a result, my nephew had his lego set returned for talking back and being disrespectful.After we went back home, I asked my brother if what my nephew said was true. He said that it was. I then asked if my nephew said anything (e.g., calling his sister a vegetable) beyond calling the idea of letting his sister help ridiculous. He said no.I told my husband that I'm seriously considering buying my nephew the Lego Roman Colosseum for his upcoming birthday in August, as my brother and SIL were being completely ridiculous.

They didn’t tell me I was adopted and I found out in what I consider the worst way when I was 16: a spiteful relative told me. Not out for my best interest but they got mad at my mom and was trying to ruin her life. It caused a huge fight within the family and everyone focused on the drama rather than my entire life crumbling. I finally ended up in therapy at 18 and have been attending on and off for the past 10 years (currently on). I didn’t speak to my parents from the time I was 18 until I was 23. They acted like I was insane for being upset about all this.Eventually, they apologized and began going to therapy themselves. We’ve slowly rebuilt our relationship. They have since accepted my search for my bio family and upon finding my bio mom, have been amazing with her.My bio mom was coerced into giving me up. She hadn’t wanted to but her family all but forced her. She had no support. My parents didn’t know this part but purposefully chose a private adoption so I’d never know I was adopted. My bio mom and I have known each other for 4 years now. She is an amazing, kind and generous woman who is just like me. I spent so long feeling unseen and different. She was like completing a puzzle. My bio dad died when I was 12 and it’s devastating to know I’ll never meet him. He didn’t want to give me up either but they were very young and again, no support.My bio mom told me she had named me Summer, but my adoptive parents changed it. She understood but I could tell the name meant a lot to her.I recently got married and am changing my last name. I decided since I’m changing my last name, I’ll change my middle name too. It’s got no sentimental meaning vs Summer, which does to my bio mom as it’s her favorite season and I was born on the first day of summer. My bio mom cried tears of joy when I told her. She is so touched.My adoptive parents are pissed off. They say that I have erased them. I kept my first name that they gave me. They say if I “had to” I should’ve just added Summer to my name.AITA?EDIT; because some people are twisting my words.I am NOT mad I was adopted. Given my bio mom was coerced and forced, someone had to. I was NOT given up out of love. My bio parents loved me but if they had it their way I would’ve been raised by them.I’m mad I was LIED to for 16 years and by my adoptive parents’ admission they never planned on telling me. I cut them off because they gaslit me and refused to  admit they handled it badly on top of telling me I was crazy for being hurt.I do not need to be grateful I was adopted. I do not need to be grateful they loved me or provided for me. Those are basic things that SHOULD BE done. I am grateful for a lot, but that doesn’t changed the awful things they did.My adoptive parents admitted my middle name is meaningless. They picked it randomly (it’s the stereotypical Marie). So yes, I am sure.Finally, I did NOT change my name to be vindictive. I changed it to represent both families. I am not upset my name was originally changed. I get it.

I explained to her that it might just take me a little while longer to get used to it but I told her I'd use the vacation as a \"get to know him\" time. After the whole conversation, all was good and we were in a good place. My mom had already bought his plane ticket and everything was set. And then TWO weeks later, he told my mom that she was \"too wild\" for him and said that he wanted to end their relationship. He said that he didn't like that she went out as much as she did (the only people she ever \"goes out\" with are people in our family, sisters, cousins, etc.) and that he didn't want to be with her anymore. They broke up and my mom says that he was being an asshole to her after the fact.And for those of you who thought to bring up my own relationship that I posted about in another board - that relationship is over now too.Onward and upward. <3Original Post:My dad lost his 1.5 year battle with cancer one year ago (April 2022) at only 62 yrs old. He and my mom were married for 31 years. The few months before my dad got sick he and my mom were not on great terms and were contemplating divorce. However, through my dad's diagnosis and extreme ups and downs of treatment, they came together, squashed some of their issues and my mom was there to care for my dad every step of the way.I miss him every day. Me and my mom had always been pretty close but since my dad died I feel like I'm seeing and talking to her less and less these days and it makes me sad.In August of 2022 (4 months after my Dad passed) my mom started seeing someone. She'd call him her \"friend\", slip in mentions of him in conversation but I personally wanted NOTHING to do with him. (Still don't.) I thought it was TOO SOON and told her so.Everyone grieves differently and dating after losing a spouse is hard but conversations I've attempted with this guy and the chemistry between them has been super awkward IMO. I feel like she's disregarding any feelings or push-back that me, my sister and extended family have about this relationship. (large extended family, all very close-knit).She has now starting bringing him to events and parties and there is an awkward vibe when he's around. Nobody wants to say it outloud. This past week, he showed up unexpectedly at our family Easter party (at my parents house). My mom knew he was coming and did not mention to anyone. Following tradition - we stood in prayer before we ate dinner and my uncle prayed out loud for those who we have lost and I felt SO awkward that my mom's boyfriend was there, holding hands with my family as we talked about my Dad, in my Dad's house, almost only a year to the day that he died.We're now booking flights for a large family vacation in June (condo has already been booked for MONTHS) and my mom casually mentioned at Easter that she's bringing her boyfriend. I didn't hear this at the time and found out later from a cousin. I immediately called and told her my feelings about him going (I don't want him to) and she completely changed the subject and did not acknowledge what I told her at all.Not to mention, we had decided to leave a day early to save money on flights, but now that her boyfriend is going, it will actually cost me MORE because we will no longer be splitting the costs that we originally planned since they will be doing things separately.Money is not the problem though. It's now principle to me. Of the 20 family members that will be on this trip, not one person really wants him to be there, except her. He WILL be staying in the same condo and we are going to have to tip-toe around this awkward situation for an entire week while we should be relaxing and enjoying family time together.AITA for wanting to cancel on the family vacation and/or stick to my guns about not wanting her boyfriend to go even though she already booked his flight?",

Got to see Steve a couple times, and later Bindi when she got older, at a couple talks / small group settings. My friend said \"wow, you should totally tell my daughter about that!\"So a while later I went into the living room where the daughter was watching the shows, and I told her \"I got to see Steve a couple times before he died and later Bindi,\" and she got excited and started asking me a lot of questions.I told her he seemed like a great guy and as much as I could remember about the animals. Then I told her about a detail about the first \"talk\"/small-ish group I saw him at where he warned us that he had to help cover for a keeper who called in sick and cleaned out the primate houses right before this talk and hadn't showered yet, so we really might not a front row seat. I didn't listen and got one anyways, and...ooof, regretted it. I'm sure it was a great talk and a treasured memory looking back, but at the time all I could think about was how not to gag!This horrified my friend's daughter more than I thought, as she went \"ewww he smelled bad?\" I was sorta taken aback and said \"well, what do you think, being around animals all day every day! That day was worse than others I'm sure, but come to think of it he stunk pretty bad the other time I got close enough to smell him too...so did Bindi, for that matter\"My friend's daughter is apparently also very into spas and perfumes and smelling nice, and this has put a great damper on her thoughts of working with wildlife and even her enthusiasm for seeing it through a screen. My friend called me the next day and said \"Of all the things to share with her did you really have to bring up how Steve Irwin smelled like monkey waste when you met him and distracted you from the talk?\" She said that seemed like an inappropriate thing to bring up to a young girl and also disrespectful to Steve's memory.But I don't think it was inappropriate to bring up, I think it's a realistic part of the work Steve did and was certainly something that stuck in my memory.

	"body" : "UPDATE: I do believe because of my anger and frustration I exaggerated Aaron's flaws in my post below. Has he struggled with his temper? Yes, but I should NOT have described it as hair trigger. I have NEVER thought of him as dangerous. I have NEVER feared for my daughter's safety nor my own.I also described him as jealous/possessive, and while I do see some of those tendencies, he's NEVER tried to restrict her movements or isolate her. She's always dealt with a tremendous amount of anxiety, particularly when it comes to social situations. As much as I loathe to admit it, in this regard, he's been a wonderful cheerleader. He could keep her at home where she feels most secure, but he truly does encourage her to get out and be adventurous.As for his criminal record it's all below the age of 24. He has not been in trouble with the law since. It still makes me uncomfortable, but I can admit he's been stable. In all the time I've known him he's had no issues holding down a job, paying his rent, etc.What bothers me the most is the age gap. I can't explain that away or change it. It is what it is. It makes me uncomfortable. With that said, people here keep saying he's a predator/groomer, but I just don't see that. I could very well be blind/naive. For now, however, I will defend him in this regard.Anyways, if posting here has shown me anything, it's that Aaron's not nearly as bad as I had built him up in my mind. So many people here are imagining a monster. He's just a guy. He means well. He's trying. He's still irritating, opinionated, immature and talks too much. But he does try his damnedest to take care of my daughter. He is a capable present father and loves being one. They are married. He is family.Lots of people have stated they are a unit. They come together or not at all. I've started to agree. It's for that reason I've decided to allow them all to stay with me while they figure things out.____________________________________________________________________________________________________The husband has lived in their apartment for a number of years. The owners recently sold it and the new ones are moving in, so my daughter and her husband have to move. The problem is rents have gone up dramatically. The rent they are paying is $1100 (for a 1 bedroom), which I thought was a lot, but now that I'm trying to help them find a place, most are now going for around $2000 a month or more! They can't afford this.My daughter knows she is always welcome at home, granted a baby complicates things. I wasn't happy about her having a baby (she's young, just turned 22), but I would never deny her housing. However, I can't stand her husband (let's just call him Aaron for simplicity's sake). I wouldn't invite Aaron over for dinner, let alone let him live with me. Aaron's in his mid 30s. Criminal history. Hair trigger temper. Chronically immature and has one hell of a jealous/possessive streak that has caused strain in their relationship (which I obviously do not approve of).Honestly, when she told me she was pregnant, I finally thought we'd be rid of Aaron. I genuinely thought he's exactly the kind of man to ditch (they've been on and off over and over since she was about 18/19). Alas, if anything it made him cling to her tighter. They had a very rushed wedding and this is their longest stint together without any breakups. Just over a year. There's still been the fair share of dramatics, of course, but I am surprised they've made it this far.Even so, I simply don't want to live with Aaron. I don't like him. I don't want him around me. I'd go above and beyond for my daughter and the baby, they can stay as long as they need, but not him.Obviously, this has created a rift between my daughter and I. She doesn't want to live separately from Aaron. I told her then she needs to figure out alternative arrangements. Well, their move out date is rapidly approaching (the 15th of December) and they've still not been able to find a place, and she's panicking. She's been begging me to let them stay.I reiterated my terms. Aaron simply cannot stay here. This led to a lot of tears and some angry words. Namely, me being an asshole. I can genuinely see why she might think that, but I also have to think about myself and my own sanity.",

	"body" : "Before my daughter “Christina” (currently 19F) started high school, I made her a deal that if she kept above a 3.9 GPA for her freshman through junior year, I would buy her a car for up to $20,000 to have her senior year (on condition that if her GPA dipped below a 3.9 I would take it away). She kept a 4.0 throughout high school, so I let her pick out a car before senior year. During her sophomore year, I met my now wife “Jenny” (now 40F) and her daughter “Emily” (17F). Emily started her senior year a couple weeks ago, and a few days ago she texted me asking when I was going to take her to look at cars. This took me by surprise, as I didn’t realize she expected a car. She has a 2.7 GPA and spends more time curating her Instagram than doing her homework. I explained to her that Christina received her car as a reward for good grades, not as a given. I later felt bad because I guess I didn’t give her the same incentive that I gave Christina, and I told her that if she could get a 3.9 GPA with her senior year grades AND get into an accredited college or university, I would let her pick out a car upon graduation.I thought this was a fair deal, or even UNFAIR towards Christina since I made HER keep a 3.9 for all FOUR years of high school, but Jenny pulled me aside after Emily went to school and told me I was being unfair since Emily had different circumstances than Christina. For background, Jenny’s ex husband–and Emily’s bio dad–was a very wealthy man who spoiled the crap out of her. Everything she wanted, all she had to do was ask for, for the first 12 years of her life. She didn’t try in school because her dad promised he would get her into any college she wanted, and give her a job at his company afterwards. Then, when Emily was 12, her dad was arrested for serious tax fraud. Essentially, he is in prison now, and Jenny has some money of her own but nothing compared to the life of luxury they were both used to. I think Emily is very hurt by what happened, and she also hasn’t had the chance to develop a work ethic.I told Jenny that I think my only wrongdoing was not helping Emily develop a work ethic sooner, and that my hope is that she rises to the occasion, cleans up her act, and gets the car. I also said I would do everything I could to help Emily research colleges and perfect her application, but Jenny wasn’t having it. She and Emily have both been giving me the cold shoulder the past couple of days and still think I’m treating Emily unfairly. I really don’t know what to do. I want to give Emily a goal that is challenging but attainable, but at the same time I don’t want to put a strain on my relationship with my family.Edit: FormattingEdit 2: more formatting issues",

I have watched her struggle to afford daycare and food for her baby so I also help her with that.Two days ago my sister sits me down and tells me she has news. She’s pregnant. My jaw dropped. I ask who the dad is and she starts crying. I didn’t expect her to say her deadbeat baby daddy…I was shocked and she continued on her “explanation”: she saw a girl commenting under his posts and she went on her page and saw they had taken pictures at the same place at the same time. The girl also posted him for his birthday weeks later saying “happy birthday to my fiance”. She messaged her letting her know hes a deadbeat and got blocked. Then her baby daddy called her saying shes a crazy bitch and that led to them getting a hotel room and they slept with each other… all to prove some point to his fiance that hes not loyal and she can have him whenever she wants because she sent her proof after they slept together but the fiance stayed with him…As she’s telling me this story I just sit there upset. I started asking her if she went to the doctor and how far along is she. She said she did stop by PP and got a scan, shes nine weeks. We live in a blue state so abortion is legal here. I told my sister that I wasnt going to be resigning the lease unless she got an abortion. She looked at me with so much disgust and started crying harder. She called me an evil bitch and said Im a horrible person for making her choose between her baby or having housing. I told her with her hours now she cant afford even half the rent let alone the daycare she splits between me, our dad, and aunt so to understand the position she’s putting me in since the responsibility is falling on me.She told our family and they’re pissed saying Im being heartless to even ask her that and that I shouldn’t punish her and if I should sign at least 6 months so she can get her shit together since 5 weeks isnt alot of time. I said no, she’s ungrateful for all the help Ive done so Im out. They’re saying Im an asshole since when I didn’t qualify she let me live with her (even though I paid half).",

	"body" : "Last year I moved in with my bf and his dad. My bf and I were in a long distance relationship for a few years and I moved across the country to be with him after I finished graduate school. Due to such a large distance I opted to sell my car and buy a new one after moving. When I did this my boyfriend helped me out by loaning me some money to help pay the down payment but I have since payed him back.Last week my bfs older sister who lives in another state came to visit and stayed in the house with us. This was my first time meeting her and I thought she was very nice, but I didn't get to know her well. Two days ago my bf and I were out running errands together and his sister called him to ask when he would be back so she could borrow his car to go hangout with her friends in a town about an hour away. He told her it would be a while and she then asked if it was okay to borrow my car. My boyfriend asked me and I told him I was not comfortable with that and to tell her no. My boyfriend did tell her no, I heard the entire conversation.Well a few hours later my boyfriend and I got home and my car was gone. I was shocked and my boyfriend was confused. When we went into the house his dad informed us that he gave my bfs sister the spare key to my car that was in the lockbox because she said she needed to go somewhere. My boyfriend told him that she asked to drive my car and that we had told her no so he didn't understand why she was allowed to take it and his dad said that since my bf helped pay for the car that it therefore was partly his, which meant his sister had the right to drive it as well. I was absolutely livid and I couldn't believe that anyone would do something like this. My name is the only one on the title, insurance, etc. as I am the SOLE owner.My bf told his dad to call her and tell her to bring my car back immediately and she said she would \"be home soon.\" Well after two hours I called the police and reported my car stolen because I was worried that if it got damaged or something then I would be forced to pay the repairs even though it wasn't my fault. My bf's dad and sister were pissed about this and they accused me of trying to get them arrested. They are now demanding that I apologize to them and tell the police it was all a misunderstanding but I really don't want to because I feel that they've tried to take advantage of me. My boyfriend agrees with me but he even said he thinks calling the police to report the car stolen may have been too far. AITA?",

	"body" : "Title makes me sound like I ruined the day on purpose but I promise I didn’t, I just didn’t know how else to put it I guess. Anyway, Me (17m) and my little brother James (9m) live with our older sister Eva (26f). James and I were removed from our mom when I was 10, and Eva did everything she could to keep my brother and I out of the system. I think it was because she was worried we’d be separated and I know she was in foster care for a little bit when she was younger too so I guess that was another reason she didn’t want us to go in. She has guardianship of us now and the adoption process is already going through.So today we were having a family dinner at a relatives house, and some people from our moms side of the family (aunt, uncles, cousins, etc.) were there with us. My aunt ended up making kind of a big deal out of the fact that Eva had me and James help with some of the prep for dinner. She ended up saying something like “you shouldn’t be bossing them around. They’re not your kids and you’re not their mother.”Before anyone could respond I said “well we haven’t been your sisters kids for like seven years now so who do you think was doing her job instead?” My aunt got mad and then eventually everyone was arguing. So dinner was ruined, a few of my cousins even texted me afterwards and said so, and pretty much everyone ended up going home.Eva told me that it’s not my responsibility to defend her, then she said she was sorry for the situation with our aunt. I feel bad because I made Eva feel bad, and because according to most of our family, I ruined the occasion with what I said. They think that it wasn’t the place or time for me to bring up my mother’s situation, even if it was just in response to what my aunt was saying.I didn’t mean to ruin dinner or anything. But if I was out of line then I’ll apologize. I’m just posting because I want to get some unbiased perspectives from other people.ETA:I saw a few people ask why no one in my mom's family helped my sister out when she was 19 and suddenly responsible for two kids, and honestly I don't know. Even when Eva was a kid and she was taken from our mom temporarily, our relatives were given the option to keep her out of a foster home and let her stay with them but none of them took her in.",

	"body" : "I 39f my husband Tom 37m and 2 sons 12m were recently in a house fire and lost our home but luckily we were all out the house when this happened. Tom's brother Sean 40m and his wife agreed to let us stay at his place with their kids while we sort out insurance.I don't like Sean as he believes in a traditional gender roles in a household. We have had issues since he realised I would keep my maiden name at work, which I informed him was none of his business and my personal choice. He works full time and his wife is a housewife. When we had our sons, Sean thought I would quit my job as a doctor and become a SAHM. However Tom became a SAHD instead and then went back to work after our son went to school and doesn't share the same thought process as Sean. Sean clearly disproves of this and me and vocalised his thoughts about the situation.I got Tom to speak to Sean and he has left us alone since, but occasionally used to make comments at holidays and birthdays about it which I ignored. They stopped when Tom returned to work and since then Tom says Sean has grown as a person. Tom and Sean are very close, and I would never tell him to stop talking to him, but I personally interact as less as possible with Sean. My sons' school and Tom's workplace is walking distance from Sean's house which is why I agreed to stay, and suck it up while we get back on our feet as it is temporary.Yesterday was a very hectic day at work, and I was exhausted. My shift ended midday and I went straight to bed. Everyone was out the house; Sean and Tom went to work, the kids were at school and Sean's wife went to see a friend. Sean got home first and woke me up. I was upset and still tired and when I asked him why, he said I should make a start on dinner as it was getting late and his wife was out and not picking up her phone. Usually I do the cooking in the house with his wife, but I was upset that Sean had woken me up and yelled at him to not disturb me. I kicked him out the room and told him I was going to back sleep and he could sort out his own dinner.When I woke up that evening, Sean told me that while I was under his house I needed to respect his house rules. I told him he could've cooked himself, heated leftovers in the fridge or got takeaway. Tom thinks that Sean did overstep by waking me up and making demands, but I shouldn't have yelled and escalated the situation.Update- I didn't expect so many responses and have read quite a few. I spoke to a friend who said we are welcome at hers. I told my husband I was leaving with the kids and he was welcome to join me or stay at Sean. My BIL didn't tell my husband the whole story and said I just flat out refused to cook and then yelled at him out of tiredness, when one of the conditions on us staying was that we would cook and help out around the house. I was upset that my husband believed Sean, but he didn't have the full story. In our culture we place a big emphasis on respecting elders and I know I feel uncomfortable opposing elder relatives on my side of the family, so I get why my husband does struggle. This experience has made me put down my foot though and I have told my husband I don't want our sons anywhere near him. I think this has also been an eye opener for my husband and he has agreed to move out with me, although BIL asked him to stay. When we get our place sorted only SIL and my kid's cousins will be allowed over. My SIL has called to apologise for BIL's behaviour and I have not heard from him at all, he was silent to me and only talked to my husband and the kids. I agreed to move in with BIL as I believed he had changed in his beliefs and it had been a few years since our last fight, but apparently not. Also the house belonged to my husband's late parents and he owns half of it. With our insurance, they have finally ruled the fire as a faulty electrical in our kitchen, so we will get a place of our own by Friday. Thank you everyone for the support in the comments.",

	"title" : "AITA for refusing to sit next to this man?",
	"body" : "I (f, 30s) was riding an almost empty train, there were maybe 5 or 6 people in the whole carriage. I sat in a four-seater (two seats on one side, two across) and spread out my stuff, put my jacket on the seat across from me and put my feet on it so that the seat wouldn't get touched by my socks. If it matters: It was early in the morning and I had been wearing these socks for less than an hour. My shoes are also clean as I alternate two pairs daily to let them dry out between uses.A guy in Innguess his late forties or maybe early fifties entered the train, came straight to me and said \"move your bag\".I was puzzled since there was plenty of free seats to go around, so I asked if he really wanted this particular seat and he said yes. So I picked up my bag, he plopped down next to me and I proceeded to pack up my laptop, drink, jacket, put on my shoes and moved to a different four-seater. I spread out again.Before I could even get my shoes off, the dude was standing in front of me and said \"move your bag\". I asked why. He said that he wanted to sit there. I answered that he had been wanting that certain seat that I vacated for him, so I don't see why he would want to switch seats. He scoffed and explained that it was not about the specific seat but about \"entitled people who think their bags deserve a seat\". I told him that I moved once for him and wouldn't move again. He made a movement as if he wanted to grab my bag and I raised my voice saying \"don't you fucking dare!\". He started lamenting about entitled people again. I told him \"I moved for you. There are hundreds of free seats on this train, sit somewhere else.\"He called me an asshole and went back to his seat. Then he called someone on his phone (or acted like it, who knows) and proceeded to loudly complain about \"entitled bitches\".To be clear, when a train filles up, I of course gather my stuff and vacate seats around me so that others can sit. But I don't see why I should let some rando boss me around and invade my personal space for no reason.Edit: I am having a good laugh about all the people commenting on me putting very clean socks on my reasonably clean jacket, while of course instead there must be only butts on seats, and as we all know, butts are so much more hygienic than feet!I seem to have pinpointed that it's considered bad manners in some cultures, maybe in the US where a lot of users are coming from? In my culture it is not considered bad manners, so I will not be taking your advice of \"keep your damn shoes on!!\" to heart :DMy question was also about refusing to let the sit guy next to me and not across from me, so I am really amused by so many people focusing on that. So, I will be ignoring all shoe-related comments, but of course if your heart so desires, please let it all out!Edit 2: OK now people are sliding into my DMs and asking for pictures of my feet. What have I done :DEdit 3: More serious this time: That's a lot of comments here! I just took the time to read all of them and answer as many as I can, it took nearly three hours. One thing pops up a lot, namely people being scared for me in that situation. Thank you for your concern, I really appreciate it! I would like to address that: The situation was not scary. I would say I am pretty good at listening to my gut and it has served me really well so far. But in this situation, my spidey senses were not tingling, at all. My impression of the dude was one of self-righteousness and some tinge of entitlement, maybe a bit of creepiness, but no hints of danger of physical violence.There were a LOT of people describing situations that started out similarly and were honestly scary. I really hope that all of you are OK!Also, I am updating from the train right now, with my shoes on :P",

	"body" : "A few months ago I (26M) was alone on a long flight, ~6 hours. I had a middle seat between a young woman (20sF) in the window seat, and a woman (30sF) on the aisle. I'm tall and am never comfortable on planes. My knees always dig into the seat in front and it can be quite painful. I usually try to take a walk around the airport before flights to stretch my legs, but neglected to this time. It was Spirit airlines so even less legroom than usual.About half an hour after takeoff I found my left knee inching to the side for the sweet relief of open space -- specifically, the no-man's-land in between seats, level with the shared armrest. But I wasn't paying attention to my knee the entire time. I'll concede it's possible that at some point I was occupying space that rightfully belonged to my window seat neighbor. All was well for ~2 hours.At this point, the woman in the window seat called over the flight attendant. She asked her something like \"Could you tell him to keep his ****ing leg in his own ****ing seat.\" With horror, I understood she was talking about me. I instantly retracted my leg in deep shame. She added something about \"his enormous dick\" -- my understanding was that it was meant to be a snide reference to the idea that spreading your legs is about male genital comfort. But she wasn't speaking very clearly, and the flight attendant (50sF) didn't seem to understand her. The FA asked her some sort of clarifying question but she didn’t answer and eventually the attendant went away.I had been shocked into silence, but when the FA left I frantically began to apologize. But she refused to speak to me. She acted like she didn't hear me. Instead she started furiously texting on her phone (yeah, texting during a flight. I thought it was weird too). Aisle Seat woman said she had some extra space on her side I could use, but then promptly went to sleep. Oh well.I tried again to apologize to Window Seat woman, but again she ignored me. I went from embarrassed to confused. I kept replaying it in my head, wondering why she didn't simply ask me to move my knee instead of calling over the attendant.I started sneaking peeks at her phone. My defense is that I was baffled by her behavior and wanted answers. I'll admit that I was being judgmental, too. Here's why: she spent the last 3 hours of the flight watching tiktoks about shaming obese people and texting someone she called papi. I didn't see all of it but a significant portion was definitely about me; she wrote \"Men really do be too much sometimes\" with a laughing emoji.She ignored me the whole rest of the flight and I ignored her. I got a good but painful workout of whatever muscle it is that keeps your knees together.",

They constantly change and I have never minded any of the ones he’s given me before. They’re all quite harmless, usually food or animal related. But they tend to stick for a while.His family also uses nicknames. They occasionally give me one, too, it’s often the same one my husband uses if it isn’t too sappy. Again, I don’t mind them, in fact I usually find it quite cute and endearing. Until recently.My husband started calling me Lulu - let me give you the context. I was called Lulu growing up exclusively by my mother, and she’s passed away not long before I met my husband. I took her loss pretty hard. I told him that it has a lot of emotional significance for me, and that it doesn’t feel right to hear anyone else say it. He respected that for years, and so did his family.But recently his sister has been referring to me as Lulu whenever I wasn’t there, according to what I’ve been told. And I guess he naturally picked up on it. It’s irritating because it’s not like he forgot about my reasons behind it, he’ll hesitate before saying it. Like he’s trying to see how I’ll react. I’ve reminded him calmly a couple times that I would appreciate he not call me that. There’s plenty of other things I didn’t mind him calling me. Nothing that had emotional weight.The other day he said that he didn’t see the big deal anymore. It had been some years and I should be over it by now. That it’s just a nickname. He said it lightly, like he was trying to let me down easy, but it stung.Maybe I overreacted, but I was hurt by it. I packed a bag and I’m currently staying with my sister. He and his family texted saying I’m doing a lot over a little nickname, and I’m thinking maybe they’re right. I want to get past this because it feels petty at this point. AITA?",

	"body" : "I lost my youngest daughter Joy a decade ago. She left behind her husband and two children who are now 15 and 16 years old. My daughter was very close to her dad and me and when she was at her sickest, she begged us to stay in the kids lives and make sure they always knew she loved them and that we were her family just as much. She mentioned how worried she was that her husband would encourage them to forget her and would try to replace her for them with a new woman. She asked that we leave anything we might have left her to her children. We assured her we would never let the relationship end and that we would make sure they had a good life and would remember her always.Eight months after she died her husband moved his now wife into their home. She had a baby with someone else and was also expecting a baby with someone. At that point he did attempt to make it a package deal where we could not see our grandchildren without treating his now stepchildren as our grandchildren and that we were to treat all future children of his the same. Otherwise we would need to be cut out to give our grandchildren the chance to form the new family bonds without interference from us. That they deserved the chance to have another mother and only see the new children as true siblings.Their lawyer told them we would have a case to get grandparents visitation. We also sought advice on if we were denied access, if we could obtain that. We were told given our close relationship with the children it would be easy to get access through the courts. This led to us getting minimal access but it was all that was needed because our grandchildren were glad to see us and their aunts, uncles and cousins.In the last few years my former son in-law has found himself estranged from his own family and his wife's family are also no longer in the picture and he has 6 children (not counting my grandchildren) in his home with no family or support outside of him and his wife. Now that my grandchildren are teenagers they seek to spend more time with us and their lives have benefitted from it. We admittedly spoil them more than some would like because of the circumstances but they are wonderful children. Their father confronted me recently about his other children and how they have no extended family and are suffering seeing their siblings being spoiled. He also said we had already come between our grandchildren and their siblings because they are not close and have never asked for their siblings to be part of the extended family they have. He told me I owe it to his children to step in and give them love and some of the same spoiling. I told him I did not owe his children anything, and that I would never forgive him for what he attempted to do before. He told me I was cold hearted and callous.Part of me wonders if he's right because the children are innocent. And even though I have never considered them family, they are still young and nothing to do with my former SILs actions.AITA?",

While working there, I became friendly with a colleague, Pete. Everyone in the office would joke about Pete having a crush on me, but I never saw him like that and he never said anything so I didn't pay much attention to the possibility. However, when I started dating my now-husband, things got a bit awkward with Pete. When I quit my job, and Pete and I didn't really stay in contact, but we followed each other on social media. It was a few months later that I saw on Pete's social media that he had started seeing Jen.Pete and Jen got engaged last year, and since my stepdad agreed to pay for the wedding.A few weeks ago, an old colleague  got married, so me, Jen, Pete, and my parents were all at the wedding. Pete was a little over-friendly at the reception, which I put down to alcohol. Later in the evening though, I was outside getting some air and Pete came out and basically propositioned me. I made it clear I was extremely uncomfortable and went back inside.The next day I called Jen and told her everything. She accused me of trying to ruin her relationship, and said  that I shouldn't make the whole situation worse by telling her dad, since I'd already done enough to sabotage her relationships. I agreed, because I didn't feel I had any right to continue being a spanner in the works.A week ago I was Skyping my parents, and they were talking about Jen's wedding. They were talking about Pete and my face must have changed because they immediately asked if something was wrong. I insisted it was nothing but it turned out they'd seen Pete follow me out at the wedding and had their own theories about what he'd done to upset me, all of which were worse than what actually happened. After 20 minutes of them thinking the worst, I told them the truth. I begged them not to do anything about it, since Jen and Pete worked it out, but my stepdad was livid. He called Jen and they had a huge fight, and he refused to pay for the wedding, or even attend.Jen has been calling and texting me, and posting on social media about what a horrible person I am for ruining her wedding, and I've had messages from her friends telling me how awful it was for me to tell our parents after she asked me not to, and saying how I've basically ruined Pete's career, etc. I've tried explaining that letting them continue assuming would have led to worse consequences, but apparently I should have just been able to hide the whole thing somehow.

Nick introduced Josie to the group about 6 months ago.Both Josie and I are mixed race, the rest of the group is white. Ever since we met Josie, she’s made really out of pocket comments to/about me concerning racially related things. Things like asking me if/why all my friends are white, questions about my mother’s (African) background, comments about how I do my hair, like how I shouldn’t straighten it. I always try to steer the conversation away from these topics and laugh it all off but she brings it up so often. Nick says she’s just trying to find a foothold in the friend group but I don’t see why she can’t try to get to know me (or anyone in the group) as people rather than just bringing up this irrelevant thing we have in common. I also pointed out to Nick that Josie and I may both be half African but not the same country in africa, it’s wildly different cultures, even if I was raised in an african culture which I wasn’t, it wouldn’t be one similar to hers so really it’s grasping at straws. And that’s to say nothing of the fact that it makes me uncomfortable.Anyway, over the weekend we all had a boat day and we were having lunch. We were talking about school and I mentioned that one of the schools I went to had predominantly Asian students. Josie asked if there were any black students in my year and I said yes, but I didn’t know them very well. She then asked if the reason I wasn’t friends with them is because they thought I wasn’t “black enough”. I don’t know if it was that comment or the countless ones before it but I just felt so angry that she would once again take a conversation that everyone was participating in and make it into a race thing for no reason. I said, “no Josie that’s not why we weren’t friends. Frankly the only person I’ve ever met who is obsessed with my racial identity is you. And just so you know, it’s really creepy.” Josie tried to stutter an apology but I said the only apology I was interested in was it not being brought up again, and my bf jumped in and changed the topic.Nick later took me aside and said I’d really upset Josie and she was just trying to bond with me. He said she has trauma (he didn’t got into detail) about her race and by humiliating her I’d made her really uncomfortable. I told him that that wasn’t my problem and I’m not going to be Josie emotional support “coloured” friend, and if he thought I should be then I wasn’t sure what that said about how he views me.Nick is now mad at me for insinuating he’s racist and two friends have taken his side. I don’t think I was wrong for wanting Josie to respect me like everyone else but evidently people think what I said was harsh. Was it?",

I have no idea why they did this, I think it’s because the 8 year old is falling behind in his reading level and they wanted to keep things “fair” between the kids. I think that this is ridiculous, as Callum is a very smart kid already, and he needs that time for homework and relaxing since he doesn’t have that much freetime to begin with.Amanda let me know that she expected me to enforce the “reading rule” when Callum is at my house. I told her that I would not. She said that it was unfair to Callum’s half siblings that he could just leave for my house and not have to follow the rule, while they had to follow the rule no matter what. I told her tough luck, it’s my house and I make the rules, not her.Well now, Callum is thinking about not staying with her at all anymore due to the increasing strictness of her and her husband’s rules. She told me that it’s all my fault that he doesn’t want to be around her anymore because I was so lax with the rules. I’m pretty sure I’m in the right here, but I though it might be a good idea to get some perspective, so AITA?",

	"body" : "I (31F) am currently doing my residency in internal medicine. It’s brutal, but I should be finished in December. I have five cousins on my dad’s side. Most of them have non-health related careers, but Andy (32M) is a chiropractor and Kayla (26F) is a nurse practitioner.Now, my dad’s family has had at least one or two doctors in every generation. My grandpa and his brother were both family medicine, my dad is a urologist, and one of my aunts is a pediatrician. When I was in high school and college, my grandparents used to talk about how I would carry on the tradition and be the first doctor in my generation of our family. My other cousins were very clear they weren’t interested.Last weekend, we had an early Easter celebration/ egg hunt with my dad’s side — some people are on call this coming weekend, so it made more sense to do it early. At the table, my grandma was asking about my residency and how happy they were to see me as the first doctor of my generation. Andy butted in and pointed out that he and Kayla are also “doctors.” I was frankly annoyed and a little tipsy, so I told him that chiropractor and NP aren’t the same thing as a physician, at all. Chiropractics is pseudoscience and can even be dangerous for patients. Nursing is a great career and I’m proud of my cousin for getting her NP, but an NP is it’s own distinct thing. Andy got pissy and called me privileged and arrogant. Kayla kind of took my side, but then said something about how NP school is just as challenging as medical school and that it’s “only devalued because nursing is a historically female career path.”My grandpa interjected to tell them both to take a seat, that they weren’t doctors and shouldn’t be claiming to be such. After lunch, Kayla pulled me aside and un-invited me to her private practice grand opening next month. She said she only wanted people who would cheer her on to attend, and she felt it was best if I skipped. I didn’t really want to go anyway — I have very limited free time — so I said I respected that.AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for deleting my cousins precious wedding photos?",
	"body" : "I (17M) agreed to take wedding photos for my cousin Sarah's (26F) wedding. She wanted me to take photos of her getting ready, our grandmother putting a family heirloom necklace on her, the first look, the wedding, the reception, etc. There was also another photographer (a friend of the groom) who was taking photos of the groom and his side getting ready, and he was also taking photos at the wedding/reception. Since I wasn't a professional photographer by any means I told her I would only charge $50 for the entire day. And when I say entire day, I mean it. From 8am until 10pm I was with her taking photos and basically being harassed by her, her bridesmaids and my aunt. She was a full on bridezilla the entire time, not just to me but basically everyone including her husband. It was a long day to say the least.So after all of that I went home, edited the photos, and copied them onto individual USB drives for people she might want to give them to. I texted Sarah a couple of days later to let her know they were ready and that I would happily meet up with her to exchange them for the $50. She never responded. For the next three weeks I texted, called, got in touch with her mother (my aunt), and even stopped by her house to try and get the photos to her. She evaded every single attempt.6 months passed since the wedding and I was at the movies with my other cousin (19M), who was Sarah's younger bother, and a couple of our friends. He tells me, \"By the way, Sarah was wondering when you were going to give her the photos. She said she would pay you the $10 if that's the only reason you're talking so long.\" I was livid. First, it was $50. Second, that was the deal from the start! I told my cousin this and said to tell Sarah if she wanted them she needed to contact me within 2 days so we could meet up, with the payment, or I was going to delete them.This might come as a shock considering the title of this, but she never contacted me. The 2 days passed, I deleted the photos and erased the USB drives. Less than a week went by before my aunt called me in a fit because I \"threatened\" my cousin into paying me when she \"didn't have the money\". I told my aunt that she has had a little over 6 months to pull together $50 (which she knew was the agreed upon amount), that she refused to respond to me no matter what I tried, and that it was too late now because the photos were gone. My aunt, uncle and a few other relatives have been refusing to talk to me or my parents because I deleted, \"precious photos that can never be taken again, all because of greed\" (literal quote). My mom thinks I should apologize and am just being stubborn. However, my older brother thinks I held onto the photos longer than I should have, and that I should have deleted them after the first week of trying to get into contact with her and being dodged/ignored.So, AITA for deleting my cousins wedding photos?",

We planned to test them along with Maya after we finished up some other wedding plans yesterday.However, when I came home from work to see Leo yelling at Maya, the box the samples came in wide open on the living room table, and Maya arguing with him.I asked what was happening, and Leo angrily told me that while we were both at work, Maya had some friends over and they ended up eating almost all of our cake samples. I was shocked and asked Maya why the hell she would do something like that.Maya said that she needed a pick-me-up from what she was going through with her husband and invited her friends over to comfort her, which turned into them eating the cake samples after one of her friends noticed the box on our kitchen counter.My shock turned into anger, and Maya tried to defend herself by saying it was just cake. I told her that if it was just cake, then she should have no problem replacing it.Maya refused, because the price was way too expensive for something tasted shitty anyways. Leo backed me up on having Maya pay to replace it, and we argued until I said that if Maya can't cough up the money, then she'll just stay at my FMIL's house because there was no way I was having someone so disrespectful in my house.Maya thought I was bluffing until Leo repeated my sentiment and went to go pack her things in a huff. When she came back out, I handed her some cash for gas and told her to get the hell out.Presumably after Maya got to her mom's house, my FMIL called me to scold me about kicking Maya out, and that I was cruel to do that to her in her time of need.Also, my FMIL was also irritated that I sent Maya her way since she had let Maya into the liquor cabinet and ended up drinking some expensive whiskey that belonged to my FFIL so now they're arguing about that.",

I also have a son, Jack (15M) from my previous relationship.For the first 18 months that I knew Lucy, she was in love with junk food. She would use the money she would get from babysitting the neighbors kids to buy cookies, chips, ice cream all the time. It was very unhealthy how much of that crap she was eating. I tried to politely encourage her to switch to something healthier that still tasted good like yogurt that she would always respond with \"you're not my mom\" and \"stop controlling my body\". Because of this she's put on a lot of weight.Anyway about 6 months ago, she got into an argument with a boy in school. They called each other names and he ended up calling her a hippo. That made her really self-conscious and she's been trying to improve her health since then. She threw out all the junk food we had at home and tries to exercise 3-4 times a week. She's been making steady progress and I'm happy that she's been taking care of herself.My son however has recently taken a liking to Doritos chips. He doesn't eat a lot of it. Maybe a packet every other week. He mostly eats it in his room so Lucy hasn't seen him eating them. But a couple of days ago he was watching a tv show downstairs and he decided to eat his chips. I was cooking in the kitchen but then I heard an argument so I ran out to figure out what was going wrong. Lucy was mad at Jack for eating chips and told him to throw it out because she's trying to lose weight. My son said he can eat whatever he wants. I tried to calmly tell Lucy that  Jack is allowed to eat in a common space and if what he's eating is tempting her, she can nicely ask him to put it away or she can go to another room until he finishes if he declines her request. That just made her angrier and she accused me of \"playing favorites\" and \"sabotaging\" her progress. This pissed me off because I've done nothing but support her these past few months. I firmly told her she's almost 18 and she needs to grow up and accept that not everyone will follow her diet especially in their own homes.She cried to her mom who's now blowing up my phone calling me a bitch for not supporting her daughter.

I wasn’t sure about getting back in contact, but they seemed genuine, so I tentatively went ahead.

He met me at the door and told me to act like we’re a happy family in front of his old friends. I, being hungry as hell at this point, made a beeline for the buffet. He promised me dinner, and by god I was going to I have it.I tried to blend into the background, until I got to chatting with some other folks my age, my father’s friend’s kids I assume.

Apparently, what I said had gotten back to my father’s friends who are now being very cold to my father. He was angry with me because “it wouldn’t have been a big deal to just lie and save face” and now he’s in hot water with his university friends.I muted him and went to bed.

Most of this is in the last two weeks.My MOH (26F), M, was in charge of planning my bachelorette party, which I wanted to be a surprise. We live in a city, but none of us live downtown, so I was hoping for a hotel room downtown and having a fun night out with friends, maybe a brunch. Most of the bridal party live locally, but two girls flew in for it.When M picked me up 2 weeks ago on Friday , I was excited to see where we were going and what we were doing. We ended up going to M’s 1 bedroom townhome and spent the whole weekend there. There are 8 of us, so it was cramped and we kept running into issues with only 1 bathroom. On Friday night we had games and ordered pizza, Saturday we had a mimosa bar, went shopping, ordered food, and watched a movie, before parting ways on Sunday. It wasn’t the bachelorette party of my dreams, or a particularly fun weekend, but it was ok, and I appreciated it.Last weekend, my fiancé (32m), J, had just returned from a work trip. I hadn’t caught him up to speed on the party, because there wasn’t much to report. But when he returned, we were chatting and I told him about the party. He looked confused but said nothing else that evening.The next day, I got a message from M asking to meet up to talk about “something.” M revealed that J had given her a significant amount of money over a year ago, with the intention that it was used to pay for a bachelorette party. It would have been enough to pay for the entire bridal party to do a week long vacation out of town, including airfare, hotel, food, drinks, and fun. I wasn’t expecting this type of event; a weekend downtown would have been wonderful, and even though the party at her home wasn’t what I hoped for, I was fine with it because I got to be with all of my friends. She, instead, used the money to pay off credit card debt and hoped that no one would notice.I told her I needed some time to process and went home. After talking with J about it, I decided, that the best action would be to remove her from the wedding. I came to this decision because I don’t feel I can trust her and don’t want her to be standing next to me at my wedding. I slept on it overnight and sent her a text saying this on Monday.Since then, I have been getting texts from her mom and boyfriend telling me how awful I am for doing this since I didn’t need a big party and M was able to financially benefit . My mom is also against removing her from the wedding, as she’s like a sister to our family and it would be tragic for me to get married without M there. The rest of the bridal party is split, with half saying I shouldn’t have kicked her out and the other half agreeing with me. M has called me crying because she already has her dress (J and I paid for all dresses) and she can’t wear it anywhere else.At this point, I want the wedding to be over with so I can be on my honeymoon and not have to deal with these people.So, was my action too extreme?

I'm WFH, and he lots her job. Because she has three kids, she made a big stink to keep the entire second floor to her and her kids. I got \"stuck\" with the creepy, musky basement because of her.Only it turned out to be a dream. I'm very introverted, and nobody wanted to go down to the creepy, unfinished, spider-infested basement. So it worked. I spent every month since trying to finish the basement. I finished the floor with epoxy. Fixed the water heater on my own dime. Got a split-unit for heating/cooling. Exterminated. Then I installed some nice track lighting. Got a mini-fridge and foos ball table. Now it's my own personal clubhouse.Until recently, when I noticed someone was stealing my energy drinks and messing with my game consoles. Nobody confessed. So I bought a lock and key for both doors, gave my dad the only spare (it's his house), and locked up on Thursday, so I could go to an office meeting.  That's when we found out it was my nephew, because he left his stuffed toy in there and apparently whined all day until my dad got home and let him in. Now my sister is raising hell about how I shouldn't get so much space to myself since I don't have kids; that I don't pay enough rent to justify it; that nothing in this arrangement is fair and she is demanding that I leave the space open as a family room.  That was not the arrangement though. The basement is my room, and I'm the one who spent all that time and money fixing it. Nobody wanted to be there until I was finished with it.Things got heated and I called her kid a filthy brat, because he is. He gets mud everywhere. Never washes his hands. And he's broken just about every console she's ever gotten the kids. And now she wants me kicked out of the house. AITAH?Quick Update: So after we all cooled down, I did talk to my father. He said he has zero interest in letting the kids down there. When my sister tried to protest, he pointed out to her that the place is still not safe for kids. There are still rat traps. Exposed wood. He pointed out that she, herself, kept screaming about there being \"mold\" (there isn't). So he doesn't want ANY kids down there. And unless she's willing to pay for an inspector to check (she's not), she has no say. So that shut her up really quick.Then she got into it with me for the \"filthy brat\" comment, and I was about to apologize because I was heated. It was messed up.  Only dad hopped in at that moment, and chose to have a serious conversation with her about the youngest not washing his hands. He apparently ruined several leftovers in the fridge last week, and \"slimed the butter\" (I don't know. I don't WANT TO KNOW), which my dad did want to bring up anyway. Because the kid has a problem, and won't bathe. But I stepped out at that point because it sounded like he was mad.  Very few things make my dad mad, than having to throw away perfectly good food. It's one of his triggers. So. Everything is shaping my way. For now.",

We met in elementary school and she’s always had a learning disability, but she didn’t know that there was a preventable cause. My other bridesmaids noticed her crying, and the evening ended up being about her. We skipped out on going to a bar in the limo I had hired because she was upset. I thought about it all today and ended up emailing her to tell her that she took away an important moment from my life. I feel bad about this happening to her, but even though she didn’t always know it’s been going on for her whole life. If this was a recent thing she found out about or it was some kind of deadly disease I would feel differently, but she was sitting on this for months before bringing it up at an event that was supposed to be special to me. You only get one bachelorette and mine was totally overshadowed. I felt really hurt that she did that, and told her that I didn’t want to have her in my wedding if that’s how she’s going to treat me at a time where the focus was supposed to be something good in my life instead of something sad in hers. She could have waited a few more weeks until after the wedding if she wanted to have this conversation. She’s still invited to the wedding but I don’t want her to be a bridesmaid after this. I was just texting my cousin (my maid of honour) and she disagreed with me doing this. She said that it sucked that we didn’t go to the bar, but this other friend has already paid for her dress so I should just let her stay. My fiancé supports my choice, but I wanted another opinion. AITA?Update: for those wondering I had actually seen her on two occasions since her diagnosis, including getting coffee one on one a week after it happened where she could have told me. It was the fact that she waited until my event to tell me and then derailed it that had me so upset. I hadn’t considered the fact that everyone pre drinking might have set her off. After reading a bunch of comments here I called her. I asked why she hadn’t told me before and she said she was still trying to process when I had previously seen her. She didn’t realize she was going to cry so much and distract everyone and ruin the mood. She said she felt really horrible about doing that and that she hadn’t meant to ruin the evening. I apologized for acting on my own hurt feelings and asked if she’d be willing to consider still being a bridesmaid. She said she really wanted to still be in the wedding. I don’t have the budget to have another bachelorette party, but I realize that I was only making that loss worse by hurting an old friend in addition to losing out on an event. I was definitely attributing her behaviour to malice when it was actually bad timing. Back in high school she did a similar thing to me because she was jealous of the attention I was getting as part of a competitive choir, but she’s grown up since then (we’re 23 and 24 now). I overreacted, and I honestly appreciate the tough love from this sub. It made me reconsider what I was doing and probably just saved a friendship.",

I moved to England a few years ago to study at my dream university. I ended staying there with my now husband, Lewis (30m).Sadie got pregnant at 18 with Tyler, her boyfriend at that time. Tyler and his sister ended up in a car accident a few months after she announced she was pregnant. He and his sister didn't end up surviving the accident. Sadie was very upset during the rest of her pregnancy. My parents were luckily there to help her out.After her babies were born, my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer because of all his smoking. My mom had to help my dad out a lot and didn't have as much time to help Sadie with her twins. Sadie reached out to me a few months ago and asked if we could send her some money every month so she could hire a babysitter for her kids and help my dad. Lewis and I agreed since we were financially stable and could afford it.She was very thankful to us, but a few weeks ago, she reached out again and asked if we could move back to Canada to help with the twins. This time, Lewis and I refused. I feel like it's too much, we've built a life here in England and my husband has a demanding job here and it would take him a while to find another one in Canada. My mom has sent me a few texts begging for me to come back because they could really use the help. Now, I feel kind of bad, AITA?Some info on Tyler's family: Tyler's sister is actually his half-sister. They share a dad. His sister is over a decade older than him and has raised Tyler since he was 11. His mom died while giving birth to him and their dad died of a terminal illness. His sister's mom just wasn't in her life.",

	"body" : "My sister (29f) got married last Saturday. The ceremony was beautiful and I enjoyed myself as much as someone who is famously not a wedding guy could. The dramatics were not quite as enjoyable.I (27m) hadn't seen my family in a few months, and we've only had a handful of phone calls over the course of those months. It's never on purpose that I pull one of these disappearing acts, it's mostly out of habit. I've been fiercely independent for most of my life and I get easily caught up in whatever I'm doing at the time that makes it hard for me to remember to keep those not in my direct line of sight in the loop. My mother is the same way. (It's also nice visiting around times when big events like this are going on as my mom is prone to hovering whenever I'm home, and this takes some of the spotlight off me.)I had been in Ireland around 8 months prior to flying in last Thursday. I was originally there to spend two weeks with my best friend who, thanks to the aforementioned one track mindness I possess, I had unfortunately grown apart from within recent years. Ours was a friendship that had started since we were 14 and was one of the most important relationships in my life for over a decade, and I wanted to put more effort into it so I didn't lose it. He was spending time overseas as to reconnect with his heritage since his father's passing, I was already traveling, and my stay obviously turned out to be a lot longer than two weeks.It also turned into us getting married. Funny how life works out.About two weeks before our trip the states for my sister's wedding, I sent out a mass email to close family letting them know that me and my husband were married. I wanted to assuage any possibility of us 'stealing any thunder' right from the get go. My mom replied that she was hurt that she wasn't told sooner or allowed to be there, which I understood.It seemed her mood flipped by the time we met in person, however. Rehearsal dinner was on Friday, and that was where we all met up for the first time. My mom was overjoyed to see me and my partner and spent a large part of the night telling stories about she had always predicted there was something different about my friendship with him compared to others I was close with in high school. It was a very sweet moment. But at the end of the night, my sister pulled me aside and asked if we would not wear our wedding rings to her ceremony.I was confused, so I asked why. She said I was taking the attention off her and she was already bitter than I was 'hijacked' her rehearsal dinner. More family might take notice if I wore my ring tomorrow and cause a similar incident. I refused. Like I mentioned before, the ceremony was beautiful but she didn't speak to me for the rest of the weekend and we ended up leaving the reception early.AITA?",

My MIL (58f) has always hosted Christmas ever since I've known him.I've always made lasagna for Christmas and other special occasions. I'm essentially the family lasagna maker, and I honestly don't really mind since I love to cook and bake.However, last year my MIL decided to make lasagna based off what she saw me doing when she was at my house and a receipe she she got off the internet. I was surprised that she prepared a pan of her own, but didn't say anything and even got a small piece.It did not taste good, and it was barely touched whilst mine had almost half gone near the end of the dinner. That infuriated my MIL, and she wound up doing a rant about how everyone loves me more than her and tried to throw my lasagna in the trash. I say tried because it mainly ended up on the floor.Michael and I quickly left after that, and my MIL has not apologized for it since.Yesterday she called me to confirm what I was making for Christmas this year, and on her list of things I should make was lasagna.I politely said I wasn't going to make lasagna due to last year's incident and I'd be happy to make anything else. my MIL wasn't as polite and called me vindictive for refusing to make the lasagna over a small mistake.I just refused again and it made my MIL angrier so she told me that unless I show up with lasagna in hand, she wouldn't let me be at  the Christmas celebration.My husband says its easier to just make the lasagna to keep the peace, and I shouldn't hold my MIL's mistake that she made out of anger against her.Word got to my SIL and BIL from my MIL and they're saying I should also make it even if it's just half of what I would usually make.",

Some of the recommended pairings require expensive ingredients like caviar that I can’t justify buying on an average day but my birthday seemed perfect. So that’s what the theme was - a molecular tasting party. I put together a total of 15 “courses” but they were very small, just a few bites each. There was also a moderate amount of other snacks laid out and cocktails.My husband and I both had a really good time. We ranked the pairings, had drinks and played card games. I thought everyone else enjoyed themselves too.This afternoon, we got a text that was presumably sent to the wrong group chat that said, “can we just be honest and say that the whole thing was weird? She’s like this every year. The rest of us just go out, how has she not gotten the idea yet? It’s rude”Another person replied, “at least last year she made an actual meal. I’m mad I even brought a gift”I sent “wtf?” back and the whole chat has been silent since.I don’t know what to think. It really hurt my feelings and I don’t even feel like they like me at all if they talk about me like that but also… if I’m making people feel like they’re forced to participate in things they think are weird, that’s a selfish thing to do too and maybe they’re right.",

Ana and her family have been blocked and I will no longer be in contact with her.It was also brought up to me by another user that their was a similar post posted a few weeks ago from a hosts perspective. This is NOT the same post. My situation happened really recently (allot more recent than whatever the previous post was) I’m shocked to hear this has happened befor, but yeah it’s  not related to ours hahaFinally I’ve had a few comments about my dog being “certified” that I want to clarify. I am not from the US so I’m unsure what your guys process is like, but all I mean is that Bailey has gone through the required testing, training and registration to ensure she is legally aloud to be classified as a service animal :)I just want to start by saying I’m pretty sure I’m not the A-hole. But my friend and her family are pretty certain that I am. Please bear with me, I’m just wanting some clarity over this situation to make sure I’m not crazy.I (24 f) have epilepsy. I have a service dog (fully certified) who is trained to help me with my seizures. I have been diagnosed since a child, and I have had my current dog Bailey for 4 years now and she is the bestest girl around. (Before Bailey I had a previous service dog who we had to retire due to age… but having a service animal is by no means new for me). With her being a service dog she is obviously always with me.I have a core friend group who hangs out quite often. My one friend; let’s call her Anna) (also 24f) always makes really weird and almost passive aggressive comments about me and Bailey? Ex; dogs shouldn’t come to restaurants, I’m inconveniencing people, etc. she doesn’t get that I legitimately need her for my own safety. It’s not just for show.My seizures are really regular; for context I actually get two different kinds. My “small ones” are petit Mal seizures. This essentially just looks like I’m zoning out and staring into space. Quite often people who don’t know me wouldn’t even connect this. My “big ones” are my main concern; these are focal seizures where I fully lose consciousness. This can happen a couple times a day for me so it’s obviously really important that I manage it to the best of my abilities.Anyways. Our friend Anna wanted to host a games night/appy night type thing at her house. When we there she lost it on me. She told me it was increadibly disrespectful that I showed up with Bailey without asking for permission first. That I can’t just assume people will be happy with a dog always being around. That I should have just stayed home if I couldn’t handle being out for a few hours without Bailey. I tried apologizing and pointing out that I assumed she knew I was bringing her since I’ve never gone anywhere without her. That set her off more. The guys were finally able to calm her down but her “compromise” was I had to put Bailey in the backyard.I was an idiot and said fine because I didn’t want to inconvenience anyone more or continue stirring the pot. Bailey went out side and I returned inside with my friends.I ended up having a seizure, blacking out and smashing my head on the floor. I had to go to the hospital because of how hard I hit my head.I guess my friend group absolutely handed Ana her ass calling her hateful, toxic, and a jealous witch. I guess she was trying to say that I passed out for the attention and I got my way like always. Long story short no one wants her around anymore.Since this happened her, her sister and mom have been blowing up my phone, calling me the ass hole and demanding I fix this situation and it’s honestly getting to me.. so Reddit.

	"body" : "I'm a 48-year-old single mom to two kids, we'll call them Rachel and  Vik. Rachel recently turned 18, and she has a lot of chronic health issues she's been struggling with since she was little. We've been blessed that she has a lot of good periods, but right now she's having some trouble, likely due to the stress of next year's graduation and all that entails. I've been kept pretty busy making sure she stays as healthy as possible.I think Vik has always resented the extra attention his sister receives, which is understandable. I've always tried my best to make sure he has special time devoted to him, too, but I'd be lying if I said Rachel's health hasn't taken precedence over everything else.About a month ago we had the good news that Vik will likely be graduating early due to  academic excellence. I was so happy and congratulated him, but I noticed that since then his behavior seemed to be worse. He was more moody, short with me, not eating meals I made.Last week I took Rachel to the doctor's over a sinus issue. While we were there Vik called from school saying he was in a lot of pain and could I take him home early. I told him he knew I was at the doctor with Rachel. He got pissy and said some not-so-nice things about me favoring her. I'll admit I jumped to conclusions and thought that this, combined with his other bad behavior, meant he was just trying to get attention, since his early graduation news hadn't given him enough. I told him because of his attitude I wasn't picking him up early at all, and after Rachel's doctor visit was over I went to work as usual.When I got home, everything seemed normal. But when I called the kids down for dinner Vik didn't come. When I checked his room I quickly realize he's genuinely sick. I immediately rushed him to the doctor's and apologized profusely to him for not believing him initially.I tried to explain that his behavior recently is why I assumed he just wanted attention. He said if it was Rachel I wouldn't have made that assumption, though I assured him this wasn't true. Since then he hasn't really talked to me. Was I really being the asshole?

They both have high paying jobs and earn around $350k between them. Maddie and I are middle class. I own a small house and Maddie goes to a private school. Maddie has a good life but it doesn’t compare to her cousins.My brother and Jen rented a house for us and paid for the rental, all of the food, and all of the activities. The only thing I paid for was gas when driving myself and Maddie to the house.I also have to say Nate and I don’t get along very well but I have a great relationship with Jen, mostly because of how they are with the kids. Nate tells the kids they don’t have to be nice to anyone, never encourages them to share their toys, and doesn’t discipline his kids. Jen is the opposite. She constantly tells the kids to share with their cousins and will punish them if they’re being rude to the other kids or adults.Now to the vacation. They rented a 3 bedroom house. Nate and Jen had the master bedroom, I had the second bedroom with a double bed, and all of the kids were going to share a room with 2 bunk beds (4 beds).The first night was pretty rough. The kids brought tons of toys but refused to let Maddie play with them. Jen came in and told them that before they left she told them they’d have to share their toys so they either share or she takes them away. They were a little rude but mostly fine the rest of the night. The second night Jen went out to dinner with an old friend and Nate and I were home with the kids. We were getting the kids ready for bed and an argument broke out between the kids because Laura and Danny decided they don’t want to share with Maddie and told her to sleep on the couch. I expected Nate to tell them that the bedroom was for all of the kids but he told Maddie that she either has to sleep with me or on the couch.I asked if he was serious and he said yes and that his kids weren’t comfortable sharing with Maddie and since he paid for the house, he has a right to kick Maddie out of the room.I told Maddie to get her bag and that if she doesn’t have a bed, we’re going home. Maybe an hour after we left Jen came back and asked why Maddie and I left. I told her what happened and she asked me to come back and promised that she’d take care of her husband and the kids because she wants her kids to have a good relationship with their cousins.I said no and shortly after we got home I got a call from my brother yelling at me for causing a scene, creating problems between him and his wife, and being ungrateful for a free vacation.

We both work high-stress jobs, with high incomes and no children, we are frugal and spend our money on savings and trips.In our relationship, I plan our retirement, keep track of finances, host friends/family, arrange gifts, make appointments, and plan our vacations (we travel a lot). For his part, he does laundry and cooks and does the dishes more than me. He gets along well with everyone and is the more “easygoing” one.On our trips, I’ve asked my husband to help me with tasks ranging from helping me plan beforehand, to finding an Uber. Usually he ignores me until it’s too late and I have to make the decision, or he makes mistakes (getting an Uber to the wrong place, or forgetting beach towels I asked him to bring). Mistakes aren’t a big deal, but he places the blame for them on me.This issue is not new to us, for our wedding I did 99% of the planning and he promised in return that he would plan a honeymoon. Right before the wedding he looked up a Costco package that was almost twice as expensive as we’d agreed to spend, and that didn’t have guaranteed spots. What I really wanted him to do was not to find an all-inclusive unaffordable trip (that we didn’t go on) but do something that was tailored to us.My husband also has a twin brother that often comes along with us. Like my husband, his twin doesn’t help plan and he had never thanked me for planning trips for us. He behaves like coming on the trips is a gift to me. Outside of this, I’ve tried to be his friend, but I feel no reciprocity. I get him gifts for his birthday and holidays, text and call him, and include him (i.e. asking him if he wants me to write his name on a Mother’s Day card when he hasn’t helped pick a gift).Right now, we’re all on a flight back from Hawaii where I researched hotels and flights, put together schedule, booked hikes and dinners, rented a car, etc. When I brought up the fact that they complained a lot and never said thank you, my brother-in-law said that he told me the “sunset was nice” and that is the same as a thank you.When I told this to my husband and explained how upset I am with both of them for not helping me (not yelling but definitely not in a calm way) he told me to f*** myself. My husband also said that if I cancel future trips that I’m no longer invited to my in-laws Thanksgiving (the one thing his mom plans).I’ve already planned and booked an elaborate three week Christmas trip to Italy for the three of us (they say they want to go, while doing nothing) but I just feel exhausted. At this point, I’m considering canceling it entirely, canceling my own portion, or canceling one or both of their portions and going solo. Would I be the asshole if I took one of those paths?TL;DR: Burned out wife unsure about how to proceed after planning numerous unappreciated vacations for husband and brother-in-law, thinking about canceling an upcoming trip.",

	"body" : "I (24M) work for a very prominent company and get paid a lot better than my girlfriend (23F). We both moved to a different state for my job, and she ended up with a very toxic work environment with a boss who was sexist and homophobic. She hated her job and ended up getting a new one that pays a lot less than her old one, and has asked me to take on the responsibility of paying most of the rent.Since we have been in this new state, she has done most of the cleaning. I contribute by doing the dishes sometimes and washing the laundry (she folds it). She is the only one who cleans the bathroom, the kitchen, and the only one who sweeps, mops, and vacuums along with other random chores here and there.It’s been about 8 months since we moved and everything was fine until recently. The other day she asked me to vacuum the living room and I said I didn’t know where the vacuum was. Since then, she keeps bringing up how I need to do more of the housework, but I feel like because I contribute more to the rent she should be responsible for keeping the apartment clean. I also do the dishes sometimes and do stuff she asks me to do.I’ve done more of the dishes since she brought it up (doing them maybe once a week instead of once every other week). She now leaves cleaning tasks for me to do without telling me about them and then gets upset when they aren’t done. If she just asked me to clean those parts of the apartment then I would. She claims that I should know what needs to get done and just do them myself without making her bring it up first. Eventually she gets frustrated and just cleans by herself.I’m also tired from working when I get home and I just want to relax or finish my work. She works the same amount of hours as me, but her job is much less demanding than mine so she is less drained by the end of the day. She does pay for our groceries and my gas sometimes as well as other little things here and there.I don’t think I’m an asshole for expecting her to contribute with the housework since I contribute more financially. AITA for letting her do most of cleaning since I pay for most of the rent?Edit: I just want to answer some of the more common questions I’ve been seeing. We both work the same amount of hours each week. She has agreed that her job is less demanding than mine. We split the rent 60/40 so I pay about 60% of it right now. Her health concerns aren’t an every day thing, but they come up a few times a month. I know where the vacuum is now. After receiving the comments I have, I really need to sit and reflect on how I am acting in this relationship. I recognize now that I have truly and deeply made a mistake with thinking paying more of the rent means that I should do less of the housework. I really love her and I value her so much, and I’ve clearly done a horrible job at showing that.Update: I appreciate those of you defending me in the comments, but I’ve come to the conclusion that I am the asshole. Please don’t say anything negative about my girlfriend since she has not done anything wrong. She’s tried talking to me about this and I have not been receptive. I’m sorry for not responding to people, I was having a conversation with her. There’s nothing I can do to make up for the past 8 months, and I was an idiot to think that my financial contribution was great enough to warrant not doing any chores. I would do anything to keep her, and I messed up thinking that this was a small issue. I hope she forgives me for not taking her concerns seriously, and I hope I can create an environment where she feels comfortable confronting me in the future if I’m EVER acting like this again. It shouldn’t have come down to strangers on the internet telling me I’m an asshole to realize this, but thank you all for the wake up call so much. I am never going to dismiss her or all the hard work she puts into this relationship and our life together again. Im going to start doing the majority of the chores for the time being. I’m also going to start paying more of the rent since I do make more. I don’t pay more of the rent to have a housekeeper, I pay more of the rent because I love her and I want to support her.

That's when her ugly side rared it's head again and she caused a scene and was thrown out. I refused to let her visit us at home, my husband agreed. But she rang crying and apologizing. She said she was just overwhelmed about being a grandmother and her emotions got the better of her.Against my better judgement, I relented and said okay. When she first held him she looked at me and said he was beautiful! I went into the kitchen to get us a drink and then I could hear my husband telling her to get out! I went back in, she started yelling he needed to get baby tested because he doesn't look like anyone in their family. He kicked her out. She took to SM and told everyone that I cheated on my husband and that my husband needs to get a DNA test to prove he was the dad. She got alot off attention for that. So I made my own post and said I'll get a test when she gets test for her son! That just made everything worse! She rang my husband up telling him to take it down. He just hung up on her. Everyone divided and questioning my husband paternity since she had such a strong reaction to it. Now even my husband is starting to wonder and making me feel I went to far and I'm thinking AITA for saying that?",

	"body" : "Me and my sister used to be close, but when I was 5 and she was 7, I got sick up until I was 15. Because I was sick, my parents often stopped her from doing normal things on my account; at first, I was ok with her doing kid stuff. But at one point I got bitter and kind of guilt-tripped my parents and her to let her stay with me, but I did that up until I was 12; after i noticed that it was leading to  a strain in our relationship and her hating me, I tried to get back on her good side because she was no longer enthusiastic to stay with me like before, when we would play games and she would sing and do things with me, I tried to convince my parents to let her do stuff because she would come back from school then spend 5 -7 hours with me then go home and that cycle would would repeat itself. but my parents still insisted on it and thought I was being brave, even though I would beg them to let her have a life.When I turned 15, I had surgery and was doing better, but I was still dealing with some side effects from the drugs I was taking, but that only lasted for a year. My parents had finally let her do things that she wanted to do. This was like midway through her junior year. But the damage was already done; she had stopped communicating with me and my parents. Like when we'd sit down to dinner and she'd only say one word to my parents and then lock the door to her room. and she did not have any friends; she told my aunt, and my aunt told my parents, because she was worried about her mental health. My parents tried to do family therapy before she left for college, but she still didn't communicate (she can literally spend a whole month without saying a word to anyone).When she went to college, she cut off our parents and me. She changed her number and everything. Last year, after doing some research, I found her on Instagram (she seemed much happier there), found out her university, and applied there. I wanted to rekindle our relationship now that she seemed to be in a better mental space. Last semester, I contacted her through her university email and told her we could meet for coffee. She ignored all of my emails. This year, I decided to be more direct, so I went to her student organization and told her hi; she ignored me, but her friends asked who I was, and I told them I was her sister, and they seemed surprised because she didn't mention me. She then told me we should go to a cafe. and she chewed me out for picking this university (she referred to it as her safe place). I am now feeling like I may have gone about this the wrong way, but at the same time, I just wanted us to be close again.AITA?",

Natalie and I have been friends for a while, but we haven't been able to hang out as much since she graduated last year and has been working. This was my first time seeing her new place, and our first time spending the night together (before anyone gets the wrong idea, there are absolutely no romantic or sexual feelings between us).Now, as a guy without a penis I am unable to enjoy the wonders of pissing standing up most of the time. STPs scare me and so I simply sit. However, when I shower I can pee however I'd like and it just goes down the drain and washes off my leg if I aim badly! I shower every night before bed and I basically always pee, it's just really satisfying for me. I don't really talk to my friends about my peeing habits, but my whole family pees in the shower as well and I just assumed it was normal.Last week, me and Natalie were hanging out with some of our friends. Somehow, we started talking about peeing, and so of course peeing in the shower came up. Many of my penisless friends agreed with me that it's so nice to be able to stand for once, and many of my penis-having friends even agreed as well. However, not everyone felt that way, and there was a bit of an awkward silence afterwards.Natalie approached me later and nervously asked me if I had peed in her shower, and I said yes. She got really quiet and the whole thing got really awkward. She kinda shuffled away and we sort of avoided each other the rest of the evening. Later, one of our mutual friends texted me to tell me Natalie was really uncomfortable to learn that I peed in her shower, and she was reconsidering whether she would ever let me stay with her again. I texted her about it directly and apologized, but she hasn't replied yet.So AITA for peeing in her shower?edit: who reported me to reddit as being in crisis im just trying to pee here ",

	"title" : "AITA for choosing our family dog over a friend hard on his luck?",
	"body" : "Me (32m), my wife (30f), and our 2 daughters (both under 5) live in a decent sized apartment, not grand or anything of the sort but big enough for us and for us to host another person for a limited amount of time that it would not be a burden.Recently a friend of mine (28m), that I've known for a few years from an old job, is going through a divorce has asked me for a place to stay. I talked it over with my wife and she has no problems with him staying with us.When I told him that he could stay he was so grateful, but then told me to let him know once we have gotten rid of our dog and deep cleaned the home as he has a severe dog allergy, we never knew about this as it has never been an issue, we always hung out at a mutual friends house, work, the bar, or double dates at restaurants where no dogs are.I told him that we would not be able to get rid of our dog to accommodate, as he is a part of our family, getting older and that it would honestly devastate our girls and us.He is now running around bad mouthing us to our friend group for taking back our offer for him to stay with us and choosing a dog over his health. I have been receiving multiple calls saying that I ATA for not helping him now.TLDR: I'm choosing our family dog over our friend staying with us due to his divorce.Edit: I've seen it asked, me and my family are American from the east coast, very pet friendly area, but we no longer live in the USA as of now due  to my work, and currently live in a not so dog friendly country on the other side of the world. Dogs here are not looked at as they are in the USA, many view them little more than pests and don't understand viewing one as family here.Edit 2: Thank you all for the responses, as I said we do not live in the US at the moment and I know back home that there would be no second guessing if I was an asshole in this situation. I have talked with a few of our friends and some now are at the least indifferent, they still really don't get \"valuing something like that over a person's comfort. \" But they at least acknowledge as a difference in world upbringing. While others are still upset that I would not do this for our friend. The friend in question is going to be staying with someone else, they wanted to stay with me as I was the only one in the group that had a spare room that could be used as a small bedroom. As I said, whenever we would meet up with others it was always in public or st their home, we have had maybe 4 or 5 people over at our home, most of which are also from the US. One friend did visit us back when we were first moved over but was uncomfortable around our dog and asked that if we would keep him away while he was there. Many have said they do not wish to hang out in a place that they view as \"unclean\" due to a dog living there, which I did not understand as many have pets, mostly cats, but again understanding the difference in world upbringing.",

	"title" : "AITA For Telling My Daughter She Can’t Move 1,000+ Miles Away To Live With Her Girlfriend?",
	"body" : "A friend at work pointed me to this to get some more advice/points of view on my situation.I (46F) am the mother to two wonderful children, Andrew (16M) and Nicole (21F). Nicole was very bright as a child and excelled in her classes, and she headed into college with a plan to get a Master’s at least. I never had to worry about her doing well or hitting milestones, but the last few years have been very surprising. She became a bit withdrawn in her teen years, more so than I realized until now, and after her first year of college she suddenly moved out from a relative’s home and got her own apartment. Then, after her second year of college (last May) she told me and her father (58M) that she was dropping out and might return in a year, but wasn’t sure, and that she was incredibly stressed and depressed and had been for years. It felt like it was coming out of nowhere.Last fall she got a full time job and started talking about how she was happy and finally in a good routine and that she loved working. I was glad things were at least going well for her now, but still hoping she’d return to college soon. One of the biggest recent bombshells she dropped on me though was a month ago when I drove to visit her. We went out for lunch, and we started talking about this friend (25F) of hers. Eventually, my daughter admitted to me that she was a lesbian, and that she and this girl had been dating since January and that she FLEW TO MEET HER WITHOUT TELLING ME OR HER FATHER! Mind you, she flew over 1,000 miles to see this girl that she had NEVER MET and had only called and video chatted with for a few months. I was shocked and angry, but all I did was gently scold her for not telling me, but that I’m glad she’s okay and that she had a good time with her girlfriend. I’m very new to this whole thing with my daughter, as I thought she was interested in men, but I’m willing to support her because I love her.The problem now is that she told me earlier this week that she intends to move within the next year and a half. She says it may be sooner rather than later because things are changing with her girlfriend’s living situation and she wanted to give me a heads up. I told her absolutely not, that she can’t move in with someone she’s only been dating for a couple of months, especially not when she’s moving several states away. All of her family is HERE, including me and her father and her brother, and her three living grandparents. I told her she’s too young and she can’t move that far away from us just for a girl. She told me that regardless of her girlfriend, she’s been wanting to move far away for years and that her girlfriend’s state was on a list of potential places. She said she loved being there when she visited and can’t wait to go back. She says I’m being unreasonable by asking her to stay and that she hates it here and feels like she “can’t be herself”.Am I being the a-hole here? I don’t think she’s old enough or mature enough to leave.Edit because someone asked- my daughter didn’t ask for money. She almost never asks for money, she’s like her father in that way. She’s almost completely financially independent. I have her on my health/dental insurance to help her out, my mother pays her monthly phone plan because she insisted on doing something for my daughter, and my daughters grandfather on her father’s side pays her car insurance, and my daughter goes to her father when she has car troubles because he has a lot of experience with cars. My daughter takes care of all her other needs on her own.Edit- my child’s father is NOT my husband. We never married. We have not been together since she was born. I would have left him earlier had I not become pregnant. I regret being involved with him because he is why I was introduced and became addicted to drugs. I do not regret my daughter. Please stop calling me a homophobe. I support my daughter. I am just apparently ignorant to some things about being gay.Edit- I am no longer talking about or answering questions about my addiction. Most of you are making baseless assumptions and disgusting accusations and I won’t entertain them. I tried my best to be a good mother and get clean. That’s that. I may not have been the best person to have custody of her as a child, but neither was her actively abusive father who stalked, abused, manipulated, and intimidated me the entire time I’ve known him.Edit 3/24- I can’t keep up with the comments. I’ve also been banned from commenting because I apparently broke a rule. I’m going to try to talk to my daughter about all of this when I see her this weekend. I want to be a part of her life even if I think she’s moving in the wrong direction.",

	"body" : "I (F30) is single and childfree by choice. I date occasionally but no long term relationships. This is due to many reasons like I love my freedom, I want to enjoy my life unencumbered with responsibilities and want to really focus on my career.My older brother (M34) got married when he was 26. He has two kids (F7, F4). They had a traditional household. He wanted a partner who stayed home and looked after the family while he earned. She had apparently dreamed of being a homemaker and taking care of children.But during last couple of years she showed signs of hating it. She wanted to study more and work outside. Build something of her own. But my brother refused to step up or help. I warned him once but he told me it's none of my business how he runs his household. I kept my mouth shut since.His wife left him a month ago. She just wrote him a letter saying she can't do this and want to explore her life. She left kids with him and basically vanished. We have no idea where she is.Thing is my brother doesn't know how to do even the most basic things. He is the kind of guy who never changed a diaper or toasted bread. The moment my brother found that his wife left, he called my mother who rushed in to save the day.  She thought it was short term and my SIL would be back, but she hasn't. My father is unwell and needs her home soon. They live hours away.My brother suggested she take kids home with her. My dad said no. He is retired and they are both getting old. He does not want to have kids in the house full time, taking up her time and energy.Since that was a no go, my brother asked me to either move in with them to help out or take kids in with me. I refused.From what I see, he is a grown adult and these kids are his responsibility. I made a choice to live the way I do and I do not want to sacrifice my life for his choices.My family is pressuring me onto this saying stuff like how my brother does not know how to take care of kids, the little girls need a women in their life, how family helps family etc.My brother is calling me cold hearted for not even trying to help him.AITA?Is she okay: In the post I had given no one knew where she is based on info I was given by my mother. She told me they had communicated with SILs parents as well.Hearing that she had taken all her documents and per her note, I trusted she had gone somewhere where she can study and make something of herself.But a lot of comments had me questioning about it all. Many of you wanted me to file report as missing person. What I realised is, me and my parents not filing it made sense. We know and trust my brother. But why didn't my SIL's parents file a report? They should have been more suspicious, right?So I called SIL's mom. She didn't sound worried or sad, so I was more suspicious. I asked if she knew where SIL is. She said they don't know, SIL did not say anything to them etc. I told her I would be filing report today then, so we know she is safe.Her mom panicked at that and told me not to. That SIL will come home when she is ready. I told her I have to file report unless I know she is safe. She kept insisting I don't have to. It was very suspicious.5 mins after my call, I got a call from an unknown number. It was SIL. She was panicking and more or less begged me not to file a report. Turns out she was in another state, crashing with distant family.  She really did want to go to college and my brother was not letting her. She had a huge fight with him about all that the week before she left. She was really depressed and feeling stuck. Her parents loaned her some cash through a church friend who also helped her go away.She begged me not to file report saying he will sue her for child support and she can barely support herself and go to college.I told her abandoning her kids was wrong. She was crying when she said she know and hope they can forgive her. She really couldn't live this life anymore. Leaving them was the hardest decision she ever made but she felt it was better than taking them and letting them starve with her. Atleast here they have home and family.I did ask why she couldn't just divorce my brother then. She said she did not have money for lawyer or anything. No home to return to. She is not proud of it but she just couldn't stay and fight.She didnot tell me where exactly she is. Didnot want to risk it. Asked me not to give her number to my family.I did tell her situation with her kids. She just said my brother will figure it out. She cannot help in any way right now. She will come back to her babies when she can.",

I turned to her and asked her to speak for herself and that I do not agree that mom skips in front of me.We started arguing and I said that this checkout does not give priority for pregnant people and parents so she should wait in line like everybody else and if she is unable because of a baby she shouldn’t bring the baby to the store with her. The older lady started ranting how she has never seen behavior like this before, how I will understand when I have my own kids to which I said ‘if’ then she started telling me how my life will be horrible if I don’t and how I lack empathy and will regret my decision to which I told her to fuck off because I was tired of her bullshit. The older women and a mom then just kept talking about me and my behavior between themselves and the mom then complained how she feels uncomfortable existing in a public space because of people like me.I have absolutely no problem with kids. I don’t hate them, they never bother me and parents in general here are able to control their kids so they are never a problem. However in this particular situation a child was calmly sleeping a stroller and I just don’t see a reason why she should have a privilege to skip a line just because she popped the baby out of her vajayjay. Sure if a baby was screaming or she was carrying him in her hands or literally any reason but ‘I’m a mom so my time is more important than yours’ I would let her skip without a second thought. I’m just tired of parents feeling entitled just because without any adequate reason.AITA?Edit: I never actually told the old lady to fuck off but due to the better term in English I chose to use fuck off here instead of trying to explain the phrase I used because it’s hard to do without knowing the language and culture.

She said Steve is your name, I don't see the problem, but I eventually got her to see things my way.A couple months go by and I had heard her say it periodically, like \"Steve can pick what to have for dinner.\"  Finally today she did it again and I said \"babe, I know we talked about it before, but can you please use 'your dad' when talking to the kids\" and she says \"it's totally subconscious, it's not like I mean to.

If you hear me and respect my wishes, it doesn't need an excuse or hedging, you can just say OK.

	"body" : "For context: My(24M) brother “Luke”(31M), his wife “Emma”(28F) and their son “Kyle”(4m) moved to my city last year because Emma got a new job. They would occasionally ask me to watch Kyle because I work from home with very flexible hours. I personally do not like kids at all but I was happy to do it at the time because I wanted to help them, it was not that often(maybe once or twice every 2 weeks) and Kyle was very well behaved.Now the issue started near the end of last year when Luke decided to change careers.(He was previously working remotely as well) His new job required him to go to work a lot more often and make substantially less money. This left them depending on me more and more to take care of Kyle. It went from once or twice every 2 weeks to around 3 days out of the week. To make matters worse, Kyle’s behavior changed drastically. To be completely honest I can barely stand the kid anymore, constantly running around and screaming while I’m trying to work and just overall being a little shit.My SIL Emma was over the other day picking up Kyle and made some comments about getting rid of some of the “dangerous” furniture in my house like tables with glass edges and stuff so that my home is safer for their son and made a joke about baby proofing my house because they're planning to have a daughter. This pissed me off but I didn’t say anything.The situation hit a breaking point last Friday when I was talking about the 1.5 week long trip I was going on with my girlfriend on the 15th (Me and my GF like to travel somewhere nice at least once a month, we could not the past couple months because of Kyle but I promised my GF we would go somewhere exotic for valentines). Upon hearing this they got pretty mad saying who was gonna take care of Kyle, that I need to stop these “childish trips” and that I need to take more responsibility because “I’m an uncle now”. Im not gonna lie, after hearing this I fucking snapped. I said that their demon child isn’t my responsibility and I’m not just gonna give up my life because they fucked without a condom. It got pretty obscene from there and some horrible things were said. They left and we are no longer on speaking terms. My parents and Emma’s parents are on their side and EXTREMELY angry at me for “refusing to pull my weight”. My parents said that this is my duty and I should be sacrificing everything to help them. It’s honestly got me really down and I've cried my eyes pretty much every day since seeing those messages from my family. I’m starting to wonder if I really should be taking more responsibility.

	"title" : "AITA for excluding my \"adopted sister\" from family photos?",
	"body" : "This is a throwaway and I'm using fake names.I am 26F and my \"adopted sister\" Ally is 14F. The way we're \"related\" is that my younger brother Michael (24M) has been with his wife Maya (24F) since their freshman year of high school. Maya and Ally had a really bad home life and my mom is very much a \"my home is open to everyone\" type of person, so over that year Maya began spending more and more time at our house, eventually bringing Ally over as well since she was always babysitting. By the time Michael and Maya were 16 years old, Maya basically lived in the guest room and Ally spent after school, most weekends, holidays, and summer vacation at our house.My mom and dad say that they love both Maya and Ally like their own children. My other siblings (18M and 16F) also treat her like she's a part of the family. Even after Maya and Michael moved out, Ally is still at their house the same amount, if not more than she was before. Now to preface, I have nothing against Ally. She's a good kid and I make an effort to be nice to her. However, I've never really liked how she was foisted into our lives. She's not actually adopted and she *still has parents and her own family*. Yet my parents spend so much time and resources on her, it's ridiculous. Everyone else has started unironically calling her their daughter or sister and I've refused. I just don't consider her to be family.Anyways, I got married recently, which is where the issues start. I invited Ally to the wedding, of course, and she came with all of my other family. When we were doing pictures of the wedding parties, I decided that I wanted one with all of my immediate family (so my parents, my siblings, and Maya, and Maya and Michael's daughter). My mom brought Ally up to come take the picture with us and I was forced to tell her no. My mom started to get upset but then Ally said it was okay and sat down by herself. My mom isn't a very confrontational person so she didn't make a big deal of it but then everyone else realized that Ally wasn't there and they got mad as well.Ultimately, we took the photo how I wanted it because they \"didn't want to do this at my wedding\" but my entire family is pissed at me now. My mom said that Ally cried when she got home because I don't love her, which I don't. I feel like they forced into a position where I had to do an asshole thing by forcing this kid onto me. I don't think I should have to consider her family if I don't want to. AITA?Edit: After the ceremony but before the reception, the wedding party and both of our close family's took photos. I did not include Ally in this photo session and she sat with the rest of the regular guests waiting for dinner. I did not intentionally exclude her from any of the photos taken. I'm sure she's in some of them from throughout the night especially because she was there with my family. I hope that clears some things up.Edit 2: Maya and Ally are sisters. Sorry, forgot to explicitly say that in my post.Final edit:The people who are agreeing with me are starting to convince me that I'm wrong. To the people calling my parents nasty things in my pms or just saying that they aren't good people: you're dead wrong. My mom is the most caring and kind-hearted woman in the world and I should have made that more clear in my post.To be clear, I am also not a monster. I don't mistreat Ally. I get her birthday and Christmas gifts every year. However I am starting to understand that I did do a shitty thing by publicly excluding her at my wedding because I wanted it to be how exactly how I imagined, especially because my mom was apparently blindsided by my feelings.I was 16-18 when Ally started coming around a lot and I didn't form the same bond everyone else did. I never super liked being around kids, including my sister who by all accounts behaved way worse than Ally ever did. But I recognize that she's become a part of our family. And I think I'm going to make more of an effort to get to know her properly, because I do know she is very mature and intelligent for her age.Also, I don't mean to minimize what Maya and Ally have gone through. By saying she wasn't physically abused, I moroso meant to explain why she hadn't been legally removed from her mother's house. She does have extended family that actually cares about her but they live at minimum an hour away so she stays with my parents the majority of the time.Thank you for all of your input.",

	"body" : "So I recently just moved into my new apartment complex less than 60 days ago. There are only 4 units in my complex, two downstairs and two upstairs. I reside downstairs in the second apartment. Everyone here has lived here for at least 5 years whilst the oldest resident has reside here for 8. Everyone knows everyone and has been good friends with each other for as long as each one has been a resident. Everyone in my building has children besides me majority are single mothers, I am the only man.Apparently there is an unspoken agreement I at first had any knowledge of between the rest of the tenants  that the hallway door is to never be locked. No one ever locks the hallway door. That is until I arrived. From my knowledge no one in the building has a hallway key just the keys to their apartments. The cost to replace a key is $70 for each quoted from my landlord. I just finished up my place and have officially moved in for about 3 weeks now. Each time I leave and come back from my complex I always lock the hallway door. It's always been a hit to lock all doors behind me. My neighbor that works night shifts has arrived home for the past couple of weeks to a locked hallway door which is a surprise given that the door hasn't been locked for years. Apparently everyone lost their key their first year or so living in the complex. I will hear continuously knocking and banging until someone comes to open the door. The first few nights I was awaken and got up to unlock the door. After the first week I've since stopped and my neighbor will be up to unlock it to let our neighbor in. If my neighbor isn't home or doesn't wake up to come to the door she will knock and bang on every window and yell until someone comes open the door.Yesterday my neighbor ask I I could pleaseleave the door unlocked given it has always been that way and would like me to continue doing so. I expressed that while we live in a dangerous neighborhood ( rated one of the top 5 most dangerous in our city) Is feel more safe knowing strangers can't enter the building. Whilst she understood my concerns she assured me no one ever comes here but residents and invited visitors and my safety is not to worry. I had to beg to differ. She then asks would I mind lending her my hall key so she can make a copy and let other make their own copy from hers. I politely declined because I wasn't comfortable with that. She offered to pay me to make a copy myself in which I also declined.For the past week my neighbors has barely spoken to me we usually tell each other good morning and chat a little or just a hi and bye even but not even that nowadays. My neighbor whom volunteers at the food bank in our community would come back with goodies and share with everyone in the complex. She has since knocked on my door to deliver me a box as she usually would every Wednesday. I don't care for the food but for the change in this routine leads me to believe I may have upset the rest of the tenants and I honestly don't want any bad blood.",

It's gotten uncomfortable at this point, so I've started leaving early to go home or hang out with other friends.

My sister is bi and suggested our city has a Lesbian bar and I should take them there to see how they react. To be clear, this bar does openly welcome straight and cisgendered people so we weren't violating their space.Anyway, there was a basketball game last night and this bar sets up a game night whenever our local NBA team is playing. I suggested we go there to watch the game and most of the group came along. They immediately got really uncomfortable when other women started flirting with them at the bar and offering to buy them drinks. It lasted about an hour before the girls all took off. A couple of the other guys and I actually ended up staying, the women there were all really cool and we made some new friends.The group chat this morning has been a big argument. The girls all say it was fucked up that we took them there. I told them to stop acting homophobic. The other guys in the chat are mostly supporting me and saying they have no leg to stand on since we always constantly agree to join them at gay clubs and never complain. I actually want to start going there regularly on game nights, it's a really fun atmosphere and everyone we met was awesome.AITA?",

A few days before my birthday, she calls me from her job and tells me she canceled our reservation to go on a “date night” with her boyfriend. When I asked her why, she said it was the only day they could get a table for the restaurant. I told her she had made a promise to spend my birthday with me and now she’s breaking it. She then said to get over it and spend the day with my gf. (My gf works for a cruise line and is out of country until July) I ended up spending my birthday alone and made a post on social media calling my mom out for abandoning me on a milestone birthday. My family is now divided. Half are siding with me, and the others are saying I’m selfish and I went too far making the post. I haven’t taken it down yet. So, am I the asshole here?Small disclaimer: this is a pattern of her’s that has been going on since I was 12.

My mom (43f) came into my room the other day asking me if I want to go and stay somewhere on that Saturday night so she can have her man over to do the deed. I was obviously upset by this and told her I planned on coming home as I wanted to sleep in my own bed. She then persisted that I go and stay with a friend because she didn’t want to have to go out to do whatever (my twin siblings would also be out the house they are 5 and staying with my grandparents). I said it is not my problem that she wants someone to stay over and I will be coming home to sleep. She then told me that she would be loud and make sure to wake me up to hear and made it clear she did not want me home. This could have been a joke but either way that is not normal to say that to your child right? For context I have been hearing my mom have sex with her boyfriends at the time since I was around 10 years old and I had complained multiple times at hearing this. I obviously don’t want to come home and hear my mom having sex but I also want to sleep at home as it is my bed and I too live there. We’ve been going back and forth on this and now I’m going to stay somewhere else but I still feel like she is in the wrong for asking me to leave in the first place. Idk what to think I understand where she is coming from but still?Edit: I feel like I need to clear some things up. First of all no I do not pay rent because simply I cannot afford to. I live in the UK so there is no underage drinking. I cannot simply just move out that is easier said then done and when I got to uni next year I do plan on leaving and my mom also agrees that then will be the best time for me to move. I am still in full time education and have a part time job so let’s not be so harsh on the fact that I still live with my mom. I understand the privilege of living at home rent free but it doesn’t take away from the fact that my own mom wants to get me out the house so she can have sex with someone. Some of you asked about the boyfriend and yes he does have his own home it’s just in another city and I’ve personally never met him.",

He was fine with it.He has a daughter Leah (F25). His wife died when  Leah was 10 years old and I met him when she was 15. I didn't meet her till after a  year of dating. She was a sweet young adult and we got along great. I did not move in with Sam till Leah left for college though.Leah got pregnant last year. Her boyfriend did not want to keep the baby but she wanted to keep it. He broke up with her. Leah moved back in with us cause she could not afford her lifestyle without him. She worked as a teacher and he was the bread winner.I had concerns about how she was going to raise a child on a teacher's salary by herself. I suggested getting him to pay child support. She did not want that. Sam thought I should stay out of it. Fine.But once she had the baby around 4 months back, Leah seemed to realise having a baby is not the sunshine and rainbows she thought it was. She barely got any sleep during the last four months. All the while Sam was helping her with the baby while I did almost all chores myself.Now her leave is ending. She did not want to leave baby at daycare or with a nanny. Sam and I both work as well.She asked if I could stay home with the baby. I said no. First, it is not my baby, and I never wanted to raise a child. Second, I have work.She asked Sam who asked me to do it instead. I refused stating the reasons again. Sam couldn't stay home because he earned more than me and covered more bills.I asked why Leah can't stay home with the baby herself. She said how she was young and had to build a career. I said many people take breaks to raise kids, and she broke down crying about how she was so tired all the time being a mom and she needed something else in her life too.Sam feels bad for her and thinks we should help her. I suggested she pay for nanny with her income but Leah doesn't want strangers looking after her baby.Both of them are pressuring me to stay home with baby so she can go to work. I am standing firm on my decision.Leah said yesterday how she wished her mom was alive since she would have had her back.

	"body" : "I (F45) have a Fiancée (M55) who is retired military officer. I own a successful company I started 7 years ago and have a small staff of 25. I worked my way through college, paying as I went. Therefore, I graduated in my early 30s with a double major in Accounting and Business Management. I am very proud of that.For a little background: I worked hard for my degrees and have zero debt. I know it took me longer than the typical student going full time to college after high school. I worked full time to pay as I took classes. I went to Jr. College first then finished at a 4 year. I took 2 classes per semester...for a long time. But I finally made it!! I have been \"teased\" that jr. college isn't the same as going 4 years at a major university. Well, I am proud to have done both and feel the education I received at Jr. college was excellent.I worked as an Accountant for some large corporations, as well as programming and IT. I started my company doing similar support to large and small companies alike. I have a wonderful staff. I manage the contracts, kick off meetings, Sales and Consulting staff. I also do some of the consulting and most of the sales/contracts. My sister is my office manager, and I am blessed in so many ways to have her.I was dating my now fiancée before I started my company, and we recently got engaged. Everything seemed to be perfect, except he keeps introducing me as a bookkeeper. No disrespect intended to them or the profession. My issue is that I have worked hard to get where I am. I am an accountant, Graduate with a double major, and successful business owner.He could pick almost any other \"title\" to introduce me as, but he chooses \"bookkeeper\". I have asked him many, many, many times in private to stop calling me a bookkeeper as it implies to my clients and business associates that he doesn't respect me or what I have accomplished. He said he doesn't see the big deal or the difference and continues to do so. I recently pulled him aside and asked him to just introduce me as a consultant at the event we were going to. While there we were talking to a prospective client (for my company) and he says, \"she has come a long way for a bookkeeper\". I know my face had a full blush at that, excused myself and walked away. We had both driven there, so I got in my car and went home. (We both own our own townhomes). I sent him a text to let him know I was leaving and would talk to him later.He thinks I am over-reacting. My family thinks he is a controlling ass that doesn't respect me or women. I'm not sure what to think now. He seemed so supportive when we are together, but not when we are around other people. He tends to treat me like a subordinate, nice kid, playing with the adults. He does talk down to me in front of my family, but I always assumed he was 'joking' badly.So...AITAH for leaving and over-reacting?EDIT: Update/ I had a conversation with him, after a few days. He feels I'm lucky to have him and need to listen to his advise more and not over-react. The attitude along with reading everyone's replies (Thanks!) I have called it off with him. I need someone who is proud of me and caring. My family responded by buying champagne. LOLEDIT 2: Had another conversation with the ex-fiancée. \"Now that I had time to get my emotions under control\" He was willing to let it go. I laughed and told him I'm fine and so are my emotions. I told him about the post and that he should read the replies. Lets just say he was not happy. I did say no name were used, just Me, I and He. Here is the TOTAL SHOCKING PART: He wanted to know what I was going to give him for his help with MY Company. After the shock wore off, I handed him a dollar and walked away. Told the family and my Brothers wanted to pay him a visit. I told them I handled it and gave him a dollar. We all laughed, went to the store and got more champagne.  God I love my Family!!!!",

	"body" : "I (26F) live in England. I own my home and understand I am fortunate, but I also worked hard for it. Any money I received or earned while working part-time till graduation went into my savings account.Most people on my street are social housing tenants; I'm still determining what that is, but they've explained that you're eligible for the scheme if you're on a low income. It's more secure than the private sector as you mostly get assured tenancy's even though there are different tenancy types.For a while, I got on well with my next-door neighbours \"Emily\" and \"Ben\" they also have three kids (13M, 9F, 4F), but soon I started experiencing a lot of problems from next door. I work from home often, and I could hear shouting next door constantly; Ben is 5\"11, 145kg and quite loud and intimidating, and I could hear their kids screaming and crying. I had to ask them to lower their voices daily, and I even explained that I work from home.The next set of problems revolved around the 13-year-old son. I spotted their son climbing over a wall to get into my garden to get his football back which at first I ignored it. Then after it happened ten times, I finally decided to speak with his parents, and I can't remember what I said entirely. Still, it was something like, \"Hey, I just wanted to have a word as I have seen your son, <insert name here>, trespass 11 times to get his ball from my garden. I would appreciate it if you could get him to stop as he is trespassing, and if he just came round to the front and knocked on my front door and asked for his ball back I would happily collect it for him.\" The neighbours apologised and said they would make sure their son doesn't do it and knock.A few days later, their son did it again while I was in my lounge. I walked into my garden, which made him jump and spoke with him. I told him I'd seen him trespass to collect his ball on various occasions. I told him I had talked with his parents and that trespassing is a crime, and I would appreciate it if he could just come to the front and knock in the future. He didn't say anything and just went back into his garden. I informed his parents, and they apologised, but it continued.I got fed up with it and decided to invest in CCTV finally. I wrote a letter to residents on my road to give them a week's notice that CCTV is being installed at my address, and it will cover my entire garden and it will also cover my doorway. I also wrote that I'm getting a ring doorbell camera. After installing CCTV, I thought it would stop the kids from trespassing. It continued. I saved the footage, filed a police report against the son for trespassing, and sent all my evidence to the police. I knew there was a strong chance that nothing was going to happen but I just wanted the son to have some responsibility.When my neighbours found out they were mad AF with me and since then our relationship soured.

	"body" : "My wife and I recently bought a new house. After we closed on the house my sister came to see it and asked when we would like her husband to install a ramp. The ramp is for her son, who is in a wheelchair. He and other niece's and nephew used to come over to our old house all the time to hangout with our kids. My sister husband, who works in construction, previously installed a ramp in our old house as well as my brothers house because he and my sister want their son to feel welcome in everyone's' home.Our previous house was very standard and installing a ramp was easy. This new house however sits up high which means it needs a very long ramp. After measuring according to specifications we've realized that we cannot install a ramp unless we get rid of some of our homes features.Our front yard is a tiered garden. It is my wife's favorite feature as she is an avid gardener. We probably would not have bought this house if not for the garden as we had our eye on another. If we built a ramp leading to the front door it would cover the majority of the tiered garden.The only other option is the side door (we do not have a back door). The side door however leads directly into the driveway that goes up alongside the house to the garage in the back. If we built a ramp in this area it would make the driveway too narrow for many of our vehicles. We have very limited parking on our street so we would basically lose half our driveway parking. I also wouldn't be able to get my old muscle car in the garage where I had planned on storing it.I've explained this to my sister and she is unhappy about our reasonings. Especially the one for the front door. She says she gets the parking problem, but the garden is just a cosmetic thing and not worth making her son feel unwanted or like a second thought.Other family is also unhappy because now our house is unusable for family parties since nephew won't be able to come. We do family parties on a rotating system between me and my brother since we're the only ones with big enough homes. I said we could do the family parties out in the back yard in the summer. It's big and has a lot of trees and a large canopy area where we can put some nice outside furniture and barbecue. The garage also has a bathroom that is accessible, so it shouldn't be a problem for nephew to come so long as everyone hangs out outside. They think it's unreasonable because it will be too hot to stay outside the whole time and people will need air conditioning. If they go inside to cool down nephew will feel left out. My brother also doesn't like that the burden is now on him to always host. Especially since he will always have to host for thanksgiving and Christmas which are the most hectic holidays.",

	"body" : "Throwaway because relevant parties are on reddit.I(49F) have a daughter \"Susan\" (21F) who was hospitalized for an extreme medical emergency late last month. Susan was there for four days, I visited every day until the last which happened to be on April 1st. Her roommate and other friends also visited.On the 1st her roommate called me crying, saying that Susan's conditioned suddenly worsened and she passed on. In hindsight I should have thought something was up but hearing that in the moment turned me into a sobbing wreck. About a half hour later Susan and her roommate came into my house and shouted \"April fools!\" Turns out she was allowed to leave the hospital and that was how she decided to tell me. I did not know it was possible to be so relieved and pissed at the same time. I called this joke horrible, screamed at her and told her she was NOT welcome in my house for the foreseeable future.Apparently Susan thought Easter would be an exception. I was hosting this year with a few relatives and she came in(she still has a key) I made her give it back and once again told her to get the hell out of my house and while she persisted and was very stubborn about it she finally left crying. The rest of the gathering was understandably awkward.It's not like I will never forgive her or that I'm going No contact or anything like that, but I am just too hurt and angry to speak or look at her right now to have any sort of discussion about what happened. She tries to call and text me every day but I ignored most of them. Our family is split between acknowledging that there are consequences for this while several others say I need to move on and just forgive her because she still hasn't fully recovered and needs my support. I get that but I think she is getting plenty of support from other people right now for me to be a necessity, and if she wanted my support she would not do something so damn cruel. She was always a bit of a jokester but never like this, it really does not sit right with me at all to just bygones be bygones right now but some relatives including my parents say I should. I hope I can get some unbiased opinions on this please apart from family.",

I got to chatting with another couple and mentioned that I had 4 boys. She said something like, \"Oh, you poor thing. I wanted a girl too but he (pointing to her husband) didn't want to have a 3rd.\" I told her that I didn't try for a girl and that if I wanted a girl we could have put that in our adoption paperwork but we didn't have a gender preference. I had no strong desire for a girl and love having sons so she has no reason to feel sorry for me. It rubbed me the wrong way that she said \"poor thing.\" Like my boys aren't good enough for me and she said it right in front of them. They already have to field questions about being adopted. They shouldn't have to feel bad about their gender too, you know?Anyway, the lady got upset, told me I was being rude for no reason, and walked away. I spoke to my SIL about it and she also felt I didn't handle it correctly. She has 3 girls and 1 boy and said it is just a normal thing people comment on.

My mother, a woman who could find the love in her heart to babysit a honey badger, refuses to watch Darius at all because of his behavior. My father will take all of the grandkids out to fish every few months, except for Darius because he's to tempted to throw him out into the lake and drive off (his words not mine.)On Monday, I got a call from my sister who panicked because she got called into work. Darius was out of school and her babysitter was not available. No one else in the family will watch Darius so I told her to drop him off and I would watch him. It was a nightmare. Darius was mad he had to spend his day off at my place. He refused to do anything I offered, made a mess in my bathroom, harassed my dog, and had a tantrum because I would not let him use my work computer to play games.By lunchtime, I was frustrated beyond all belief. I made him mac and cheese and he demanded I take him to wendy's. He refused to eat and eventually dumped his bowl of food on my floor. At that, I just kinda lost it. I didn't yell or get aggressive at all. I just  sighed and asked him if he realized that everyone in the family literally despised him. I explained that he was at my house because grandma and grandpa cannot stand him, and in fact refuse to let him come to their house because he acts like a little shit. I won't lie, I got pretty brutal.He started crying and locked himself in my bathroom until he came out and sat and watched tv till my sister came and got him. I told her what happened and I and her got into a massive argument as well. She called me cruel and I told her that she's to blame and he would have learned eventually.My family is split on this. My dad thinks \"the little shit deserved it\" while my siblings have mixed opinions. My mother has told me she's staying out of this but if I feel the need to apologize do it and move on.What do you people think?Edit:Ok, the early consensus is I'm an asshole. That's fine.A little info. We've talked to Diana about this before. My parents sat her down and told her they will not watch Darius because of how he behaved and that she needs to do something else.

He took some food off her plate to try a bite and she responded by shaking her finger and saying \"You need to ask!\" He said \"I'm sorry, you're right, I should ask,\" and then a few minutes later, reached over to my place setting and took some of my food without asking.I didn't think it was a great example for our daughter considering it happened moments earlier so I said \"You didn't ask. You just did the same thing to [daughter].\" He said, \"I assumed you were done eating.\" and I said \"You assumed. But just ask me.\" so he handed it back to me, said \"Can I have some of your garlic bread?\" and I shared. Very calm, normal exchange.Because this was a non-issue and I was not upset at the situation, we tried to use it in marriage counseling as an example of how to communicate in certain situations, mainly, when I say something hurt me and my spouse wants to explain how he experienced the event instead of apologizing.It became an issue when he only wanted to give HIS side of the food story in counseling. Later that day, I asked him calmly again, if he would like to share his side to see if it changes my perspective. I said \"I can't argue with your experience since we both agree on what happened\" - and to my surprise he indicated we did not agree. He told me he took the garlic bread from my place because he \"got it for both of us.\"I knew this was nonsense as I order from this restaurant frequently and know how much garlic bread comes with the dish. I got insanely angry, because we argue constantly about how things happen, so I stormed off. Later, he came to me and said \"I'm sorry, I thought the garlic bread was mine and I was wrong.\"So by this point, I'd been told that he got garlic bread for us both, and then that he thought the bread was his. I felt crazy as I usually do when these conversations happen with him, so I thought to check the nanny cam to see what really happened.He handed me my food saying \"and there's garlic bread on top for you\" and then later, when I called him out for taking it from my place, he didn't say \"This bread is mine?\" or \"I got this to share,\" he said \"Okay. Can I have some of your garlic bread?\"I took these clips from our nanny cam and sent them to him, asking why he would lie about something so small and turn it into a massive thing. He immediately got mad and said \"I can't believe you would do something as ridiculous as checking the camera. You're so out of line.\" and stormed off.So reddit, am I the asshole/out of line for using our nanny cam to call my spouse out for lying?",

As many of you mentioned, yes my brother is the \"golden child\" of the family and thinking about it now that favoritism is the main reason i wanted to move away from them so badly in the first place. I had a talk with my brother and my SIL where I apologized for calling their child a demon and for the condom remark. They accepted my apology but they did not apologize to me. Apparently ours and my SIL's parents were just not just telling them but encouraging them to use me for help the whole time. I told them how exhausted and frustrated I was and how much this whole shit show has hurt me and that I would not be watching Kyle anymore period and that they need to figure something else out. They did not take it well and my SIL started yelling again and after some arguing my SIL said that if I would not watch Kyle the least I could do is pay for his daycare and help with some of our other expenses since I have the money to zip off to a different country every month. I was honestly appalled. I would not have minded to help them out financially but the tone of her voice as she said it was just infuriating. The only thing they heard was that I would not continue helping them. They didn't give a shit about anything else I said. I just got up and left their house without saying a word. I wanted to leave before I completely exploded again. 10 minutes after I left my phone started buzzing with them and my parents and I just put it on DND. I read a lot of comments saying I should go No Contact and I really did not want to have to do that but they are very clearly not interested in respecting me as a human being so thats it. I will not be speaking to my family until they want to genuinely apologize to me. Thanks guys :)",

	"body" : "I have two daughters (23f) (20f). They are both so beautiful and smart and I really love them both. I always wanted them to be strong and independent women who could stand on their own feet and I tried to raise them that way.They were both interested in volleyball, I always supported their interest. My younger is still playing in a team and also studying at a good university. She is really hardworking and even if she does not succeed in playing professional volleyball, she will definitely have a good job.My older daughter quit both sports and school when she got pregnant at the age of 18. When she first told us that she was pregnant, I was very upset and advised her to have an abortion because having a child at such a young age would disrupt her life. She did not want to have an abortion and my wife supported her decision. To be honest, I was very insistent on her having an abortion at that time, but when I saw that she remained determined, I dropped the issue and supported her fully, even though I didn't want to.She got married quickly with the baby's father. Then she decided to stay at home and take care of her child and her husband started to work. I never wanted my daughter to be financially dependent on her husband, but I never voiced it either. But of course, my daughter know that I'm bothered by this.Yesterday we were having dinner with my daughters and my wife. My wife and daughter started talking about being a mother. My wife told her that even though I wanted her to have an abortion, I love my grandson very much now. My daughter asked me if that was so, and I said, \"Of course I love him.\" I really love my grandson, but my daughter knew that I was bothered by her situation, so it didn't sound sincere at all.My daughter said I could give an honest answer. I told her that I really love my grandson but that I was disappointed that she had become a mother at an early age, had left school and her job and was now dependent on a man. She didn't argue with me but the rest of the night was a bit tense.At the end of the night she went home and my wife started a fight over what I said. I told her that she was the one who wanted an honest answer, but my wife is sure that I'm an AH. My younger one agrees with me but says I was rude to say it out loud.Edit:I'm not sorry that my daughter doesn't live the life I want, I'm sorry that she lives dependent on another person, and I can't say that their marriage is going very well.They chose the sport they wanted to be interested in, the university they wanted to go or their hobbies etc. I didn't force anything on them. All I want is for them to be self-sufficient.I also told my daughter that I would pay for a babysitter if she wanted to go back to school or get a job. Yes, she is only 23 years old and could still have a career, but she's not doing that.Edit 3:Since yesterday I have received many comments about what a good father I am and what a terrible father I am. It's okay.In the second edit (I posted it in the comments) I said I would apologise to my daughter, which I did. It was a long conversation, but I don't have the time today. So I can't go into detail. Also no matter how much I go into detail, some people here seem to be very interested in making things up. So it will be a wasted effort.In short, I apologised and explained to her that I'm more worried than disappointed, thankfully she understood. I reminded her again that I love her and will always be there for her.Also my suspicions about their marriage turned out to be correct. They don't have a good marriage, her husband has suggested therapy, but she doubts it will work. This time I didn't tell her what to do, I told her that I would support her in whatever she does. I told her that if she wants to go back to school or work, my offer of babysitter still stands, and if she wants more from me, I will always do it.So I'm still the best father ever <3",

	"body" : "Five years ago, when I was in high school, I got a job as a kennel technician at a pet store. when I got the job, I was told to go get a few pairs of scrubs, and that I need to wear scrubs to work every day. I helped people out around the store just like all of the other employees, but my main job was to help the vet take care of the puppies. Obviously, the vet did the heavy lifting and I was just there to assist. I don’t know for sure why I was required to wear scrubs when the most medical thing I did was give the dogs their medicine, and I’m pretty sure it was just so the kennel techs looked professional (the owner was a bit pretentious and was always concerned with appearing professional).Three years ago when I started college, I had to quit my job at the pet store. I was determined to pay my way through college and not take out any student loans, and as much as I loved that job, it did not pay very well. When I quit, I got rid of all of the shirt scrubs, but I kept the pants because as it turns out, nurses have been holding out on us, and scrubs are really comfortable. I treat them like sweatpants. They are comfortable and just something for me to wear around the house on my day off, but I would never go out in public wearing them.Fast forward to two days ago, when I went out to go check the mail while wearing some of my old scrubs without thinking about it. Our neighbor who lives in front of the mailboxes was out watering her garden and she perked up when she saw me. She she got all excited and told me about how her daughter was a nurse, and how she knew I was in college but she didn’t know I was going to college to be a nurse. So I of course cut her off and said oh I’m actually in college getting a degree in history and I go on to explain why I had the scrubs and all that. To say she was mad about me wearing scrubs would be an understatement. She compared it to stolen valor, when people dress up like veterans and first responders when they aren’t. She went on and on about how hard her daughter worked to become a nurse, and that nurses “have earned the right to wear scrubs.” I was honestly a little baffled, because I wasn’t trying to pretend to be a nurse, and now, one of my neighbors who I barely know is lecturing me in the middle of our neighborhood.She posted on Facebook that afternoon that she saw someone out in public wearing scrubs, and that when she talked to them it turned out they weren’t even a nurse. It was very clear that she was talking about me, but I do appreciate that she said it was a stranger at a grocery store since she is friends with a lot of the people in our neighborhood. I didn’t even consider that I could be in the wrong until I saw how everyone who was commenting on her post was agreeing with her. So am I the asshole?",

I’ve said many times that I’m not concerned about these kind of things either way, but it comes up periodically.Last night Ben and I went to dinner with 6 of my friends. There were 3 men in total and 5 women. At the end of the dinner the two guys “Max” and “Harry” said they would get the bill, as the guys usually do when we’re out. Ben quietly said to me that he wasn’t really comfortable with the guys paying for his dinner so I said I’d chip in with the bill. Ben said thank you but could he chip in and then I could pay him back afterwards because he didn’t want them to know I was paying.This struck me as totally absurd because firstly, it’s an unnecessary step, second even split the cost was something I wasn’t sure he would realistically be able to cover, and third I felt like he was trying to enter a pissing contest with my friends which was just childish.I said no I would just pay and then turned to everyone and said I’d chip in a third of the bill. No one batted an eyelid, but Ben was sulking.He’s now mad at me saying I emasculated him and made him look bad in front of my friends.

I (M34) had no idea he was trans or even questioning his gender, he always seemed perfectly happy as a girl, y'know he was very feminine presenting and all. Turns out he came out to our parents after getting his hair cut and they didn't take it well in the slightest.From what he's told me, he wasn't exactly kicked out, they just started being unbearable. They were calling him 'Myla' in every sentence they said (just to annoy him i suppose), mum kept booking him in for appointments to get hair extensions and his lashes done, our da didn't let him wear the male uniform to sixth form and so on.It got so bad that he literally took a train from down south to up the north to ask if he could live with me. Of course, I said yes. The house is big enough to have him live there, there's four bedrooms and an attic room.My girlfriend (Nico, 32) was irritated when she found out. We've discussed her moving in before Will came and now she's telling me that she will not move in until Will leaves. I've explained to her that Will isn't a child we'd have to constantly supervise, that if anything he's the one making the place more liveable (he's very insistent on adding on to the home decor and so on, as well as being better than me at cleaning.), and that the house is large enough to still have privacy even with him around.Nico's argued that it's not truly 'ours' if Will is always there, that we won't be able to start trying to concieve, that she's not willing to live with a 'hormonal and rebellious' teenager and that she's just flat out uncomfortable with Will being near her and living with her and her son (M10) in the same home.Ultimately, I've told her that my loyalties lie with my baby brother, who is homeless and vulnerable, unlike the grown woman with a good paying job and a home of her own. She's called my mum up to complain about it and she's said that i was in the wrong for prioritizing Will, and Will himself said that he doesn't want to be 'causing problems' in my relationship.update : https://www.reddit.com/user/mourrningglory/comments/19aubaa/aita_for_telling_my_gf_my_loyalties_lie_with_my/",

I work very long hours throughout the week with sometimes only one or maybe zero days off in the week, average of 75-80 hours a week. I bring home a majority of the money, (my paychecks are almost over 80% our whole income) not that it affects how I think of her and our relationship.She is able to provide things like fun groceries (snacks/sweets) and when we go out she can pay for things like the tip or drinks and I really appreciate that and tell her thank you when she can swing it. She also does most of the chores in the small apt. Other than that I'm the person paying for our life. (Groceries/toiletries/outings/clothes/makeup and not to mention rent and all other real bills)She works in a VERY different field and works  3 sometimes if her job requires, 4 days a week. She is working toward her career and I'm proud of her for this. Most days she'll work an average of 6 maybe 7 hours on her work days. This is where the problem has started.Alot of my work nights are late, 12 or 1 am when I get home. Ill pack snacks but never get to eat. So alot of days I come home hungry for an actual meal. Recently those nights have been more frequent and i just don't want to have to cook something for myself after a 13 hour day after doing the same all week. I just want to be able to eat with the minimal amount of work when I get home.The other night I came home around 1:30AM and found my wife passed out on the couch with an empty personal pizza from Little Ceasars. I got excited thinking that I had a cold one in the fridge waiting for me.....wrong. annoyed but not upset, I microwave some chef boyardee, scarf it down and call it a night. The next day I have the same kind of night, around 1:30 I get home. There she is passed out, now with a bowl of macaroni and weenies (one of my favorites) and again. Nothing in the fridge for me.Not understanding why she couldn't just make enough for the both of us and put my bowl in the fridge, wake her up to ask. She gets a little snappy if someone wakes her up but this time she was pissed. Saying that she is NOT my maid and I'm being lazy trying to make her cook for me. I tell her I'm just hungry after a long day and it upset me seeing she cooked for herself and didn't think about me at all. I said she was being inconsiderate and that really set her off. Saying if I want a slave then she's not it. I told her I don't want a slave, I want a wife who seems to care about me. She looked at me with a shocked face and stormed out.  Her mother texted saying she showed up at their house balling and HOW I should be more considerate to her feelings. I haven't even responded because I just feel hurt and not cared for.I just wanted dinner. AITA?Edit: i really should have mentioned this is a conversation we have had before and i feel ignored since she barely acknowledges when ive brought it up. These last 2 times are after multiple \"conversations\" . Also definitely didn't want to seem like she shouldn't be sleeping at 1. Passed out is just terminology I use. If I'm dead asleep at 4 am I'm passed out. I appreciate the other things she does for me like cleaning but the other 8 hours of free time in her day I wanted to be thought of since I would do the same for her no questions.",

The server was asking what the kids wanted, when my 12 year old (We'll call her Emily) said, \"Cheeseburger with bacon\". My husband butted in and said, \"With lettuce and tomato\" Emily's face immediately fell. My husband didn't even notice, and Emily looked super bummed.After the sever took our orders, my husband turned to Emily, and asked her what's wrong. She said that she didn't want lettuce and tomato on her burger, because she doesn't like them. He sighed and said that that they've been through this a million times, and having vegetables with every meal was super important. Emily looked like she was about to cry. She is neurodivergent and a lot of food taste's and textures really bother her, tomatoes being a large one. My husband doesn't seem to care, which REALLY bothers me.When the food came, Emily didn't even touch the burger. So when my husband went to the bathroom, I took the lettuce and tomato off the burger, put them on mine, and winked at Emily. She grinned and gladly ate her burger. My husband didn't say anything about it, until that night.He told me that taking the vegetables off was a violation of his trust, because he was just looking out for our daughter. I told him that it was just one meal, and not having vegetables ONCE wasn't a big deal. He said that those vegetables were very important. I left the room, and have been talking to him as little as possible. So Reddit, AITA for taking the vegetables off my daughters burger? I think I might be TAH because it's just lettuce and tomato, and my kids having vegetables is really important to my husband, but I feel like he was being super controlling, and I NEVER want to see my child upset.UPDATE:I went to bed when this post had about 200 comments and 50 something upvotes. Now there is 5.8 thousand upvotes, and 1.8 thousand comment. I have been reading through a ton of them, and my heart is breaking for everyone who is sharing their stories with eating disorders and their relationship with food. I have deiced to discuss with my older two about getting into therapy. I'm still trying to figure out what to do with my dick for a husband. Divorce is a serious contender. I would've considered it sooner, but I always thought that it would be better for the kids if we stayed together. I've now realized that my husband is harming my children in ways that could be life threatening. I'm thinking about taking the kids over to my parent's house for the week, because I don't think I can handle my husband doing this stuff to my babies. Thank you so much for all of your support, and I really appreciate it. I will update later about what I've decided to do.",

I had a few bad experiences with dogs as a kid. Her dog is very friendly and he gets all the attention from my fiance. She denied some jobs that won't let her work from home as she is worried about the dog. I work from home 3 days a week and she only texts asking how the dog is.I planned this very nice trip last weekend to celebrate our engagement. I booked a nice hotel and made reservations at a nice restaurant. One of our close friends stayed with the dog. My fiance asked her to text with an update every two hours. I did my best to make it a wonderful weekend.We had reservations for 7PM at the restaurant. My fiance didn't get ready until 6:40 as she hadn't heard from the sitter. When we arrived at the restaurant, we had to wait 30 minutes for a table to open. When we sat down, my fiance spent the entire dinner on her phone trying to get ahold of the friend. I paid for the meal and got up from the table telling her that I was going to wait in the car. She came out 20 minutes later screaming at me for leaving her at the table alone.I yelled back that she ruined our engagement trip for putting the dog over us. We sat in the silence all the way home and she's thinking about going to stay with her parents. I'm now being called an AH for leaving from the restaurant.",

She wanted this really detailed job done and wanted her daughter's name, Melody, painted on the wall. I wasn't sure about it because my sister is known to take advantage of me being her older brother. But I ultimately agreed because I figured I would just set boundaries. She was impossible to work with, pushed my boundaries, and I was working on it a lot longer than intended because of how much she wanted done and how detailed she was about everything. It took 2 weeks of me doing a few hours every day for her to be okay with it. I told her I was done and said she'd need to find someone else for the next kid if she has one.My niece was born a week ago and my sister changed her mind about the name because she said it was too similar to my daughter's name. So she decided on the name Birdie for her daughter. Cool. She told me I'd need to fix the name in the nursery and I told her no, she'll have to find someone else to fix the name in the nursery because I won't be doing that again. She said it will look off if done by someone else and I told her it was not my problem.She yelled at me and then she tried to get my wife to change my mind. My wife told her where to go and said she had taken up so much of my time on the nursery anyway that she was rude to demand more. I was pissed when my sister went to my wife behind my back. I was so damn proud of my wife for not letting my sister make those demands.My sister told me I'm being a dick and her daughter doesn't deserve for me to be petty over our issues.AITA?",

He cooks dinner 'occasionally' (2 x a month). He doesn't hoover, mop, or mow lawns. I get it, he's tired and he works full time, but I work too, and I don't feel appreciated.

However, there is this one coworker, let's call her Sarah (32F), who has been increasingly crossing boundaries.A bit of background, Sarah joined the company around a year ago, and we were initially friendly. We would have lunch together occasionally and chat about random things. I didn't think much of it, and it seemed like a normal office friendship. However, over time, I noticed that Sarah had started to use my belongings without asking for permission. For example, she would take my stapler, pens, or even my phone charger without asking. At first, I brushed it off as her just being forgetful and not realizing that these were my personal items. I tried to be understanding and not let it bother me.But then, things started to escalate. One day, I brought in a special lunch I had prepared as a treat for myself. It was a dish that my grandmother used to make for me, and it had a lot of sentimental value. I had placed it in the fridge with a note clearly stating it was mine. When lunchtime came around, I discovered that Sarah had taken and eaten my lunch. I confronted her, and she apologized, claiming that she thought it was meant for the whole office to share. I didn't buy it, but I let it go to avoid causing a scene.Over the next few months, Sarah's behavior continued to worsen. She began using my personal laptop without asking, even though we all have our own work computers. She would also use my coffee mug and other personal items, despite me having my name on them. I tried to address it politely and asked her to stop, but she would just laugh it off and say she didn't mean any harm.Finally, I reached my breaking point last week. I had bought a new, expensive pair of headphones to use at work, and I had left them on my desk overnight. When I arrived the next day, I found Sarah using them at her desk. I was furious and asked her to hand them over immediately. She tried to play it off as a joke, but I had enough. I told her that it was not funny and that she needed to stop using my personal belongings without permission. I said it was disrespectful and a violation of my privacy.The rest of the office heard the commotion and some of my coworkers agreed with me, while others said I was overreacting and should let it go. Sarah hasn't spoken to me since, and the atmosphere has become tense. A few coworkers have even suggested that I owe Sarah an apology for embarrassing her in front of everyone.So, AITA for telling my coworker to stop using my personal belongings?",

	"body" : "When I (16m) was a baby, my parents divorced. My dad had been cheating on my mom, and it only came to light because his mistress (my stepmom) got pregnant and made him choose between her and my mom. Nine months, and one divorce later, my brother Ethan (now 14) was born.Needless to say, my mom isn’t fond of Ethan. She doesn’t hate him, but she doesn’t love him either, or want any type of relationship with him. On the semi-frequently times where she sees him (when she picks me up and drops me off from my dad’s house) she basically ignores him. She avoids making eye contact or ever initiating conversation with him, and when he tries to talk to her, she gives short answers and gets us both on our way asap.My dad and stepmom have sheltered Ethan from the past family drama, and it’s always been frustrating, but I figured it wasn’t my place to interfere. Because of that, he didn’t understand why my mom doesn’t like him. He thought it was because she hates my dad (a bit true) and is a cold, resentful old hag who can’t leave the past behind and is jealous of my stepmom (his words exactly from two years ago, and again partially true minus the jealousy, but imo she has a good reason). Before y’all tell me that my mom lied to me about my dad’s affair, he’s admitted to everything as I’ve told it when I pressed him for details some years back.Anyway, onto the inciting incident. My mom planned a vacation, and of course I was invited, but she also invited my paternal uncle (who took my mom’s side in the family schism that was the affair and divorce and who still remains close friends with her to this day) and his kids. When Ethan found out that his cousins were invited on the vacation but not him, he broke down and came to me asking why my mom hates him so much. He actually broke down crying, I felt so bad for him. I decided that he deserved to know the truth.I tried to break the truth as gently as I possibly could, but there’s really no good way to tell a sobbing kid that he’s the result of cheating and that’s why my mom never wanted a relationship with him.The good side is that he wasn’t crying anymore or mad at my mom, the bad side was that he was really pissed off at his parents. Well, I had to leave for the vacation (I’m actually writing on the flight lol) and my dad and stepmom have been blowing up my phone. They’re furious at me for “telling him before he was ready”. I let my mom know the situation and she told me that that was “kind of a jerk move” because I dropped a bomb and left them to clean up the mess. Ethan isn’t exactly emotionally mature, and considering the fury that I last saw him in, I wouldn’t want to deal with that clusterfuck either. Now I’m thinking I might have undermined my dad and stepmom’s parenting, and maybe I should have at least waited until after I got back so I could help prevent the implosion that’s going on back home.

I’m incredibly grateful to now be 13 weeks pregnant and have been looking forward to sharing that news with my family.On Friday, we had dinner with my family - my sister, her boyfriend, and our parents - and we decided to share our news then. I decided to wait until dessert, so that we could leave shortly after telling everyone. Obviously, it’s exciting news, but I was worried about all the emotions that could surface for myself and my husband.Right after we sat down to eat, my sister announced that she and her boyfriend are expecting their first child. I was thrilled for her and congratulated her, as did the rest of the family. Once things had settled down, I didn’t want to waste the opportunity to have everyone together and thought it would be a good opportunity to keep the joy flowing, so I shared that I’m pregnant as well.Our parents were so excited to be having two new grandbabies just a month apart and I was super happy that my kids would have a new cousin. My sister was happy for me but she left very soon after dinner and didn’t stay for dessert.She called me this afternoon and told me that as happy as she was for me, she felt that I’d done a shitty thing by taking away “her moment.” She pointed out that this is my second baby and when I announced for the first time, I didn’t have to “share” with anyone. I didn’t want to apologize because I didn’t feel I’d done anything wrong, but she finished out the phone call by saying that she didn’t think I was really even happy for her, if I couldn’t have let her have that moment and taken another for myself later on. That really stung.I truly didn’t see it that way. I saw it as sharing joy, not stealing it. I also see each pregnancy as being unique, so I don’t feel that it was right of her to say I shouldn’t have said anything because it was my second baby.

To be blunt, I never wanted to be a parent, particularly not at 21. However, Jake's mother did and it wasn't my decision. Although we have always kept the peace, things have always been icy between us due to that.However, I always tried to do right by Jake. I would have him every other weekend and for a month during the summer, would do my best to deliver on anything he asked of me, treated him kindly and tried to be a good father. Then at a certain point, his mother married a guy Jake hated and I had him move in with me once he was 13. I won't lie, I wasn't cut out to be a parent. I love Jake, but I just hated parenting. I did it anyway since he was my son. We have a very good relationship, and I've never shirked any responsibility to him.Jake also became a father at 21. However, he was all for it and is happily married to Mike's mother. I also got him into my electrician's union and had him set up on some good jobs. So, he was on much, much better footing than I was for a child.  Back then, we had a long talk and I told him \"Jake, being a parent is a very, very different life. It is hard, exhausting and on a day-to-day basis, you don't really get to do what you want to do very much. It will be a very long time before you don't have that kind of responsibility anymore.\"Then the conversation turned to how I'd help him.  I told him no. I am retired from parenting. I am turning back to my own life. He has his own home, union job, is engaged, and adult enough to decide to have a baby. He's the adult now. He's the parent.  I'll be around and if there are any emergencies, obviously I'll do what I can.  But I won't be an \"active\" grandparent.I've largely held to it. I have been doing a lot of travel, I have a GF, hobbies and to be blunt, I'm doing all the things I didn't get to do in my 20s. Do I see Jake and his family? Yes. However, I rarely agree to babysit. Jake resents that I don't go to Mike's games (they tend to conflict with my weightlifting club) and that I'm pretty hands off with Mike.  Things came to a head last week when Mike had a baseball tournament and I refused to go because I had plans to take a scuba class with my GF (which admittedly could be rescheduled). I didn't tell Jake this, but I spent so many Saturdays bored out of my skull watching little league when Jake was little. I always cheered loudly, was crazy supportive and never let on that it was like watching paint dry. But this is no longer my responsibility.So I told him \"Jake, I spent 20 years parenting. That's enough.\" He then yelled at me that I am always jetting around, playing like a teenager and not putting him first.  I told him that no, I wasn't. I did that for 20 years to get him on his feet as an adult. I've done that and can go back to prioritizing my own life.",

I told him to get it!”At first, we thought she was joking or messing with us, but she continued doing it and the rest of us were side-eyeing each other and were kind of uncomfortable.I asked her if she could save the pet names for home because some of us were feeling uncomfortable. She got upset and told me to stop making such a big deal over a nickname and slut-shaming her. I told her that wasn’t my intention at all, but I would appreciate if she could stop because it was killing the vibe.She started ranting at me about a whole lot of stuff, and I just told her and her boyfriend to please leave. Her boyfriend was pissed too but they eventually got out.The rest of the evening was less uncomfortable and way more peaceful (a few of my friends who didn’t know the girl I kicked thanked me for making her leave), but we all felt kind of awkward because of what happened.

I can not use cups and am allergic to all brands of pad I've used (rashes on all genitalia, which does not feel good). I do have cloth pads but I only brought a couple small ones for my trip as I wasn't due on until days after we got home, but we're on day four of our trip and I started my period on our first night.I tried to use some disposable pads I picked up but I broke out in a rash and have blisters everywhere they should not be, so two days ago I decided to say what the hell and free bleed like I do at home.I bring my own towels to my MILs, so I have been sitting and sleeping on those. I have bled through twice but cleaned the mess and left no stain.My MIL is pissed off to say the least. She's disgusted by my lack of decorum and carrying my bloody towel around everywhere. She also hates that I'm washing them in her machines and is now saying we need to pay to have them professionally cleaned (which we will do).Everything kinda came to a head last night when she lost it on me for \"behaving like an animal\". She wants me to leave, but my husband stay, which isn't possible (one car, I can't drive that far, especially not with the amount of pain I'm in).My husband is on damage control but I just feel so shitty.

I'll replace them if she wants.I'm close to just gritting my teeth through the pain and putting a pad on, but I really don't want to.

	"body" : "I (F30) have a niece who is 13. Up until a week ago, she still believed in Santa. I asked her parents (my brother and SIL) if she was just pretending to still believe to not make them feel bad, or maybe to get more gifts or something, but they were adamant she still believed. Last Christmas Eve I was at their house for dinner, and she kept saying things like “I’m so excited for Santa to come tonight” and telling me everything she had asked him for and wondering what country he was in at that very moment. She doesn’t have any younger siblings, so it’s not like she was saying this for anybody else’s benefit. She is a smart girl, does well in school, and has no developmental delays that I know of. She just, for whatever reason, still believed in Santa at age 13.Her parents didn’t seem to have an issue with it. They said they absolutely did not want to tell her the truth and “ruin the magic” of Christmas. Plus they said it was beneficial for them because believing in Santa would encourage her to “be good” in the hopes of getting better presents/not getting coal.I love my niece a lot, and after agonizing over this for some time, I felt it might be necessary to tell her the truth, if her parents were refusing. I remember how brutal middle school girls can be. I mean, she had to be the only girl at her school who still believed in Santa. If it somehow got out that she still believed, and she got teased or bullied, that could be brutal and awful for her. Wasn’t it better to hear it from her aunt than some mean girl (or guy)?So, a week ago, I told her the truth. I tried to do it in a gentle way, explaining that what Santa represents (the spirit of Christmas) is very real, but that there wasn’t actually a guy with flying reindeer going to every kid’s house in one night to deliver presents. She didn’t say much and got a bit teary eyed. But she did reach out to me a few days later and let me know that she appreciated me telling her the truth.Her parents, however, are furious at me and not talking to me.

She's my best friend and I absolutely adore her, with one minor flaw, she is a huge workaholic/perfectionist.While we both have very well-paying jobs, Jen's job is way more stressful and time-demanding. Even though she is brilliant and amazing at what she does, she often works around the clock (on average, 60-hour weeks) at home and in office.This wasn't a problem before, but about two weeks ago her doctor told her to take a step back from work (i.e., go on leave early) because the stress was starting to cause her a couple of health issues, even though the babies are fine.However, being the workaholic that she is, she has still been working from her laptop 6-8 hours every day. Which, fine, I understand that she had a couple of cases that she needed to finish. But most days she was so focused on work that she was forgetting to eat meals and falling asleep at her desk.So, yesterday when I got home, I realized that she had done the same thing again. I woke her up and told her that she needed to go rest in bed. She insisted she was fine and said there was an emergency with a client of hers and she just needed to finalize some things for a coworker.I asked her just to take a break first and take a nap/eat, but she said that she would once she was done and that it wouldn't take her more than an hour. I told her fine, but no longer than an hour even though I was pretty annoyed.So, two hours later when she was still working, I became frustrated and unplugged the Wi-Fi and put the cable out of sight. The only purpose of this was to cut her off from work on her laptop because she clearly had no intention of stopping.Once she realized, she yelled at me, called me an AH, and she said that I was treating her like a child and accused me of being controlling, condescending, and \"borderline abusive.\"I told her that she is being stupid and just to let the coworker that asked for her help to handle it. I said that she was free to use the mobile hotspot on her phone, or figure out the router herself, but otherwise I would plug it back in when I woke up (which I did).She was so mad that she slept in the guest room and when I went to apologize the next morning for calling her stupid (not for cutting the internet) she said that she can't even look at me. She hasn't said another word to me yet.I'm starting to feel like I might have been a bit extreme, even if I only did it out of concern. but honestly, overdoing it by trying to meet deadlines that she's not even supposed to be responsible for.AITA?Edit: So, uh yeah… I wrote this thinking it would get 20 comments at most.Jen and I had a calm discussion about last night, pretty much immediately after I posted.She called me on my shit, told me that I only stressed her out more by cutting the internet (something a lot of people pointed out), and we both decided what we would respond if the other person was acting in a way that was harmful to our family so that we both would feel respected. I apologized for calling her stupid, and she apologized for calling me abusive… as it turns out neither of us meant the name-calling. I promised to trust her judgement, she promised not to overdo it with work. I mentioned that we should go to therapy at least once before the boys are born, and she also thought it was a good idea. We made up, got burgers, and she passed out on the couch.But I do agree that I was in the wrong here, and I accept my yta judgement. It’s deserved and I’m going to work on myself.Side note: it is horrifying that so many people were able to able to make out exactly what she does from what little I said about her job.

She communicates solely via ASL.For some background, my daughter (17F) is generally a very non-problematic teenager. She does amazing in school, and has never caused any problems other than regular teenage hormone stuff. However, she doesn’t like my husband and step daughter. She is not outwardly rude, but basically ignores their existence (skipped SDs birthday party, doesn’t engage in anything other than basic small talk with my husband). I did try to do family activities together to have the bond and all, but I stopped pushing it when it didn’t happen and as long as she’s not being outwardly rude or harmful to them, I can’t exactly punish her for not liking them.Now, since my relationship with my now husband started getting serious, I started taking ASL classes and am now basically as fluent as a hearing person can be. My daughter, however, never made an effort, which is ok since she technically has no responsibility towards her.However, recently my daughter has started watching SD (paid) when we aren’t around, which changes things. In my opinion, since she is now spending time in which she is responsible for a young child, she needs to learn at least basic communication. When I brought it up to her , she outright refused to make any effort at all. I tried recommending YouTube videos, but she refused to try learning even a couple words, saying she’s not responsible for my choice to be in the life of a disabled child.This issue has also been causing a lot of problems in my marriage. My husband confided in me that he’s starting to feel uncomfortable with his young daughter living with someone who is so cold she refuses to make even the most basic effort, or engage with her at all. He has brought up that he is considering divorce due to his concerns about how SD will be affected by this.So given all that, I had to finally put my foot down. I told my daughter that we have a disabled person living in our household for the foreseeable future, and if she wants to live here for college (graduating next month), she has to at least learn basic ASL. She doesn’t have to like her stepfather and stepsister, nor does she have to hang out with them, but she has to have the ability to communicate with her for the sake of safety and basic decency. I made it clear that if she chooses not to, she is welcome to live in a dorm (that I will pay for ), it’s just that living in our house (that is also my SD’s house, my husband and I paid for the house equally) comes with basic rules.Well, my daughter hasn’t spoken to me for 7 days, so its about time I ask, AITA?",

Something I've learned (fun news for anyone aspiring to follow down that same path) is that a LOT of people, mostly older women, feel that if you get pregnant they suddenly have the right to both comment and touch your body without permission. Sometimes/often without warning- even total strangers. I'm an intrinsically private person and while I don't take offense, it does encourage the inner snark to come out.I started showing around 5/6 months. I have two fibroids that are each quite large, think softball size. This causes me to look bigger and further along than I am. I've also not really gained elsewise (yes I'm aware it's a good problem to have, but I do look disproportionate) so it's REALLY apparent even under hoodies. Fast forward to last weekend.I was in our local grocery store and an older, larger woman walks up to me and says something akin to \"aw hunny, congrats! How far along are you?\". Kindly, sure, so I smile, step out of touching distance (this is usually when they go for a belly feel) and say \"8 months\". She looked at me with a shocked expression and exclaims \"Oh hun NO I would have guessed any day now! YOU'RE HUGE!!\"So... I smiled sweetly back at her and said \"aw thanks, you too\".You can imagine it didn't go over well. At one point she said something about it being medical, and so my one interjection was \"hey me too\"- but it didn't do much to diffuse the situation. Eventually she huffed away and I carried on my business.I don't really feel bad, but I am trying to gauge the assholiness of my response. I strongly feel that there shouldn't be a stigma that pregnant women suddenly become public property, but acknowledge I could have once again been the 'bigger person'. Or responded with \"yeah I have two tumors in there with her\" which has historically gotten a sputtering apology from people too.

I replied that it was okay, that it was just upsetting because it was supposed to be just us. He said he understood and apologized once again.As for my boyfriend, we had another fight about it after I received his friend’s text so yeah, this is probably the end of a relationship lolMy (22F) boyfriend (24M) was supposed to come at mine around 8 pm so we could have dinner together.He didn’t showed up until an hour later and when he arrived, he was with a friendI greeted his friend and asked my boyfriend to follow me in the kitchen. I asked him why he was late and what was his friend doing here. He said that on his way home, he ran into the friend,they went to get drinks and when he saw the time, he invited him to eat with usI asked why he didn’t warned me before allowing him to come eat with us. He answered he didn’t think it’d bother me.When I told him that I didn’t cooked enough for three, he said that it wasn’t too late for me to cook more for his friend.I refused and said no, it is too late for me to cook more for your friend because it’s already close to 9:30pm and I have to wake up early for work tomorrow.He asked what was his friend supposed to eat then, I replied that he could either cook for his friend or give him my plate and then went to bed after saying a quick goodbye to his friend.I heard the front door open and shut minutes later and I fell asleep.When I woke up, I’d received a couple of texts from my boyfriend saying that my behavior yesterday was very rude, that his friend had felt unwelcome and me being mad at him wasn’t an excuse for the way I had treated his friend.I didn’t replied but now I feel guilty because I didn’t want to make his friend feel unwelcomeAITA?",

	"body" : "I always thought my sister (27F) and I (25M) had a decently close relationship until a few years ago when it came out that she thought of me as a \"golden child.\" She held resentment towards me for things I just looked at as the typical more lax treatment of the younger child in a family. I honestly thought the whole thing was pretty silly, especially since we were both years out of being under our parents' roof at this point, so we went a while without talking. We saw each other at family events but didn't really speak.I was invited to her engagement party as a form of an olive branch extension. It was there I met her future husband's younger brother, and we immediately got along. The two of us got to know each other and spent about a year as friends before making things official around a month before my sister's wedding.I love his family so much. His parents are warm and inviting in a way that feels so genuine, even before I was introduced as a significant other. (Not to knock my parents, but with them being lawyers and working politically adjacent careers, it can be easy to become jaded when you watch them schmooze to people's faces even when that doesn't reflect their true feelings.) I was the first person he ever brought home to meet them and they made me feel like part of the family immediately. Their youngest brother has been equally as welcoming and regularly schools me in Overwatch 2 by staying alive far longer than I ever could.When I told my sister this, thinking it was something we could bond over, she was angry again. Apparently she didn't receive the same treatment. This resulted in a big argument which led to her saying something to the effect of \"I guess this is what happens when two golden children get together.\" I pushed back against this, and it further devolved with her pointing out that out of all the people in the world, she couldn't believe I had chosen her husband's brother. She said I had stolen opportunities from her growing up and now I was \"stealing\" her in-laws.I considered telling my partner's parents about this at one point to let them know the animosity my sister apparently holds towards them, but I decided against it. I don't really know where I stand in this conflict and at this point I'd just like some outside perspective.AITA?",

She didn't have the money and I was the one who paid everything for her, etc. None of her friends had helped, and neither did any of our other relatives.Much later, when she had gotten out of her issues, I once urgently required some money. I asked her and she refused by saying she can't help and to not bother her about it again. I was shocked considering how much I had spent for her, and when she continued to refuse I asked her whether she had forgotten what I had done for her.Ashley asked me how I can say that I cured her when it was the medicines that worked, and that I wasn't the doctor. She said it was the medicines and the doctor that treated her and not me. I didn't argue.When the wedding date was fixed I told her that I am not coming. She was surprised and asked me why, and I told her that I have better things to do with my time than attending weddings of people like her.She got mad and asked me what my problem was, and that she wants everyone to be present. She asked me to not insult her. I told her that she herself had insulted me by brushing away every thing I did for her, and that she's extremely ungrateful for not helping me with money when she could have. I told her I hadn't even asked her back the money I had spent on her, but she had no humanity at all.We had an argument and everyone asked me to forget about she said and to attend.

I apologized and told her that even if she wanted to live with them, I would still bring her back home because I love her too much and can't live without her, so she is stuck with me.she has some conditions for forgiving me for example she continues to torture me by forcing me to binge watch riverdale with her. and she wants a daddy, daughter day and I'm guessing that I'm not going to like any of her plans based on the evil grin on her face, but I'll do whatever makes her happy.There were a lot of NTA votes.

She moved in about a month into their relationship, and I didn't have a problem with her at first, until she tried to actually mother me. I'm not talking about giving advice or being a supportive role model, more like giving me a 9:00 curfew (I live in a rural town so that's a joke) and cleaning up after HER dog has an accident. Everytime I'd bring it up to my dad, he'd say \"Just try, for me.\"  Needless to say, I moved out soon after.Fast forward to a week ago. My dad invites me over for dinner, out of nowhere, as we haven't spoken in quite sometime. I hesitantly accept, and spend the following few days trying to prepare myself for what they're going to say. I show up that night, bottle of wine in hand, anxious out of my mind. The night goes on for a few hours, us exchanging small talk, until I can't take it anymore and ask why they invited me. My dad said that they were getting married and wanted me to be his best man. I'm not going to lie, I laughed. Hard. This turned into the fiancé crying because she thinks that I don't like her, and I told her she was correct.It should also be said that given the option between me or his fiancé, my dad would choose her in a heartbeat. For example, I went on a two-day camping trip. I had a spot in the garage for my car when I left, she had it when I got back until I moved out. And I really only care about that because hail damage.I've been getting comments about if that was the worst the fiancé was while I was living there, so I guess this is info I should add to the post. She comes from a very Christian family, and if her parents found out about the situation, I've heard, she'd be essentially shunned. So I guess the biggest thing is her keeping us a secret. She expects us to just accept her into the family, and I guess her assumptions were somewhat correct, but how can she expect that when she doesn't think we're worth of her family? She KNOWS she's doing something wrong, yet she wants us to play along like no one is being hurt. However, at this point, I guess that one thing could've changed. I didn't ask at dinner.",

We moved to her home state from mine because she was wanted to be closer to her parents and her childhood friends. Now, she is a lot more social than I am. She goes on 3-4 girls trips a year. I have no issues with that and I'm happy to babysit the kids full time in her absence. I'm more of a homebody anyway so I usually like to just paint in the spare room or play video games every once in a while instead of traveling out of state. I don't really take time off from work unless we do something as a familyFor the past 3-4 months, I was very busy on a major project at work. I've been working 60 hour weeks and frankly I'm exhausted with the stress. So when the project was finally coming to an end, I told my wife I'm taking a day off and I won't be doing any work around the house. Of course, I'd still clean up after myself but I didn't want to do any chores or childcare on that one day. I told her that 2 weeks in advance and she agreed. I also reminded her three days beforeHowever, when that day came, my wife \"forgot\" about our agreement. I was in the painting room and my wife interrupted me telling me she needed me to give our daughter a bath because she spilt milk all over herself and couldn't do it because she had to wash the dishes. It was annoying but whatever, shit happens. Later on when I was playing video games, my wife tells me our son needs help for his math homework. I ask her why can't she help him herself, she said it's because she has some \"work\" to do. This work was actually her best friend coming over and chatting for an hour. This really pissed me off so after I helped my son and the best friend left, I told my wife I'm leaving the house for 4-5 hours. She asked me where I was going, I told her I'm just going to chill in the park and do whatever. But then she said needs me to help out with the chores and with the kids. I told her that today was my day off from all work including house work and it's her job to babysit the kids on this day before I left the houseWhen I came back she was acting cold and called me an asshole for just abandoning her and the kids.

The presentation was 15 minutes minimum with a 15-minute question session afterwards.There’s one guy in my course (John-21m) who many people in the course dislike. He’s the epitome of an ‘well acktuhally’ guy who likes to be the devil’s advocate for things that shouldn’t have a devil’s advocate. He’s embarrassed himself more than once by asking ridiculous and pointless questions to our professors that have no relevance and he’s very full of himself. I’m aware that this all may seem harsh, but this has been consistent behaviour for the past 2 years and his smarminess has isolated himself from many people in our course who don't want to deal with him.After our presentation, he says he has ‘several questions’ and proceeds to ask some of the most irrelevant questions. For example, in the presentation, I mentioned that one of my inspirations for the project was a trend in 2020 where grown men (usually 30-40-year-olds) would duet teenage girl’s (13-17) tiktoks mocking them; from how they liked their coffee to their prom dresses. John’s question was ‘don’t you think they should get criticism for posting online?’. Not only was this not relevant to the project, but you could sense the tension in the room. So many people rolled their eyes and even his friend gave him a 'shut up' nudge.After a few more questions which were all directed at me, not the other 3 people in the group, I admittedly got annoyed and said ‘listen, mate. I’m not going to answer any more questions from you. You’re clearly trying to grasp at straws here’.The rest of the questions from our other peers were great and actually of substance. And overall, I feel the whole thing went well other than that one hiccup.As we were leaving the hall, I hear John complaining to some of his friends and then I saw him going to talk to our lecturer.I got an email from our professor asking me to join a TEAMs meeting where I was expected to apologise for ‘embarrassing’ John and something about how we were supposed to create a ‘safe space’ for our fellow peers and by being rude I didn’t do that. He said if we can sort it out before Thursday (tomorrow) by ourselves, then great so I sent John a quick message saying I didn't mean to be short with him but he was clearly asking pointless questions. He just replied 'you didn't have to be a bitch about it' and then blocked me.AITA?EDIT: Sorry for the late edit I just got back from work. There were 3 guys and 1 girl (me) in the group and the professor is a guy also.To everyone asking why I didn't handle this 'professionally': This is the first time I've done something like this and I was already nervous because of the grade/assignment aspect and I get major stage anxiety.

Because of that we've always dreamed of being grandparents, so we made long-term investments that paid off, and now we have almost $350K saved up to help raise our future grandkids and cover their college expenses.I want to make it clear that we never pressured our daughter to have children in any way. She simply knows that the money is there and what it's intended for. I'll explain why this is relevant later on.The thing is, our daughter recently made the decision not to have kids. She told us a few months ago and even had a tubal ligation soon after. We were both a bit shocked and asked if she was sure, but we also reassured her that we'll always be there for her.I won't lie, I'm really disappointed, but not in our daughter. It's her life, and it's not our place to impose anything on her. My disappointment stems from the fact that I won't have grandkids. However, if this is what makes her happy, I have no right to say anything about it.Last week, we had a lunch at our house with our daughter, and she brought up the topic of the money we had saved for our future grandkids. We simply told her that we will make use of it differently now. For example, I'll be able to work fewer hours before retirement, and we plan to use the money for travel.At that moment, our daughter's expression changed, and she fell silent. When my wife asked if she was okay, she suddenly exploded, accusing us of punishing her for not having kids and taking away the money that she would have used if she had children. The situation became really tense, and she stormed out after the argument.Now she's not speaking to us and has posted about it on social media. We've also received some unpleasant messages from our daughter's friends, expressing their disapproval of our actions.Let me be clear, we haven't disowned her. She will still receive whatever money or properties we have when we pass away. However, we saved that money specifically to support our future grandkids, and now that we know we won't have any, we decided to use it for our own purposes. Is that wrong? AITA?",

The original documents were translated for the transfer of care process, so I brought them (even if they’re already in my school medical file) to show the principal, along with a letter from the (American) neurologist, which I read out loud. I then thanked the nurse for her concern but asked what it was based on. She was pissed and asked why I didn’t tell her about the American diagnosis. I said it wasn’t one, the diagnosis was made in Spain. She asked the principal if “the insurance were even okay with a diagnosis coming from there”. She added she “doubted they were able to conduct all the tests”. So I asked her which ones they had missed, to which she said: “I don’t know, I’m not a specialist”. I couldn’t find a good comeback on the spot, but my mum laughed, and I think that was good enoughThe principal ended the meeting, and sent us an email on Friday saying that the process would remain the same. My dad hasn’t formally apologised, but he did say that she overstepped her qualifications. I’m glad I went ahead and reported it, I don’t know what would’ve happened if I hadn’t.

Due to postpartum anxiety, which she is being treated for, my wife struggles with leaving our daughter with anyone outside myself or my mother, who lives with us. This hasn’t been an issue thus far and as I said, she’s in therapy so little by little, it’s been getting better.Unfortunately, my nephew (who was also 6 months old) passed away a few weeks ago. He had been in poor health since birth but it’s still obviously devastating for the entire family, especially my brother and SIL. They held the services the following weekend.I was in consistent contact with my brother and we were discussing the funeral. He said he knew it was a lot to ask, but could we please not bring our daughter. I said I completely understood and didn’t even intend to. One, in my opinion, babies do not belong at funerals. Two, this is a funeral for a baby of a similar age. Why would one want to bring up that reminder? My brother said he knows how my wife is about leaving the baby so they understand if she can’t come.Well, my wife became irritated when she found out I “didn’t defend her”. She reminded me that she doesn’t trust anyone to take care of the baby outside me and my mom, who obviously have to be at the funeral. She doesn’t want to miss it either, but also won’t agree to leave the baby with anyone else. We have several family members on her side that we are close to, as well as good friends who also have kids. I said even if she just went to the service and not the gathering afterward, that’d just be an hour. She said no, she can’t handle the thought of leaving her with anyone else. I said that’s understandable and that clearly, my brother and SIL would rather her not come if it means not having a baby at the funeral.

One, either allow someone else to watch the baby for an hour. Two, stay home with the baby. She says that I’m not even pretending to be on her side and I said I’m not, because this isn’t even about us.My wife ended up staying home with the baby.

It was also my weekend with my twins. I had told Stacy on the way to the hospital that I would not be able to have them this weekend due to this. I had put my phone on silent and away, due to a lot going on. When I returned to my phone I had abunch of text from Stacy saying how I needed to go home and be with my twins, and how Cindy could handle this situation. I told her absolutely not, that I wasn’t missing the birth of my grandchild.She then responded angrily saying how I was picking my oldest daughter over my youngest and how wrong that was since they can only see me on the weekends anyways. I tried texting and calling multiple times throughout the weekend, getting no responses. AITA?",

This is normally a rotating thing so everyone in the family takes turns hosting.My uncle is a very .. difficult man to get along with, and I mostly went because it is important to my mom (F66). He is very rigid in his beliefs and will make it very clear to you if you have done something to offend him. Once that has happened, there is no chance for redemption regardless of whether you are family, friends, or a stranger.While at the BBQ, everyone was standing around and my daughter (F6) helped herself to a banana from the fruit bowl. Now obviously, you shouldn't take anything that doesn't belong to you without asking, but she is six and manners are still being learnt. Not saying she was right in this.That being said, my uncle lost his mind. He called her a thieving brat and started threatening to call the cops. I stepped in and he told me to pack up my stuff and go because he didn't want thieves in his home. He told me that neither myself, my daughter, or my husband (M33) would ever be welcome again because clearly this was a taught behaviour.I was furious. I told my uncle that this intolerance was why he has no friends, and why we only visit his home out of obligation. I told him that without my mom's family values, there wouldn't be anyone at the BBQ.In the middle of this, he pulled out his phone to call \"Mr Police\" and ask how a little girl would survive in prison. My daughter was beside herself, so I gathered her and my husband, and we left.Apparently, after we left, my uncle was ranting and raving, and eventually my cousin (F24) - not his child - told my uncle that he was lucky he didn't try with someone else in the family because I was still polite in what I said. She told him that she refused to eat at the home of someone who thought it is okay to bully a child.As my cousin left, apparently quite a few people followed, and suddenly it was just my uncle and his wife left. His wife has been calling me telling me that I humiliated him in his own home and I can't expect his generation to be PC.She has also told me that he has been moping ever since because he feels like an outcast in the family, and that I shouldn't have been so harsh.I am glad I stood up for my daughter, but I never intended for everyone to leave as a result of the banana.

He told me that when he was married to my sister (38) he had started college funds for my kids. They separated,  but he still wanted to give the money for my children. It's not full ride amount, but it will mean my daughter won't have to work during college unless she wants spending money, and it's more that me or my parents can give her.Obviously I was overjoyed at this... but i asked him not to tell anyone because my sister has grown quite bitter about their divorce. I'm not really sure what went down, but afaik they had separate finances, so I don't think it would be due to money reasons.When I told my family we had received a donation to my daughters college fund everyone was overjoyed.. but also really suspicious, because there are times in the last few years that money would have really helped. Someone in my family started the \"joke\" that I got this from my boss for \"favours\". It's not true, but my sister and brother won't let it go. \"Let's get takeout tonight, hey, X, go sleep with your boss and get it\". I'm not doing a good job of explaining it but its really quite hurtful to have my family saying these things, even as jokes.I'm considering telling them BIL is the one behind it.

He freaked out in the delivery room and his behavior got him kicked out the hospital. I had to beg him to do a paternity test and he finally agreed after a month, and it proved that I didn't cheat. We had been together since we were 13 so I was devastated and all I wanted was him back, but I've come to my senses and decided that someone who believes that school level punnet squares are the be all and end all of biological inheritance is not the type of person I wanna be with. I was also treated like crap by everyone but my older brother, Alex, while we were waiting for the results because they all thought I had cheated. It was a horrible experience and as a result, I've lost many friends and family members.Since the results came back, my ex has been begging me to get back with him. I moved in with Alex after we split, and he comes almost everyday to beg me to get back with him. My in laws have also been harassing me too, especially my MIL who has come over four times in the past week asking me to forgive her son and to 'let God back into my heart'. I used to be a Christian and so are all my in laws and my family, but how I was treated when my baby was born made me lose faith fast. The whole church community treated me like trash during this whole ordeal and it made me want nothing to do with them anymore and I don't want to raise my son in that sort of community.Yesterday, my MIL turned up to Alex's when he wasn't here, and she had the pastor from the church I used to attend with them. They practically forced their way in, and I was being berated like a child for not forgiving my ex's 'lapse in judgement'. The pastor basically sat there and said I would be going to hell if I didn't take my ex back. I excused myself to use the bathroom, and called the police. Pastor and MIL were escorted out.Now, I'm being harassed on social media and being called and texted by literally everyone that knows both me and my ex and his family.

Despite being only a year apart in age, our daughters were completely different and that’s why I’m here.My daughter has always been athletic and outgoing. Growing up, she played basketball, softball, soccer, volleyball, and even golf. In middle school, she picked up tennis and never looked back. I paid for her to have private lessons and when she found out how much I was paying for those lessons, she decided that’s what she wants to do as her teenage job. She’s now a junior, is one of the best players on her HS team, and teaching tennis lessons. She teaches elementary school kids and charges $75 per hour per kid. With her skills and outgoing personality, she has a waiting list of kids and makes about $1,200 a week. She could make more but I limit her hours so that she can concentrate on school.My stepdaughter is reserved and not very athletic. We always tried to sign her up to the same sport and team with my daughter but she either objected or quit a couple of weeks in. I get it, sports is not for everyone so I never made her feel bad about it. She recently turned 16 and got a job at a burger place nearby. She’s making $13 an hour and brings home less than $200 a week.My daughter recently decided that she wants to be independent by buying her clothes and electronics with her own money. Obviously she can afford the latest styles and gadgets. She recently brought herself the top of the line Mac. My stepdaughter is jealous of her sister and have been very vocal about it.While we were bed last night, my wife said it was unfair one is making so much more than the other. I answered that there’s nothing we can do about it and it’s a good life lesson for the girls. My wife then suggested we have my daughter use her money to help my stepdaughter buy the same things or we cover the pay difference between the girls. I laughed because I thought she was joking but she wasn’t. We whisper argued for about an hour before we went to sleep. This morning she brought it up again and accused said I’m refusing because I’m playing favorites and that’s an AH move for a parent. We argued until we had to leave for work.Update: Thanks for reading my post and giving me your input. I’ve read through most of the replies during my lunch and I’ll get through the rest after work. I’ll answer some common questions.We tried to sign my stepdaughter up for the same sports as my daughter because we thought it would be a bonding experience. We also wanted to get her out of the house and meet people because she spends most of her time in her room playing world of warcraft. We didn’t make her participate but asked that she try things for at least a couple of weeks then she could quit if she wanted to. We tried to get her to sign up for things that she enjoys but she always refuses.

Over the past few years my 23m son has been genuinely upset that I will not transfer my GI BILL to him. Those unfamiliar with the military, service members are able to transfer their education benefits to their spouse or children after serving a certain amount of time. However, I accidentally exhausted my GI BILL.  My daughter and oldest son never really showed interest in college, nor were my sons grades of the best.  Once my son moved out after HS our communication was minimal. Our relationship prior to him moving out was alao strained. As a parent, I hope I am not the only one to say my son and I just did not get along and could never seem to connect as he got older and got worse the older he got. About two years ago of him going no contact he messeged me, not to ask how we were doing or anything, but straight to the point that its my fault that he no longer qualifies for grants due to our incomes combined and why I did not transfer my GI BILL to him. I Informed him that I had exhausted it and that he is more than welcome to speak to a recruiter.  He then said I should have set 50-100 aside each month to pay for his college. At this point I call him entitled and told him I don't owe him anything once he moved out of my household.  (Summerized conversation) We go no contact again for a little over a year and recently another messege straight to the point asking how I exhausted my GI BILL, again told him he can go see a recruiter about it. Non,the less this conversation still ended on that I should be responsible for his college.  Let it be clear, before I joined the army I was a single parent having my first child at 17, living in poverty making less that 11k a year. I joined the army at 25, paying for college tuition out of pocket was never an option. I did the best I could as a parent and I know I would never win mother of the year. In both conversation I did apologize for the mistakes I made along the way. As, it's clear they bother him, but this conversation ended with him stating he does not view me as his mother and blocked me on everything. He made it clear to his sister that he does not view me as his mother and I am nothing more than an egg donor.It is time for me to update my life insurance and do a will and I am considering excluding him.

I've never felt the same excitement for weddings and kids and such things, even though i do want it at some point, and since I'm a lesbian in an homophobic family, i long ago accepted that a big fancy wedding with my father walking me down the aisle isn't part of the plan. This doesn't sadden me much, but my sister (who's the only one in my family who know about my sexuality) has been convinced that I'm jealous of her since she started dating her fiancé.The dinner started out great, but after the main course, my family and relatives started asking about my dating life. It was pretty harmless questions at first, such as \"when are you getting a boyfriend?\" and \"why aren't you dating? I saw that boy hitting on you just yesterday!\" It annoyed me, but my sister seemed even more annoyed. After dessert, when the alcohol started kicking in, the questions got a little out of hand. My mom said \"I can't believe your sister got engaged first, you've always been more social!\" and my grandma commented on that I was \"the more attractive sister\". My sister obviously got hurt by this, and I caught her crying in the bathroom at one point. I tried to talk to her, but all she said was \"Happy?

My wife is 39 and struggles a lot of with insecurity. to remedy this she has surrounded herself with friends who truthfully she thinks lesser of.

I think it's important to mention that because we live in a area were the houses aren't right next to each other and you can't see inside our house even for the furthest point of our yard. So me and my husband tend to hangout just in underwear or sometimes naked. So I was shocked to find her there just using our pool so confortably. My nabour has been mad to me since and she has bad mouthed me to others in the nobourhood. I told my husband and my parents about this. My husband and my dad think what I did was reasonable but my mom told me  that I should have been more understanding to her since she works hard and is a single mom of three. But I feel like she didn't care about our privacy at all. So am I the asshole?Edit: Thank you for all the advice. We have purchased locks and cameras for our pool (we already have a fence). Also we live in the US, but we were both born in China and have later moved here, we met in university here in the US. I'm also sorry for my spelling errors. Also we were babysitting for free, but we not going to continue doing so.",

I went over and asked what was so interesting and they pointed to a snake.Not just a snake, but a rattlesnake. They had never seen one before (maybe outside a zoo) and I assume they were trying to get it to strike because they didn't think they'd get bit.I told them all to get away from it and they did except Jack who actually got closer with his phone. I think he wanted to get a closeup video of the snake striking. I yelled at him to get away and he told me to hold on. I took him by his arm and pulled him away. He gave me this angry stare.I told him what the fuck? That snake could kill you. He gave me the silent treatment until his mom picked him up.Then 20 minutes she called me up in a rage about how I grabbed him and did this and did that and hurt him etc and I'm not his dad.I asked her if her sweet angel told her about the rattlesnake that he was provoking. She said what snake. I hung up.She called up again and said that I still owed her and Jack an apology for handling him. I told her to STFU and check his phone and see if I did any of that stuff as his camera was recording everything.An hour later,  my brother called me up and said what Jack did was stupid and he was happy I was there but I still owed his wife an apology for telling her to STFU.

So all of my husband’s friends are also my friends and all my friends are his friends.I’ve know my best friend (A) for 15 years, we’ve always been extremely close and lived together at one point, she’s literally part of my family, she comes to all of my family events, my siblings refer to her as their sister and she just been extremely involved in my life for years. Now, me and my husband have a 6 month old daughter. My dad is extremely wealthy so he helps us out financially until my daughter is old enough to go to school, then i will take a job at his company that pays well. My husband has a job that he works from 7am - 4 pm and then afterwards him and his friends often hangout at my house or at one of their house’s.Here’s the problem, my husband’s best friend cheated on my best friend a few weeks ago, she’s completely heartbroken and since they lived together my husband and i agreed that it’s okay that she stays with us until they work things out. She’s not really up to seeing him just yet. A is a huge help with the baby, she’s so good with her and the baby loves her. When my husband and his friends get home they normally talk until 8 pm ish so he doesn’t help with the baby too much when he gets home, which i don’t mind it’s just nice to have a little help. Yesterday night my husband opened the front door , peaked his head in, looked right at me and A , rolled his eyes and walked out. Him and his friends came in a few moments later and were all being cold and rude to A all evening. After an hour or two my husband walks right up to me and A and says “does she always have to be here? I want to bring (friends name) here tonight.” And rolled his eyes, i responded “if i want to bring my best friend into the house my dad paid for, i can, and if i choose to have somebody help me with the baby that you’re not looking after, it’s going to be her.” His friends just sat there silently and he just walked away and sat back down . He’s giving me the silent treatment and A left and is staying with her mom as she feels uncomfortable being in the house now. So AITA?",

My dad had given me an investor relations type of role at his company so we were traveling a lot and then after that our kids needed our attentions.After our twins were born my wife was bedridden for longer than we and even the doctors expected. Since we had to hire extra hands to do the childcare tasks that involved mobility my wife had some time on her hands.Her mother told her that her friend who proctors at a testing center said that they give GED tests basically every week ( at least across the state of Idaho) and that she should dust off her general education knowledge. She started browsing her laptop and decided to enroll in a GED prep class online.It seems she was better at self paced learning than classroom learning because the stuff they were testing her on came way easier to her now than it did then even though she's been away from structured classroom instruction for many years now.Even after she was back on her feet, she'd be studying for it after she dropped the older two off to their respective schools. I would see what she was studying and it looked pretty rudimentary and I knew that getting a GED basically means nothing and that she probably wouldn't be able to apply it to anything career wise, or commit full time to community college, where I doubt the job prospects for students are that great right now either.So my wife ended up taking the test and the other day she bounded into the room and said \" Yes! I passed, I passed!\"I knew she would since she was doing well on the practice tests and the GED consistently tests on the same rudimentary topics. I did not gripe at her but merely nodded at her and went back to answering an important email from a client.My wife seemed to get upset and I asked her what was wrong. She said I didn't seem that excited and I said that it's great that she passed but I have been telling her that it was easy and no big deal, but if she needed something to prove to herself she knew the high school concepts, I guess the money was well spent.She got even more upset and said she worked very hard and this was the essential building blocks to being able to start a career.AITA? My wife passed her GED test, but she wasn't exactly graduating from college and wouldn't be for at least 15 years. I just didn't see any immediate applicability to her test but I am glad she had something to challenge her while she was coming off being unable to fully care for the kids.",

	"body" : "I work as a lifeguard at a waterpark and part of my job includes managing the top of the waterslides. I’m to make sure no one does anything dangerous like going face first, cramming too many people on one innertube, etc. I’m also instructed to ask anyone who looks like they could be over the weight limit–250 pounds–to weigh themselves on our scale, and deny them entry if they refuse. I’m not super comfortable with this, but it’s much better than risking people’s safety.Here lies the problem: I lift weights, and for this reason I am very dense–I weigh 185 pounds but somehow wear a size 6. Most of my friends also lift and have similar body compositions to me. For this reason I have trouble estimating how much someone actually weighs.This problem presented itself last weekend when an overweight teenage girl wanted to ride the slide. She most likely wasn’t over 250 pounds, but I couldn’t be certain. I’ve gotten better at estimating weights but my supervisor says if there’s any chance they’re over 250 to weigh them, so I approached her gently and asked her to please get on the scale.She met me with a snarky teenager attitude and said “what if I refuse?” She was with a group of teenagers, some of whom were giggling.“Then you won’t be allowed on the slide,” I said matter-of-factly.She rolled her eyes and got on the scale, and her weight wasn’t even close to 250 so I felt kind of bad. She then said “See?” and went along with her friends.Although she gave me attitude I could tell she was embarrassed. Her face was red as she went back to her friends, who were all thin. I asked my supervisor how he would have handled the situation and he said I did the right thing, that it’s better to hurt someone’s feelings than break someone’s bones.However, yesterday I was called into the office of the owner of the waterpark. She told me she received an angry email from a parent about how I embarrassed their child in front of her friends. I explained to her that I was just following protocol and she asked me how much the girl actually weighed. I gave her the answer and she laughed at me and told me I could never get a job as a weight guesser at a carnival and that I need to do my job better. My supervisor is backing me up and saying I was doing what he has required me to do. I’m thankful for his support but honestly this whole situation is making me feel like an a**hole. I know teenage girls are a particularly vulnerable population, as I was a teenage girl not too long ago, and I could have possibly handled that situation with more care. But at the same time safety is my first priority. Does that make me the a**hole?",

My girlfriend has never experienced pregnancy and she’s terrified to give birth, so any feeling of discomfort she freaks out. I understand that pregnancy is hard and scary, and my girlfriend doesn’t have her family around to help her, so she’s probably experiencing a lot of anxiety. I’m not trying to downplay that. I’m frustrated because I feel like she’s taking advantage of the fact that she can get me to do things for her just because she’s pregnant.We got into a fight a few days ago. She insisted that she didn’t feel good, and she thought something was wrong with the baby. She wanted to go to the hospital to make sure everything was okay. We’ve been to the hospital for this kind of “emergency” almost four times since the beginning of her pregnancy. I had to go to work because we are severely understaffed, so I told her that if she still didn’t feel good tonight we could go make sure everything was okay. She got upset with me, and she told me that I never take her pain serious. I told her that I can’t drop everything any time she feels any discomfort. Pregnancy is uncomfortable. We argued some more then I left for work. When I got home I asked if she was feeling better, but she wouldn’t tell me. She has stopped talking to me about her pregnancy now, and I feel like she is being manipulative.

	"body" : "Repost since I accidentally posted this on my main account and I'm pretty sure my SIL uses Reddit.I (40f) am South Asian and my husband \"Luke\" (42m) and the rest of his family are white. We have a beautiful daughter, \"Amara\" (14f) who has decided to start wearing bindis in day-to-day life two months ago (Before anyone asks, no I didn't pressure her into this decision. This was all on her own and I don't even wear bindis daily). I helped her buy a bindi bag and Amara had carried it around with her whenever she'd be gone from home from more than a day ever since.Last weekend, I let Amara go to my SIL \"Bree\" (45f)'s house. Bree has two kids, \"Danielle\" (15f) and \"Chase\" (13m). Saturday afternoon, Amara called me crying and told me that Danielle and Chase had been teasing her about the \"dots\" on her forehead since Friday.That morning, Danielle and Chase had grabbed the bag out of her room and dumped it into the pool as a \"prank\". It sank to the bottom, and since Amara can't swim, she wasn't able to grab it.Amara went to Bree and told her what happened, and Bree took Danielle and Chase's side, saying it was kids being kids and that they did Amara a favor with that prank.I comforted my daughter over the phone, and went to go pick her up soon after Amara said she didn't want to be at Bree's house anymore.Once I got there, I helped Amara put her bag into the trunk before going to Bree to confirm the story. Bree confirmed it, and doubled down on what she said hard.I was irritated at that and soon left with Amara. When we got home, I told Luke what happened and he suggested not having Amara go over to Bree's house until Bree apologizes for saying that the kids did Amara a favor by throwing her bindi bag into the pool, and the kids apologize for the incident itself.I agreed with that being a good idea, but checked to make sure Amara was okay with it first. Amara said that she doesn't even want to see her cousins or aunt now anyways, so I sent Bree a text explaining that Amara wouldn't be coming over under they all apologize.I didn't get a response at first, but when I did, Bree was telling me that was unfair and that I was punishing her and her kids over a dumb prank. I just replied that I just want an apology for my daughter and that should be a simple request.Bree didn't reply back, but my MIL ended up calling me and telling me that I was horrible for not letting Bree see her niece and that both Amara and I needed to get over the incident when I explained Amara doesn't want to be around Bree or her kids either.Luke is on my side with this, but my MIL won't stop texting about how I need to just let this go and let bygones be bygonesEdit: I ended up editing this since I accidentally used my husband's real name a few times due to getting angry while writing this post.",

	"title" : "AITA for telling my mom she’s making me fat?",
	"body" : "A couple of years ago, I(34f) lost my job due to the company I worked for going into financial trouble. My husband at the time didn’t work which caused us to struggle for money and eventually led to him abandoning me and our 3 children (9f, 7f and 5m). Because of this, my parents (65m and 64f) offered to let us move back in with them for a while.Everything was fine, but after a few weeks I noticed that the food being given to us was both unhealthy and given in very large quantities. I didn’t want to offend my mom so instead of bringing it up with her, I offered to do some of the cooking instead. However, she insisted it was all done by her because she “enjoys it”. Reluctantly, I obliged and just thought “I’ll just leave most of it”. The problem with this, is that she started offering anything I didn’t eat to the children who ALWAYS ate ALL of it since they didn’t realise how bad it was for them. I also didn’t want to talk about this with the children because creating a fear about gaining weight always does more harm than good.This carried on for about a year before I finally brought it up with her. I’ve gained almost 50 pounds and am now almost obese and 2 of the children are clinically obese now as well with the youngest still being firmly overweight. All of them get a reasonable amount of exercise but it makes little difference when they’re eating almost 3000 calories a day. A few weeks ago I watched their school sports day and it was worrying how little they could run. The 2 girls couldn’t even run 100m and had to walk the final part.I told my mom she had to stop giving us so much unhealthy food but she snapped at me and said I should be grateful that she’s even letting us stay there. I hate conflict so I ended up backing down but I feel really bad about the effect it’s having on my kids. Recently, the oldest one has been trying to avoid sport at all costs since she doesn’t enjoy it with the extra weight.AITA for bringing it up with my mom?Update: I brought it up again more harshly with my mom but she refused to budge so I took the kids to a paediatrician. It went how you might expect. They need to lose weight and have to cut down on how much they’re eating. I explained the situation and he wrote a note for my mom explaining the importance of the kids losing weight. After reading some of the comments I suggested I be in control of serving the food so she could still cook but I had control of portions. My mother wasn’t so keen on this so we met in the middle and allowed the children to get their own servings. Although they still took more than was probably healthy, it was less than before so progress was made. My mom still did my portion and it was still very large but I didn’t mention it and just ate it because I didn’t want to annoy her just when I was making progress. After dinner I managed to convince my 2 youngest children to come on a walk with me and my dad. The walk wasn’t long, probable only about a mile, but it was a step in the right direction. However, when I got home my Mom told me she had given my oldest daughter who stayed behind seconds because she “looked hungry”. I told her not to do that again but she was pretty noncommittal so I’m not sure I trust her.And just to clear up a few misconceptions: I have a job but it is basically minimum wage. My mom is also obese or very nearly obese so it isn’t just us it’s affecting.Update 2 (27/06/23) for anybody still interestedI’ve spoken to my kids about how they don’t have to eat everything put In front of them. I’ve also asked my mom is I can make a side dish on top of the meal she cooks. Today I just made a light salad and put it out before any other food was out so the kids wouldn’t prioritise the less healthy food. All of them ate the salad before my mom arrived and were allowed to serve themselves again. They still all took more than I would’ve liked but for the first time my youngest complained about being full before finishing his plate. Before my mother could say anything I took his plate and put all the remaining food onto my own. I knew dumping it in the bin would cause a row so I just ate it myself so I wouldn’t undo any progress with my mom. My oldest 2 ate their portions and the salad but at least they got something healthy into their bodies. It turns out they get quite sluggish after eating dinner so I didn’t push them to exercise today and am going to go for walks with them before dinner instead next time.I’m also in contact with a friend of mine to see if I can stay in their house for a few months before I get a place of my own (hopefully before the end of the year).",

For some fucking reason his wife decides to let their dogs into the room I'm painting.One of them steps in the roller tray and then jumps up on me. His wife laughed it off like it was not a big deal that I had paw prints on me. I also had to throw out that primer because  it now had mud in it. I had told them both to let me do the work in peace.After I prepared a new tray of paint I wrote the word \"FUCK\" in huge letters on the wall. IN PRIMER.For those of you who may not know primer is the coat of paint that you put down before the actual paint. For lack of a better word it sticks to the wall better and when it dries it creates a better surface for the paint to stick to.His wife saw it and freaked. She said I was drawing profanity in her house. I told her it was primer and to stay out of my way.I then finished the job and went home. My friend called me and said that I had really upset his wife with my childishness and that she would not let me back until I apologized. I asked him what I was apologizing for. He said that I wrote a curse word on his wall. I asked him to provide a picture. He said he couldn't since I had painted over it. I asked what the problem was since the word wasn't there any more. He said that I needed to apologize. I said that him wanting me to apologize was in no way the same as me needing to apologize. He said that I could not come back until I did. No problem for me.

I have a very rare and severe neurological condition, which is itself a subtype of a more common and less debilitating condition. When I say rare, I mean a 0.0001% occurrence rate.I was diagnosed in Spain a year ago, before we moved. I spent two weeks in the hospital, they ran all the tests possible, even experimental ones. I  eventually saw a specialist who's extremely well-known in his field. He made the diagnosis and gave me a prescription. I went from 2 episodes a day to less than 1 a month.Now for the issue: a week ago, a new head nurse was hired at my high school. As an at-risk students, she asked to meet me. When I started describing my situation, she interrupted me, saying \"I know [name of the more common condition], cut it short\". Since it's on a whole other level in terms of gravity and rarity, I still went ahead and described it. She interrupted me again and said: \"this diagnosis is very unusual, are you sure about it? I know a very good doctor, you're sure don't want to have a second opinion from an American doctor? .\" She stressed American.I told her that all the tests were ran a year ago, the diagnosis fits perfectly and the medication is working. I finally said that Spanish doctors are just as competent as American ones. I was calm, but it showed that I thought she considered Spain as a third world country. She rolled her eyes and said that I didn't need to get defensive.I told my parents when I went home. My dad (American) got on her side. I said he was free to spend dozens of thousands of dollars (what the whole process would have cost in the US) for the same diagnosis and to get me under opioids. He said I was overreacting and that I didn't need to be an AH about it, but my mum, who's Spanish, understands my reaction given how mentally taxing all this is. I haven't heard back from the nurse, but I'm wondering if I overreacted.EDIT: to address a general concern, I'm not on opioids. What I meant by \"at risk\" is basically just \"special needs\", there's just a risk that episodes may happen when I'm at school and there's a protocol in my medical file that tells the school staff \"when an episode occurs, don't do anything, wait for it to go away\" (quite literally)",

When I bought our current house, it had 4 bedrooms, I later renovated the basement to add another 2 bedrooms. My wife and I have 1 room, the 3 teenagers had a room each, and the youngers boys share the other 2 rooms (with various configurations over the years). As the younger boys get older things are going to get more cramped for them and we haven't ruled out having more kids. I also don't want to immediately take my older kid’s rooms away the second they go to college (and maybe they'll stay local or no go at all), because of this I started looking at how I would add more bedrooms.The property our house is on is a little under 1 acre. Last year I decided I would build a den in the backyard that could become the older boys’ bedrooms. The build was finished a few weeks ago and the boys have moved in. They have a small shared living space that includes a kitchenette, a shared bathroom, and they each have their own rooms. It's essentially a tiny house in our yard. They boys love it, and we had a lot of fun working on the build together.My ex-wife, however, is less than pleased with the boys new living arrangements. She has multiple safety concerns as she thinks they are too far away if something happens and that they will feel like they could get away with whatever as I can't monitor them well. She also thinks it's unfair they will have to walk through a yard to get to and from their bedrooms to the house even in adverse weather conditions. She feels as though I'm pushing the boys away by housing them in the backyard and that it suggests I'm prioritising my new family, while at the same time thinking giving them a cool den in the backyard is favoring them over their sister.I think her biggest issue is the one she didn't mention, which is worrying the boys will want to spend even more time at my house if they have more privacy and great place to hang with their friends. We no longer split custody based on our custody agreement and for the last few years the boys have lived the majority of the time with me, where as our daughter alternates between our houses every 2 weeks.My ex is trying to make it out like I'm a massive asshole in this situation, but I really don't feel like I am.

	"title" : "AITA for refusing to meet my bfs friends unless they apologize to me?",
	"body" : "A couple of weeks ago,  my (24f) bf's (27m) friends found a Tinder account with my pictures on it and matched with it. I have not met my bfs friends yet but they know what I look like because my bf showed them pictures. They showed my bf the account and my bf called me immediately to tell me about it. I haven't used tinder in over a year and tinder is supposed to delete inactive accounts after 7 days, so i knew it wasnt mine. His friend also messaged with the account that weekend but I was with my bf watching a movie at that exact time so my bf didn't really believe the account was mine either. But his friends weren't convinced that i wasnt cheating. I could hear them yelling things through the phone like \"Make that btch prove herself!\" \"You're gf is a whre!\"  along with other really degrading names.  My bf told them to shut up as I was on the verge of tears. I went on FaceTime w all of them while the friend messaged the account. They made me show my hands and my phone on the video call the whole time. The catfisher messaged back and I was proven innocent. None of them apologized to me. They only apologized to my bf which felt even more disrespectful. Apparently, those friends are hosting a party this weekend and my bf wants me to meet the group for the first time. But I don't want anything to do with them until they apologize to me for calling me names. My bf understands but also says that it would mean a lot if I could at least give his friends another chance since they were actually just doing their best to support him since he has been cheated on in the past. WIBTA if I refused?Update: So much crazy shit has happened and I've just been trying to process it all. I don't even think yall are going to believe what went down.After reading through the comments on my last post, I told my bf again that I was not going to the party because I felt disrespected by his friends and was disappointed that he did nothing to stand up for me. My bf apologized to me and made it up by spending the weekend with me at my place instead of going to the party. He told me that after he quit his job, he would not contact any of his friends who refused to apologize to me... none of them did. His apology seemed genuine and him not going to the party convinced me that everything was good so I didn't break up with him.Flash forward to a few days ago. My bf and I were laying together in bed. He was on his phone, messaging some of his friends while I was watching Tiktoks. At one point, I glanced at his phone while he was scrolling through his texts and saw that he had sent a bunch of screenshots of my pictures from Instagram to someone. Even from far away, I could tell that they were pictures of me. I didn't think much of it and even thought \"Aww he's showing his friends what I look like.\" (I was SO dumb).So before we went to sleep, I jokingly asked him, \"Hey why were you sending my Instagram pictures to your friends?\" He went white and there was so much panic on his face. I immediately knew something was up and made him explain. Apparently, HE sent my Instagram pictures to his friends so that they could make a fake Tinder account to see if I was really cheating on him. Because he had been cheated on in the past, he felt so insecure in our relationship that he wanted to \"make sure\" I didn't have any dating apps or was doing anything shady behind his back. He thought the confrontation would scare me into a real confession.But he didn't want to seem like the bad guy with major trust issues (which is what HE IS) so he had his friends confront me for him while he pretended to be on my side the whole time. They saw my reaction to it all ( I was literally on the verge of tears the entire call and did NOT confess to anything they accused me of) and they decided to play it off as a catfish.So congrats to those of you in the comments who guess right. The friends made the fake account. I didn't believe it at first because I had no evidence and I hate making false assumptions about people (ironic isn' it?). I also thought that they had no way to get pictures of me since my Instagram is private. But how tf was I supposed to know my own bf was providing them to frame me? Needless to say, I dumped his ass. He cried the whole time which was admittedly satisfying to watch but also painful. Thanks for all the support. Wish me luck in therapy.",

But she is also supported by my parents who live with us and is not doing anything anywhere near as physically or cognitively demanding as what I am doing.

That’s when the other customer turned to me and started giving the same story. I said I was sorry to hear about her diagnosis and went back to speaking to the employee. The customer still kept talking, right in my ear, saying “yeah, I’m so pissed, why’d this have to happen to me?”Finally, I told her “you need to back up and give me some space.

I told my husband that I understand he wants to support his brother but that he's not a doctor so he can't do anything to help really.

His parents and his in laws are helping with the kids so there's really nothing they need help in.

	"body" : "For starters, I (F23) have the smallest chest in the family. My brother (M26) and father (M57) both are a bit on the heavier side, but I have never used that against them before and it’s never been a big issue.Last week my parents and brother came over for a surprise visit and I happened to forgo wearing a bra since it was just me at home loafing in my room and reading stuff. They wanted to stay a while and chat/ have tea in the apartment so I didn’t really see a reason to put on a bra still.Fast forward a while and I notice my mom is giving me a look. I wasn’t wearing anything particularly see through or thin, it was just a regular graphic-tee of my favourite hot sauce and some shorts. My mom told me to go change since it was inappropriate for me to be wearing “so little” with men in the house. I told her politely at first that I didn’t think it was anything weird and I used to wear these exact clothes at our house all the time not that long ago and she never said anything. But then she started going off on a tangent about how I wasn’t little anymore and I couldn’t get away with having them just “swinging around”.We argued a bit about it because I really can’t be bothered to put on a bra during the weekend when I have no plans on going anywhere, but she kept insisting that I was being a terrible host and “exposing myself”. My dad and brother were also on her side (brother more reluctantly) and just told me to do what she wants and it wasn’t a big deal.I don’t know why, but I just felt so done and stressed at this point that I snapped “If I have to wear a bra in my own house because of my chest then so do dad and bro.” I could tell right away that my comment made my dad feel hurt, and I did feel immensely guilty afterward, but I still don’t think I should have had to put on a bra for a surprise visit when they were going to leave soon anyways. My brother tells me that I took it too far and I should’ve just either ignored her or changed for that little while they were visiting. My mom also still refuses to talk to me until I apologize for my inappropriate comment. AITA?EDIT: After reading through a lot of the comments (and boy are there a lot more than I thought there’d be) I’d just like to clarify a few things!When I said my brother and dad were backing up my mom, my dad was very vocally backing her up and enforcing this need to wear a bra behaviour. He and my mom are just afraid that if I am not wearing a bra when they’re around, I probably won’t for other guests and that makes me immodest. My brother just sided with them because he already gets on my moms nerves enough for other reasons so he didn’t want to draw any fire.My mom is the type of person who even wears bras to sleep so to her, wearing one really isn’t a big deal and she often says that not wearing one will lead to a saggy chest in the future. Her comment wasn’t really meant to be a jab at the men’s ability to keep it in their pants, it’s really just her own thoughts on the matter.That said, thank you for some of the comments also calling me out. I will definitely apologize to my brother and maybe my dad since it was unnecessary to my mom’s level.EDIT 2: I am not sure if I wasn’t clear in the post but I live alone in an apartment away from my parents and brother.

Deep down in my heart I already knew what she was about to say and my intuition was confirmed when she said she was pregnant again.She went on and on about how she met a new guy she hadn’t told me about and how nice he treats her and the baby. That she really feels like he’s the one and how she can’t wait for the family she was supposed to have.I basically laid it out straight to her. She hasn’t been dating this guy for very long, and yet she’s already pregnant and wanting to marry him simply because he treats her and the baby “nicely”. He isn’t helping with bills, or providing in anyway. This was not likely to last and she’ll be a single mom of 2. Not to mention how dangerous it is to get pregnant this soon after giving birth.She told me I was being “fake” and that I wasn’t acting like family. That I should support her like our mother is. Turns out, our mother is kissing her ass and only enforcing the rose colored glasses Mia has on the situation. Telling her stories of how our stepdad only knew her for 2 months before he married her and blah blah.I told her that I can’t support her or any other children should she decide to go through with this.

I choose my dad. My sisters choose to shuffle back and forth. Me and my sisters have never been close afterwards. I have not spoken to my mom since I graduated back in 2014 and my sisters have been bitching about it since. My sisters don’t like my step mom while I love her, so they don’t come to my dads much which we are both fine with. I don’t speak to them unless necessary around the Hollidays.I did not attend my older sisters wedding due to the tension so I’ve never met her husband. I’m currently engaged and our wedding is in December. I planned to invite both my sisters for the sake of my fiancé who wanted them there. My younger sister isn’t coming because I did not invite my mom and instead have my step mom involved and I’m happy with that. My older sister pretends to be this big family person on social media so I think for appearances she was going to come. After I sent the invite she called and said it wasn’t right to phase our mom out considering her side of the family will be there. I said I didn’t ask her advice on the guest list. She said in solidarity with our other sister and our mother she isn’t coming. I said great.

	"body" : "My husband and I (29M, 27M) went through the surrogacy process and had our son 4 months ago. We were thrilled when my sister (31F)  announced her pregnancy and we found out we would be having children very near the same time. Our niece was born a little over two months after our son.My situation and my sister's closely mirror each other. Our husbands both work typical 9 to 5s with 30 - 45 minute commutes. My sister is a SAHM and I do freelance work from home.For the first two weeks after our son was born (the first of which my husband took off of work), we would both take partial night shifts. Once I felt like I had at least some of my bearings on parenthood, I offered to take over completely on week nights, while he does mornings before work + weekends. It's a collaborative process and that breakdown of parenting just made sense to me. My husband was the one leaving our home to work every day, he was the one who had to be up by a specific time and make a drive.At 4 months, we no longer have this obstacle anymore (and to be honest, I kind of miss the sweet, quiet bonding time those extra night feeds provided now that he's settled onto a nice sleep schedule and usually only wakes up once.) Still, I think we got it down to almost the perfect science before we exited the newborn stage. My sister, on the other hand, is very much still in that phase and struggling.This has been a recurring problem for her from the beginning. She has been coming to me saying she's scared she's going to fall asleep holding the baby, that her husband won't help her with the night feeds, etc. I tried to give her tips since I've been through it. I suggested she let her partner take over in the evenings (~6 to 9pm) so she can go to bed early and catch a few more hours, nap when baby naps, etc.. She shot down everything saying ' that wouldn't work for them' and that she just needed her partner to do some of the night feedings.I reminded her that her husband is the one commuting in the mornings and falling asleep while driving was a very real possibility, and that I had lived through it and so could she. I then offered to watch her daughter for a few days so she could catch up on sleep. She took major offense to both of these things. She said I was belittling her experience and acting like I was a better parent. She said I couldn't truly empathize with her or give her valuable tips since she had been pregnant and I hadn't, and that me offering to watch my niece just felt like me saying she needed help raising her own daughter.My intentions were definitely not malicious and I'd like some outside perspective here. AITA?EDIT: I'm a man. Saw some people calling a woman in the comments, just wanted to clarify.Small update here! But the TL;dr of it all is that I have apologized because I was definitely the asshole for those comments, even if I didn't intend to be. My sister accepted said apology and hopefully moving forward I can truly be the listening ear she needed and not someone who offers solutions that weren't asked for, especially when our circumstances aren't all that similar. My husband has clearly been taking on MANY more parenting duties than hers, and she and my niece both deserves better than that.EDIT: Since POO mode has been activated, I can no longer comment without specifically messaging the mods to get them to approve said comment. I don't really feel like bothering them over and over again, so as much as I would like to continue engaging I think I'll just leave things here. I appreciate all the feedback, though.

	"body" : "My sister Rae F42 was trying to have a kid for a long time but struggled with infertility. After years of trying and money spent on fertility clinics, she finally had a “miracle baby”, Sue F12. Since Rae and her husband view Sue’s existence as a miracle, they treat her as one. From the time she could vocalize her wants, she got everything she wanted. As a result, Sue is kind of a nightmare. Whenever our family gets together, we have to do whatever she wants. We have to eat whatever she wants to eat, watch whatever movies she wants to watch, and we can’t do anything outside even though the rest of the family loves the outdoors, because Sue hates nature and will literally scream if she gets so much as a speck of dirt on her shoe. We had to stop doing Christmas together because she would throw  tantrums if my kids got something she wanted.I keep telling Rae that she is only setting Sue up for failure by spoiling her. Sue has no friends at her school because she doesn’t understand that other kids aren’t going to give her whatever she wants because they don’t see her as a miracle the way her parents do. She also has a bunch of mannerisms that other kids that age grew out of years ago. She still picks her nose in public, still whines and whimpers when things don’t go her way, still shops at Justice, and still believes in Santa and the Easter Bunny. Rae won’t listen to me, and says I should let kids be kids, ignoring the fact that Sue will be a teenager soon.Last weekend we were all gathered at my parents’ house and Sue was writing a letter to Santa like she did every year. Of course, it was pages and pages long with a list of the most outrageous things a 12 year old could think of. I wasn’t planning on saying anything–I never do–but one day, while Rae was away, Sue and my son Finn M9 came running to me. Sue clearly had been crying and Finn looked rather smug. They both asked me if Santa was real. Normally Sue would never ask me to resolve issues, but her parents weren’t there, and I wasn’t going to coddle her the way her parents did. I said Santa wasn’t real.The minute Rae got home, Sue ran to her crying and screaming that I told her Santa wasn’t real. Rae tried to calm her down and told her of course Santa was real and I was lying. When Rae put Sue down for a nap (yes, you read that right), she scolded me. She said I had no business trying to parent her child. I then told her that she wasn’t parenting her child so someone had to. Maybe the first step to self awareness for her is learning Santa isn’t real. I was hoping Rae would wake up and see the reality of the situation, but now she’s just ignoring my texts and calls. When I told my husband about everything, he wasn’t as supportive as I thought he would be. He agrees Sue is unbearable, but it’s not my place to fix that, and what I did probably did more harm than good. Should I have just said Santa was real and not gotten involved in this situation?",

No one ran this by me, I would have said no.  I pulled him aside and told him the dog had to go.  He says if the dog has to go, she has to go, and then I have to go to.  I just say, come on man, you should know better than to bring a dog to my house.  He said that its a service animal,  Apparently for Diabetes.  He thought it would be different.  I said no, it might medically help her, but its still a fucking animal.  He starts arguing but maintain my stance. I offered to keep it in the garage with the AC on.   He goes and talks to his girl and she looks annoyed, I felt bad about that.  They opt to leave.  He lets me know i'm an asshole.  My friends were all split on how I handled it.  AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for not keeping up with my wife’s cleaning demands?",
	"body" : "I had a major fight with my wife a few hours ago and I strongly think I’m in the right but she is so angry I almost feel like I’m the one crazy. I’ll provide context. I married my wife 3 years ago but we have been together 6. One important thing to note is she’s extremely clean. I regret not moving in together until we married because while I knew she was clean I didn’t know the full extent. Let this be a lesson to live with your partner before marriage. She is the reason why our house looks like a model home. She hates dishes in the sink while I’m content to let them sit for a couple days. She spends her off days scrubbing bathrooms because in her mind they should be cleaned weekly. She doesn’t let me bring my shoes inside and insists I shower immediately when I get home before laying in bed. There are a million more things but hopefully you have an idea.This didn’t start hurting our marriage until we had kids. We have a 2 year old and a 1 year old. I’m a SAHD. I left work when our youngest was born and that is when our disagreement on how clean the home needs to be started to get bad. She expects me to do most of the chores now when it used to be primarily her and I wouldn’t mind if they were reasonable. She wants the children to have a bath everyday and I think every 1-3 days is fine. She wants all of their toys put away by the end of the day and I think there is no point when it will be a mess again. She wants the dishes done daily. She wants all house bedding washed weekly. She wants me to vacuum weekly. She wants me to mop every 3-4 days since in her logic the kids spend a lot of time playing on the floor. They will not be hurt or sick if I mop every 2 weeks. Because I don’t play along with most of her demands she ends up being the one to do most of the housework when she gets home or her rare off days.She works 40-80 hours/week so it is a lot but she does it to herself. I feel I do what is reasonable. This all built up to today. She got home and saw I hadn’t yet washed the dishes and there was still grease/food in some of the pans and on the countertop. Also I hadn’t yet brought in the trash cans from the previous two days when they were emptied. She flew off the handle calling me lazy and a slob. She said she would like for me to return to work since in her eyes I’m doing a poor job and use the money to hire a weekly housekeeper and a nanny who “wouldn’t leave the kids in pjs all day.” I got pissed and told her she is crazy and she works herself up over small things and I will not be leaving my kids with a stranger. She packed a bag for herself and our babies and to her mom’s house. I’m furious. Am I the asshole?Edit: so I’m the asshole. The common belief is I need to help more around the house. I’ll see what I can do and apologize to my wife. Thanks.",

	"title" : "AITA Refusing to pitch in money toward my sister-in-law’s IVF treatments and telling her and my brother that their future children are not my responsibility?",
	"body" : "(Throwaway-I don’t plan to stay on Reddit)My brother Reid and sister-in-law Nora have always wanted children. However, they are unable to conceive naturally. Nora had multiple ovarian cysts and eventually needed to have both her ovaries removed as a teenager. Reid and Nora are in their early thirties and are very urgent about needing to try sooner than never because they say they are approaching an age where IVF success rates start to decline.Because of Nora’s past medical issues, I am told that she will need extra care and her round of treatments will be especially expensive; A little over $27,000. Reid and Nora already have $9,000 set aside in savings for IVF treatments. They’ve raised $1,000 from friends. The rest of the family is pitching in smaller amounts as well. My mother is giving $2,000, Nora’s sister Lauren is giving $1,000, and her parents are giving $4,000. Which leaves about $10,000 left.Their insurance will not help to cover it because they don’t consider it a medically necessary procedure. Reid and Nora have also had difficulty qualifying for an IVF loan as they have poor credit. Reid and Nora are asking me to help because, according to the loan advisor, I am allowed to take out the loan on Reid and Nora’s behalf.$10,000 is a huge ask for me. And the fact that Reid and Nora have poor credit shows they already don’t have a good track record of paying back loans. When I questioned why they didn’t ask Lauren, they claimed they couldn’t because she isn’t single and childless like I am. (They see it as me not having any dependents.) My mother and parents-in-law don’t have a lot of savings, and their earlier mentioned donations were already a huge gift for them.It takes a long time to correct a bad credit score and it makes things much more difficult. And, harsh as it is to say, I don’t want to take out thousands of dollars in a loan for a procedure that has a good chance of not even working. So I told Reid and Nora no and that their future children are not my responsibility. I also wanted to put my foot down now. Because next it’s gonna be private school tuition or a college fund, and that shouldn’t be my responsibility just because I am currently single and childless.Nora was obviously disappointed but told me she respected my choice. Reid was angry, he told me that he would remember this for when I am ever in a time of need so that I will know how it feels to have family turn their back on me. The rest of the family members have essentially told me “We’re not mad at you, just disappointed.” Because Nora worried for years that she would never be able to have children or be a mother. They say Reid and Nora would be wonderful parents, and isn’t right that they can’t conceive naturally (which I do agree with.)However, I still stand by Nora and Reid’s future children not being my responsibility. I don’t think it’s fair that I should delay or give up the possibility of starting my own family in order to finance Reid and Nora’s. AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for telling my sister she needs to pay for child care or I'm not going to her wedding?",
	"body" : "My (f25) sister's wedding (F28) is in a couple months. She recently sent out inventions. I was invited as a regular guest, not a brides maid or MOH since we live a state apart and obviously there's a certain level of involvement and time that goes into being part of a bridal party, which I understand.I want to be there for my sister and obviously I'd like to see her get married.But the problem is... I'm a single Mom. My son is 6 and when he's not at school I need to be home watching him. So being out for hours at a time isn't really in the cards for me right now. My sister's wedding is child free.Since it's taking place in her state, I'd need to commute, and I'd probably have to be gone from my house for 2 full days. I can't have family watch my son since they'll all be at the wedding. And I don't really have friends who will babysit for 2 days.I contacted my sister and asked if she'd be willing to let my son come to the wedding with me, and explained he couldn't be left alone so young and that I didn't have anyone to watch him. She responded by telling me her \"no children\" policy was strict and she wouldn't make exceptions.I explained my situation again, and said I'd need some form of child care or to bring him with me. I then asked her if she would pay me to hire a nanny or babysitter to watch him. She got offended, and said \"children and weddings are both parts of life\" and I need to \"just figure it out, it's my kid, my problem.\" Which sure that's true, but also... her wedding, her making it a problem by not allowing me to bring my kid.I told her she could either pay for my child care or I wouldn't be going to her wedding. Which all she did was call me \"ridiculous\" and \"entitled.\" She said she shouldn't have to pay for my child and that part of being an adult is knowing how to take care of that kind of thing.I think that's ridiculous. Money is tight. Child care is expensive. I can't magically afford for someone to watch my 6 year old and most people would just let me bring him to the wedding.My sister says she's definitely not paying for child care, and \"I guess you're not going to the wedding then.\" My whole family is mad at me for \"not being there for my sister.\"AITA?EDIT: I think some people are misunderstanding the post so I'll be more clear. I'm not trying to force my sister to pay for anything, and it's totally fine if I can't come, she accepts that, and I just don't go. It only became a problem when my entire family came after me for not going to the wedding. I'm not mad at my sister for not paying. I'm mad at her for turning the family against me and saying \"(me) doesn't want to come to the wedding\" and complaining about me behind my back to my parents. She complained about me not going to the wedding as if I was purposely avoiding it.",

Took a picture, sent it to my wife with a couple of texts and she said yes.When my BIL first saw the dog, he said \"He's probably gonna die by the end of the the week.

It's been over a month now and he is still alive and recovering well.My daughter still didn't want him at her birthday party though.

He hasn’t apologized for his remarks either, insisting that he was ‘only being realistic.’BIL was really upset, saying that I'm wrong for denying him the opportunity to celebrate with his niece. I asked 'What did you expect?' His wife then said that I was being petty with the comment.ETA : Before anyone else says that I'm rashly severing familial relationship, it's not like I left no avenue for reconciliation.

While my son was awake literally all night, I read through basically every response.After talking to my husband we have decided to send a photo I took when we got home from the hospital to a large group chat of our families (without my parents) with a text that says “thank you for everyone who has checked in on us! If you didn’t know, we are all home and healthy. Here is our little <name>. We please ask that photos of him don’t get shared around, especially not on social media. We look forward to having everyone over to visit soon as schedules allow .”As for my parents, my biggest downfall as a partner and spouse as been my continual lack of standing up for my husband and allowing my parents to disrespect him (this goes back way further than the birth of my son). Not today, but soon I will be telling them that in order to come over and meet our son, I first need an apology to my husband for how they treated him. Hanging up on him and my mother’s follow up text (which I didn’t mention but she said she would have “let my husband have it.”) right after he became a father and he was just trying to stand up for me …. That cannot go unchecked. We can move forward from there if they provide a true apology, no empty words.Thank you again for everyone’s comments! They truly did help me stay awake and alert during last night’s marathon cluster feeding session lol.ORIGINAL POST: I gave birth to my first baby on Oct. 10When we got checked in at the hospital, my husband and I obviously told a few people - including my parents. My mom’s immediate reaction was “let us know if you change your mind and want us to come to the hospital!” Even though for weeks I said I didn’t want anyone at the hospital. Then she said she was packing and said “we are coming of course! But not to the hospital.” They assumed they could wait at my house. I said no.After 21 hours of labor and 3 hours of pushing, my son was born and we let my parents know. Immediately they were asking for photos. I understand they are excited and already love him, but holy shit I felt they were being needy and not respecting that I was tired, talking to hospital staff, trying to learn to breastfeed, etc.Once we got moved to a recovery room, my husband  and I talked and decided to hold off on sending pictures to anyone, including to his favorite two people (his dad and grandmother) so it’s not like my parents were being singled out. I can’t really even explain why we don’t want to send pics of our son out right now. We both just have some anxiety about sending a photo to someone and then that photo spreading like wild fire to people we did not consent to having a photo of our son sent to so we’ve just decided to hold off. Not forever, but for now. We’ve literally already talked about how excited we are to send our first Christmas cards this year! So this isn’t a forever thing.My parents lost their minds. Blew up both our phones, stressed me out to the point of tears so husband called my dad to ask them to stop and my dad had the balls to hang up on my husband and then my dad tells me that him and husband don’t need to speak or see each other again.when I was discharged and sent home I sent my parents three texts about us being home and asking to FaceTime them so they could see my son via video since we weren’t doing photos. They ignored me.We finally FaceTimed yesterday and my mom told me she had been sobbing all day and it was “torture” waiting for a photo. I told her she made my labor all about her and that no one asked me and husband what we wanted. It was all about what they wanted. They said they don’t understand the photo thing. Everyone else in the world sends photos of new babies. I said I don’t care about the world and I totally see how sending a photo seems like no big deal and our decision seems irrational but you don’t have to understand it. You just have to respect it. Well that didn’t go over well.So tell me the truth, am I being dramatic? Am I the AH? My mom said I probably cried in the recovery room not because they stressed me out but because I was just hormonal and tired.Be honest with me, are my husband and I drawing a hard line over something nonsensical?",

	"body" : "My wife and I have a 3 year old son and we're expecting our second child next year. Both our children were conceived via IVF. We spent years trying for our first with no success and it took 4 cycles of IVF to have him. It was brutal on my wife. But we both felt like trying for biological children was the way to go for us. We tried naturally for a second child after our first turned 1 but had zero luck. We were left with the money for one cycle of IVF which we decided to pursue if we didn't have any luck naturally, which we didn't.Around a year ago my wife and I were gearing up to start the ball rolling on our IVF journey when my sister came and asked if she could have the money to try IVF herself. My sister has no bio kids but does have an 11 year old stepson. She has endometriosis and PCOS and has never been able to have a child. Her stepson is not very close to her and they've had problems with him since the start of their marriage. Her stepson has always brought up the fact his dad married again too soon after his mom died and how my sister is trying to replace her. He ran away from home three times already. They also had the police and CPS on their door because he tried to get removed from their care. Our main reason for saying no is we wanted to give our son a sibling. But I can't lie and say that the dynamic in her home was on my mind too. And I wasn't sure it was a good idea to bring a new baby into their home when things are as bad as they are. She was very upset with me for turning her down. She said she has no kids and we already have one and we'd give her a chance if we gave her the money. I shut her down. I told her my answer was no and it was final.We waited for my wife to be far enough along before announcing our last IVF cycle worked. We did this at a family dinner. Everyone was so happy for us except for my sister and her husband. She started making snarky comments about how it was no big deal when we already had a kid. I told her given our struggles it was a big deal. Our parents told her she should be happy for us. She then starts ranting and raving about how selfish we are to deny her motherhood and to deny her and her husband the chance to have a family together. Our other sister pointed out about her stepson. She told her she's not his mother and he hates her guts so it's not like she'll ever get any joy out of mothering him. I told her I was sorry she could not have a kid of her own but she didn't get to demand we sacrifice a second child for her. She then told me I held her stepson against her. I told her I couldn't say that it hadn't crossed my mind that bringing a child into what is already a complicated mess would be a bad idea. But that it was beside the point because we wanted another child. She told me I was an asshole for humiliating her in front of the whole family and picking a fight with her.

Anna’s mother sadly passed away in January this year. Her mother was the light of her life and ever since she passed, Anna has been understandably uptight and distant. I have helped Anna throughout her entire grieving time. We had been planning this wedding since December, and decided we wanted an ocean themed wedding. My family and I grew up on the seaside and have always been close to the ocean. I made it extremely clear to all of my bridesmaids that they were to wear blue, a coral pinky colour or pastel green. Everyone agreed and seemed to love my choices.Anna’s mother always loved the colour dark, vibrant purple. Ever since then Anna would buy everything purple if there was a purple choice. Anna and me went for lunch a few weeks after the passing to catch up and support her. At the lunch, Anna asked me if she could please wear a purple dress to my wedding. I’m not crazy about themes usually, but since this wedding was themed to support my familys tradition and considering my maid of honour was already going to be wearing a GORGEOUS pastel blue dress with purple and gold accent’s, me and my husband who I decided to call and discuss the idea with him politely told her that we understand what she’s going through, but we really want bridesmaids on theme. To this she looked hurt, and left lunch earlier than expected.I hardly heard from Anna until around 4 weeks after our lunch, despite my attempts at texting, phoning and even knocking on her door, but she’d continue to shut me off. That was until she texted me “What do you think of these dresses?” And displayed many different purple dresses in photos. I kindly reminded Anna that she wouldn’t be wearing a purple dress to my wedding. Anna was enraged. I tried to tell her that I understand her feelings but my wedding is my own special day. To this she blocked me.Anna unblocked me 2 days later, apologising for the way she acted. Well, when the wedding rolled around Anna showed up in a purple dress. I asked her why she had gone against my wishes and that she either had to change or leave. To this she told me to stop creating a scene and that I was being dramatic and disrespectful. Anna broke out in a screaming match and called me and my family “Insensitive, selfish bastards.” She was escorted out the door screaming. Once the wedding had ended I recieves messages from Anna’s family, friends and even Anna. They were all saying how Anna was going through a lot and that I was being an asshole.

But my SIL disrespected the one clear boundary regarding the baby shower that I had and she refuses to let it go despite being told by not only me, but MIL and my husband as well.She insisted that my half siblings should be invited as well as finding bio family from both sides and inviting them. This is an absolutely never thing for me. I did not invite them to my wedding and I have not seen or spoken to them in several years. But she's going extremely hard on the \"but family\" argument.Background: I'm an affair baby. My father cheated on his wife and I was the result. His wife kicked him to the curb and he and my mother stayed together. I was born and they did not take care of me and when I was 3 I was removed from their care by CPS. None of my biological family wanted me. My mother's family were supposedly good Christians who couldn't stand the thought of an illegitimate affair baby and my father's family were \"not in the position to take care of such a young child\".My father's ex wife ended up taking me. I'm not sure why. The fact she was paid to take care of me was possibly the reason. I do know is I was not loved. My half siblings ranged from 11 to 17 at the time and they all hated me. It was made perfectly clear to me from a young age that I was never to call her mom and I was never to call them my brothers and sisters. My father's family were still in their lives and knew how I was treated and they wouldn't even report it to my case worker. I mentioned it once or twice but I think she found it easier to dismiss a kids words. My childhood was miserable and I was seen as a burden and as someone who should never have been born. My half siblings continued visiting their mom as adults and all just made it clear they couldn't stand me and were disgusted by my presence. I just left when I was 16 and nobody ever reported me missing or came looking for me.My SIL knows my background and she knows that I would never want them in my life again. But push she continues to do and I spoke to my MIL and she tried to take over more but SIL insisted that she had offered first. When she brought it up again I told her to cancel the shower and I would rather have no shower than one thrown by her when she can't respect my boundaries.MIL stepped in and is now hosting one but SIL is pissed because she had spent a while planning and had paid for some stuff already. MIL said she'd give her the money back but SIL said I was in the wrong and I should appreciate her for wanting to \"give me back my family\". I told her I had no family until I met them and she needs to accept that my blood relatives do not want me and I do not want them.I know she keeps telling my husband how wrong I was and he keeps defending me but I feel bad about the tension now.AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for wanting to exclude my sister?",
	"body" : "My (15F) family likes to have a movie night, we basically do that on Fridays when my parents don't have work and my sister (19,F) doesn't have too much work for college. It usually happens like once a month. Mom insists on doing it or just having us all play a game so we can bond and have a good time and it is really fun so no one complains about it.Anyways, I recently noticed that my sister (19,F) starts crying everytime we watch a movie. Like not the sad movies or anything like that, any movie that's for younger kids that we usually put on for my other sister (10, F) just has her face tearful. It's usually  random movies about friendship or simple ideas like that or just Disney movies or Studio Ghibli ones. She doesn't cry at all at anything else. I have no idea why. It's also during random parts of the movie that it makes no sense to cry about (like someone flying, or someone hugging someone, or someone sitting in a garden or something).No one else really notices because it's usually dark and we don't really talk during movies. Plus my sister is very unemotional usually and this is so unexpected that even if I told anyone they wouldn't believe me till they saw it (she also makes no sound anyways). It also only happens that my sister is seated next to me during the movies and my parents and other sister are further away so they wouldn't notice at all. I notice because I usually have to check my phone so her face is a bit clearer for me.This week my mom suggested another movie like that for us to watch next week. And since this time she agreed we'd be doing it with my friend coming over I thought it would ruin the mood for the night if she saw my sister like that and it was just not something I want to deal with. My friend is also nosy and knows my sister very well and I kind of just want us to have fun without my sister in the picture.So here is where I may be TA, I told my mom I'm okay doing it as long as my sister is not there. And if she is there then she has to stop crying over nothing and control her emotions for the night. My mom didn't see where I was coming from and told me if that's the case then they will do it without me. I don't really want that so I told her that my sister is too old for this anyways and we could just not invite her from now on. She looked really upset and told me to go to my room. AITA?",

I agreed.I let my sister know not to bring my nephew (3) because of his allergy. (It’s so bad that he can’t even be near/breathe in peanutbutter particles).She asked if I would change the cake to be just chocolate so that my nephew could come. I said no, that it was my daughter’s cake and she can have peanutbutter if she wants. She called me unreasonable because my daughter could have had peanutbutter cake with her ‘friend party’ (she didn’t have cake with her friends, she just had pizza). She said that my daughter needs to learn to compromise for the sake of family. I told her that I would talk to my daughter, but not to expect a seven year old to choose her baby cousin over her favorite cake.My conversation with my daughter played out just like I predicted, and when I told my sister, she called my daughter selfish and ungrateful. She said that I’m a bad parent because I “taught her to hate (nephew)”. She threatened that if my nephew wasn’t welcome, that neither she nor her husband would come either. I said that was fine, because she wasn’t welcome either.I then reached out to my BIL to let him know what was going on and to tell him he was still welcome if he wanted to come. He thanked me, but said that he would stay home to support my sister.Her party came and went, and my sister is still being very distant and cold. This has me wondering if I was too harsh to her and my nephew, or too soft on my daughter. AITA?",

When I moved out they decided to move there permanently.They’ve only been back once so I recently decided to visit them.Mom and Rae were talking and my plans came up. She called and asked why I didn’t tell her I was planning to go to Cali. I said it had nothing to do with her so why would I have to tell her anything.She said it made no sense for us to do separate trips when we could just go together. I said she’s acting extremely entitled to something she had no parts in and I’m not obligated to include her in every plan I make. She said she just wants our parents to meet her son. I said he’s like 5 months you had plenty of time to take him if it was important.Then she cried to mom. Ma said it was a good idea. I said if Rae cared so much she would’ve planned to see them on her own. She told me she really needs this.I told Rae if she comes she can’t ask me for shit I’m not helping with her kid act like I’m not even there. She agreed.The day came and our connecting flight was delayed so we had to stay the night. I was trying to fall asleep. She asked me if I was really going to sleep. I was annoyed. I said “If you leave me tf alone.”Later she asked me to watch the baby. I said just hold him and go to sleep. She was scared someone would snatch him while she slept. I said she sounds fkn crazy and no one wants her kid. She said she was exhausted and had been drinking energy drinks all night but she was crashing and tried to put him in my arms again. I said “This is exactly why you should’ve just stayed tf at home. I told you from jump I’m not doing shit. You already forced your way here now you’re just gonna have to figure it out.” She said “Seriously? I’m fkn exhausted I can barely even keep my eyes open“ I said “Then go to sleep“ and closed my eyes. She knew what the terms were.We made it there but later mom asked if she really raised me to be so cold towards my sister. She told me she had broken down and had a mental meltdown. I said I love my sister but she should grow up and stop being so dramatic about a situation she put herself in. She said it wouldn’t have hurt to help her even just a little. I told her I didn’t help her make the baby and she should’ve known something could go wrong when traveling.We got back a week ago and haven’t spoken to each other at all but she texted me today how hurt she was and she feels like I don’t care about her or my nephew at all. I told her she knew what she was getting into when she begged to come and imposed on my trip. She said she thought I would’ve changed my mind when I realized we would have to sleep in the airport and that she would’ve done it for me. I said “Your kid.

Didn't pay child support and didn't contact me for over a year, telling us he didn't want me to see him at his worst(alcoholism). He said he's started going to start trying now though. Already started going to alcohol rehab, so my mom started taking me to visit him during the weekends.At first it was going fine. A little bit awkward getting to know each other again. Then my dad's new wife and I had an argument.On that day mom had decided that I should spend the night at dad's place. I brought a book with me. My dad's wife(28) saw it and told me I should not read that book since the protagonist is bisexual and it pushes LGBT stuff(if it's relevant it's book 2 of The Trials of Apollo series).I told her she can't dictate what I read since I'm not a kid and she's not my mom, and dad quickly jumped to her defense. He said she is still his wife, telling me I shouldn't be rude to her in her home. So I told him 'Fine. I'm not staying then.' And I left and went home.Mom said I don't have to go back there if I don't want to so I told my dad when he called later on that if he doesn't talk to his wife and tell her she can't censor what I read, I won't be returning. He said what I said was threatening him.UPDATE : Just talked to my dad. He said that his wife was only trying to do what she thought was best for me, and that the only issue is that what she thought is best is different from what I thought is best. My dad said I should take that into consideration and also humour her by 'giving up those books' since she would become a new parental figure for me if I keep up the visits. I asked if he expects me to do what she wants, including when I'm not at their house, and he sheepishly said yes. So I told him that I won't be visiting again. That way I won't have to deal with her.ETA : Just to make it more clear, they don’t intend for it to be a rule at their house. They wanted me to not read the books even when I’m not at their place.",

I have lived here for about a year now, and I let Charlotte out to go potty roughly six or so times a day. It's always the same routine: I open the back door, Charlotte runs outside to pee and \"patrol\" the yard (apparently it's a Pyr thing), and doesn't typically come bounding back to the door until I poke my head out and call her name.About a week or two ago (maybe longer if I didn't notice) new neighbors moved in across my back alley. I had no intentions of interacting with them whatsoever, like ever, except today when I was executing the last step of Charlotte's aforementioned potty protocol.I stuck my head out and called her name, but this time, alongside the familiar sounds of my dog galloping up the porch steps, was an adult human voice shouting something along the lines of \"WHY ARE YOU CALLING MY DAUGHTER??\" At first I thought it might just be my new neighbors getting into a spat, until a couple minutes later I heard pounding on my front door.I opened the door to an angry man about twice my size glaring me down. He said something like \"Why the eff are you calling my daughter into your house\" and I responded \"Your daughter's name is Charlotte?\" and he just kind of kept glaring at me?? In absence of a response I followed up with \"Charlotte is my dog's name, dude\" and he rolled his eyes at me and said I \"better\" change my dog's name because he doesn't want his daughter (2F) getting confused and running into my house.I told him that's not going to happen because not only did my dog have the name first, we also lived here first, plus I don't like strangers making demands of me before even attempting to be polite. What I DIDN'T say but really wanted to say is that teaching his child stranger danger is his responsibility, not mine.He called me stupid and said that a human child obviously has priority over a dog for a name. I shut the door in his face and stared at him through the peephole for a moment before he eventually walked back to his house.This last potty break, I went out with Charlotte and stayed in the yard with her until she finished her business, but this guy just kind of stood in his yard with his arms crossed and glared at me the entire time.TLDR: I think it's unfair that this father demands I change my dog's name just because he chose the same name for his kid [RUDE AND UNNECESSARY COMMENT REDACTED]. But on the other hand, most humans think humans have priority over dogs for just about everything. AITA?",

	"body" : "Context: My brother and SIL had a series of incredibly painful (both physically and emotionally from what I’ve heard) miscarriages before they had my niece Ava and nephew Liam (4y/o twins) via IVF. As a result, my whole family (especially my SIL) make a very big deal out the twins, calling them “rainbow babies”, showering them with attention and affection, almost to the exclusion of the other grandkids. I’ve never really been as involved with this, mostly due to the fact that I live across the country.Anyway, I’m getting married soon! I’m so excited, and my fiancé and I have been diving into wedding planning. A conversation that my fiancé and I had recently was the matter of the flower girl and ring bearer. I brought up the idea of having our dog Mika and our cat Tibby fill the roles.Understand, Mika and Tibby are like children to us! They helped me through my deepest depression, I honestly think I wouldn’t be here anymore if I didn’t have to stick around to take care of them. They kept my fiancé company when he was going through chemo and I had to work double the hours to put food on the table. We love them to bits, and consider them family. My fiancé thought it was a great idea, so that’s what we decided to do.Anyway, I casually brought it up at a family get together, and my SIL took me aside later and asked why we gave “Ava and Liam’s roles” to our animals. I was confused, and she explained that, since Ava and Liam were “her miracle rainbow babies” that obviously they should be the flower girl and ring bearer. She said that it would be “good for the family” for the twins to be in the wedding, and that it’s “against tradition to have animals in the wedding”. She asked me to reconsider, and showed me a picture of Ava in a flower girl dress to “show [me] how cute it would be”. I told her that I wouldn’t make any decisions without my fiancé’s input, then I changed the subject.I talked to my fiancé about it, and he said he’d be fine with Ava and Liam taking the roles, but that’s he’d prefer our animals. I agreed that I would prefer our animals. However, I’m now wondering if maybe having our animals in the wedding would offend the family or go against tradition.Honestly, I’m fairly sure we’d not be doing anything wrong, but my mind has been spinning lately, so I figured I’d get some second opinions.",

Its a good sizeable chunk of money and a lot of donations from family have gone into it as well as her own savings occasionally.We have always made it clear that the money in there is for college only. She never had to put her savings in there (has a seperate savings account) but did so anyway.Anyway, her girlfriend lives in Australia and they are both insanely big Supernatural fans. They have both wanted to go to a convention for years - at least five that I can remember.Two of the main guys are going to be at a convention in Australia. She begged me to let her go, I said no, but the con is set for after her 18th. I can't stop her if she pays for it. (I assumed she would use her savings).I checked the college account to add some in and noticed a chunk of money missing.I went to speak to my daughter about it and she admitted to using the money to pay for the convention. She bought herself plane tickets, her girlfriend plane tickets (other end of the country), both of their con tickets as well as booking a hotel. The con is three or four days but she's planning on staying for a couple weeks and making a vacation out of it.All in all she's taken about 10k.I lost it, honestly. Demanded she cancel which fell on deaf ears. I tried to cancel for her but she won't be refunded everything so I'm hesitant to do so.She's insisting that it's her money and she can do what she likes with it. Claims she still has enough for college and this is a once in a lifetime experience.I believe this has shown her extreme immaturity and inability to manage her futute and money. I am so incredibly angry that she would go and do this.I told her she could say goodbye to the rest of her college fund and have locked the account - I'm now the only person with access. She's said she'll pay it back but it seems unlikely.My wife thinks I'm being harsh and that she's right - she put at least 5k into the account herself, so she really only took 5k (which my mother in law has since said she'll pay back). I think this just teaches her she can pay her way out of messes.I was certain in mh decision but everyone is acting like I'm the asshole.

Cole's mom died 11 years ago and my husband and I met 9 years ago and married 7 years ago. Together my husband and I have a daughter Freya (6) and Theo (5). Cole has never really accepted me as family or the kids. He's not unkind but disinterested in us, but especially the kids. It's not that he doesn't like kids. He's great with other kids.Cole was in therapy after his mom died and we did family therapy together before my husband and I married. He never spoke against the marriage or us having kids. But he's not very warm toward us either. It really shows with the kids more because they really want to be closer to him. They want him to take the same interest in them as he does in other kids. They have seen him with his friends much younger siblings and with young cousins and with kids in the neighborhood.My husband and I don't push too hard. I will take Cole to pick up a video game every few weeks because he loves gaming and I ask him questions about the games he enjoys as a way of trying to bond. We also go to arcades, the pool and we go for walks all together.Yesterday I was taking the kids to a Halloween party and Freya asked me why Cole doesn't like them and I asked what she meant. She said she asked why he likes other kids more than them and he told her they don't have the same mom. Theo didn't really understand most of it but Freya understood enough to be upset. She was crying and Theo was confused more than anything. This all came up because Freya wanted to show off her costume to Cole but he wasn't interested. Yet he does show interest in other kids' costumes.I told them sometimes, when a kid ends up with their parents no longer together and they fight a lot or when a kid loses their mommy or daddy young like Cole lost his mommy, it means they find it hard to let some people into their heart. That Cole lost his mommy and it made it harder for him to feel about us the way we feel about him. Freya said her best friend has a sister who has a different dad but she loves her. I told her it doesn't happen all of the time and sometimes it gets better but that how Cole feels does happen at times and all we can do is try to accept it and respect the way he feels. I also told them it was not their fault, at all.My husband wasn't home at the time but when he did I told him what happened. His parents were also home because they wanted to see the kids all dressed up. They heard what I told my husband and they told me I should never have said that to the kids because I should know Cole isn't being fully honest when he says things about not loving them and I will make the kids think it's true when they're so little and too young to really understand the complexities and I made it so black and white for them.My husband told his parents they needed to leave.

	"body" : "For context, I am a 31F living with my boyfriend \"Mike\" who is 34. Mike has a friend \"Victor\" who comes over a lot. Yesterday, Victor came over to watch baseball with Mike. Victor asked me to pass him a beer so I passed one over but I dropped it. It didn't crack open or anything, but he said \"Nice one, bitch.\" I was honestly shocked and said excuse me? He started laughing and Mike joined in. I was very uncomfortable and genuinely didn't know what to say. I told Victor that I didn't appreciate him calling me a bitch. He got super defensive and said he was saying it \"jokingly\". I said it doesn't matter how you were trying to say it, I am uncomfortable. He got very huffy and said I was just being \"sensitive\" and then he said \"and you're probably going to accuse me of being a sexist now aren't you. Can't say anything these days.\" This was wild because A) I didn't say anything about sexism and B) What do you mean \"can't say anything\"? Can't call women \"bitches\" unsolicited anymore? What even was his point here?Mike hadn't said anything during this interaction until I called him out. I asked why he wasn't defending me and he said \"idk babe you're being a bit dramatic.\" At this point I'd had enough so I told them to leave and they went to Victor's to watch the game. Up until this point I thought I was in the right until Mike texted me angrily. He said I'd embarrassed him in front of a friend by being so melodramatic and SJW-y. He said Victor didn't mean any harm, and it was like how my friends call me bitch lovingly/jokingly. He also said it was uncalled for for me to kick him and Victor out of the house when Mike literally lives there. I said it's completely different because my friends make sure I'm okay with it and don't say it in a derogatory manner like Victor did. Plus, my friends are wonderful women who have supported me for years, not some friend of my boyfriend's who I barely know. And I was supposed to just let myself be disrespected in my own home? He called me annoying again and then turned notifications off.He slept over last night (Victor lives alone) and hasn't come home yet. I think I might be the asshole because it's true that my friends call me bitch, and although it's different as I said above, it's possible that it confused Victor and made him think that was ok. I also didn't mean to make Victor uncomfortable/put him in the hot seat as a guest in my house. AITA?EDIT: Accidentally referred to \"Victor\" as \"Lucas\" (these are fake names and I changed my mind halfway through making the post lol)EDIT 2: oh my god. I was not expecting this to blow up like it did. I am so incredibly grateful for every single one of you who commented and I feel so supported. It’s impossible for me to respond to everyone but know that I’m reading your comments and I’m so thankful. I’m working things out right now, but I am safe, thank you so much for the concern. I’ll add a longer explanation and update later today when everything gets settled. A lot has happened since I made this post so I want to be able to update properly. Much love to you all, I am so overwhelmed with your kindness UPDATE: This will probably be my final update considering the thread is now locked (which is sad). Firstly, thank you all so, so much for all the support. It means so much to me. I'm so overwhelmed reading all the comments telling me that I deserve better, that I haven't wasted my time with Mike, that I'm worth more. It truly means the world. Also, thanks for all the lovely PMs I've been receiving. Reading these comments have made me realize that I'm still young and have my life ahead of me, and I am sure I don't want to spend it with a man like Mike especially after what happened today.Today has been wild. To start, Mike didn't come home last night, meaning he has now spent two nights over there instead of confronting the issue like a mature adult. He didn't even text me to let me know that he was alive. So I texted him saying that I didn't appreciate at all what happened and that we should talk about it if there is any chance of saving this relationship. He sent me these wild paragraphs that basically said \"fine, leave me. good luck finding someone else who will want to fuck you, you'll never find another man because you're just another annoying crazy bitch, victor was right, you're a c*nt, etc.\" He basically typed an entire essay, it was pretty funny but also disturbing. I couldn't believe a man I thought I loved was saying such nasty and disrespectful things to me. I texted back: \"lol alright. have fun calling me whatever the fuck you want with victor, i won't be around to take it. we're done.\" His text truly was the last straw for me because he didn't apologize or even try to talk it out, he just immediately jumped to calling me names and saying really horrible things. I took my stuff (luckily it wasn't much to pack because all the furniture was Mike's) and drove to my sister's, where I'm currently living with her and her girlfriend. I hope I can find a permanent living arrangement soon.Once again, thank you so much for all the support. I wouldn't have had the courage to end things without all the kind words and promises that things will get better, and that I deserve more than this. I was scared to leave because for some reason, people seem to think that women lose their \"value\" after turning 30. Looking back, Mike made this message clear to me as well during our relationship. I felt like I was undesirable because of my age and that I was lucky to even have a guy who could stand me.

	"body" : "My friend (M30) was visiting me (F30) with his son et's call him Jacob . We were hanging out and decided to play some Mario Kart in the living room, while his son was playing a game on his Ipad.His son then wanted to use the bathroom. He's been here before and knows where to go. I don't have hildren, but I feel like children, around 5 or 6, should be able to wipe themselves, however my friend and his wife still clean him up and wipe him.We have since stopped playing and were talking when we hear Jacob call out that he's done (meaning that he's waiting for someone to help him wipe). My friend groaned and didn't get up. He asked me if I could go clean up Jacob. I looked at him with a blank stare which pissed him off. He scoffed and got up to go see Jacob. After a 10 minutes they both emerged from the bathroom. My friend looks livid and says that he has shit on his shirt because of me. (I don't even want to know HOW he ended up with shit on his shirt) and that I should have done it for him. He hates doing it and feels like it's his wife's job. I told him well thankfully I'm not his wife and I'll never clean up his son. He ended up cutting his visit short and left. I don't think i was the asshole but his wife texted me later berating me for not doing this because my friend was having a very rough time. He lost his job and was depressed (I didn't know that) and visited me to clear his head. I felt bad because maybe I should have noticed that his demand was out of the ordinary and done it, now that I know how he felt.Edit: holy shit. I didn't expect this amount of comments! I'm a bit overwhelmed but i'll try to read most comments. This situation is just so mind-boggling and bizzare that it kind of still feels surreal to me. Thank you for all the comments. I'll try to answer some questions I saw.Jacob is not disabled. His mother is really overbearing and just decides to do everything for him, my friend follows suit. Jacob will start school in September (he was homeschooled before).My friend has made sexist jokes before, but he did apologize profusely when it made me and his wife uncomfortable. This situation makes be believe that he was always inherently sexist.",

When the release date was revealed I immediately requested PTO for that date as I plan on staying home that day and enjoying the new game.

I had previously told some of my co workers I was planning on staying home to play the game, and I guess word got around because one of my other coworkers asked me after work to give her my PTO so she can travel for mother’s day. I explained to her that i requested this day off months ago for a specific reason and I really wasn’t willing to change it. She got pretty upset with me claiming I care more about videogames than family and whatnot. I honestly don’t really care about her not being able to travel because I feel like if this was an important date then you would have requested off early, like I did. Anyways I firmly told her no, but she told some of my other co workers and they are pissed at me and calling me an A hole for not giving up the date. AITA? edited typos",

Quick side note, we're both in our 30s and both work in hospitality and worked in kitchens for years, so we're generally on our best behavior at restaurants.Anyway. We sit down and are greeted by a young woman (early 20's) who drops some menus and asks if we want to start with still or sparkling water. I looked at the drink menu and saw the still was $9 and the sparkling was $12. Neither of us care that much about fancy water, so I said tap is fine. She gave a sort of grimace and a small noise.I asked \"Is there something wrong with the tap water?\" She replied \"It's very hydrating.\" Followed by an awkward silence. This was very strange to me so I essentially repeated the question with slightly different verbiage and once again got \"It's very hydrating.\" I looked at her with with an expression of \"please explain.\" More silence. Eventually I asked \"What does that mean?\" She said, with no emotion: \"It will hydrate you.\"Now I'm feeling weird about the whole situation. And I flat out asked, with no expression or connotation: \"What's wrong with the tap water?\"You guessed it! \"It's very hydrating.\" I stood up and told my wife \"We're going.\" Before my wife even realized what was going on, the waitress said \"Have a blessed day\" with the smuggest smile I've ever seen. Am I in La-La-Land here? The triplicated response seems really dumb for someone who is a 'professional' at hospitality.Anyway- my wife suggested I took it too far by leaving. In my opinion, I didn't take it far enough and should have spoke to a manager. But life's short- and I didn't. AITA?UPDATE 1: My wife was cool with leaving. We have a very equitable relationship. If one of us says to the other \"we're leaving,\" or any variation of that, we trust each other to know we made the right call and will figure out the rest later.UPDATE 2: This is in America. I'm from near there and have had the tap water in the vicinity several times, without issue.UPDATE 3: Types of water. In my area, it's pretty normal to have 3 choices of water at a restaurant. 1: Still. This is fancy water in a 1L glass bottle, with no bubbles. This was the $9 option. 2: Sparkling water in a 1L glass bottle was $12. 3: Tap water - free. This option was not presented to me, but is a choice if the diner asks.",

I'm actually using it right now lolSo two days ago, my aunt and uncle and Katie came over for dinner. I asked Katie if she wanted to play a game on our switch, she excitedly said yes so we went up to my room and set it up to my TV. Just my luck, my room was freezing cold, so I set up my heated blanket for Katie and I while my heater slowly heats up the room.When they were about to leave, Katie came running to me with the blanket, asking if she could take it home. The thing is, they have two dogs who ruin stuff in 2 seconds, while she doesnt take the best care of her stuff either (understantable since shes 8).I took nicely took it from her and said no in the nicest way possible. I told her that it was a birthday gift that Jasper gave to me. She looked disappointed but smiled. She's met Jasper, and aside from her parents and I, he's gotta be her favourite person, and he absolutely adores her. (She's told Jasper and I that we need to get together and get married so that she can see him more often lol).She ran to her parents and got her stuff on, and my aunt and uncle asked why I couldn't just give it to her. I said again that it was a birthday gift from Jasper. They just said that I could've given it to her and Jasper or I could get another one. I don't wanna give it away since it was a birthday gift from my best friend, and he had a hilariously hard time getting it. (He paid for it, but he had to ask his mother to order it, and tried his best to not mention that it was a gift for a girl, since you can probably tell how shed respond lol).I stood my ground and told them that I would not be giving it to them, and they just huffed and left. Later they texted me saying that I was an AH and I should've just given it to her. I was older, and I should've been the bigger person. The thing is, Katie had literally no problem with me saying no, so I have no idea what their problem was, but the way AH was thrown around it reminded me of this place. So reddit, AITA?",

Time, money, and any extra resources were all given to my middle sister so that she could have doctor's, tutors, a special school, etc. From the age of 5 I was pretty much left to raise myself, and when my youngest sister was born, I pretty much raised her too.I struggled a lot in highschool as I also have a mild version of my sister's disability (but it was ignored since hers was much more severe). My parents did not help me at all, they ignored my concerns about my grades, rejected my request for a tutor, and did not seem to care at all that I was pretty much failing. I did not even have time to study on my own as much of my life at home revolved around taking care of my sisters.I managed to graduate and immediately took a retail job that I am still at today. My youngest sister graduates this weekend and my parents asked me to attend. The thought literally makes me want to throw up. By the time my youngest sister hit highschool, my middle sister no longer lived at home, and she was on state benefits. That meant my parents suddenly had all the time and money in the world which they used to get my youngest sister in an amazing, private highschool. They gave her tons of support and she is graduating with honors and has an offer to attend an ivy league college.It may be childish, but I do not feel like it is fair at all. I don't hold a grudge against my sister, and I have sent her a graduation card, but the thought of sitting through a whole ceremony and hearing my parents talk about all of her accomplishments is too much.They are extremely upset about the fact that I said I won't go. I haven't talked to my sister yet, but I assume she will be upset as well.AITA?EDIT: I have seen a lot of comments saying that choosing to not attend the graduation is some \"revenge plot\" against my parents. That is not it at all; I'm trying to protect my own feelings, as well as not ruin my sister's celebration by being negative or jealous. I am not good at hiding my feelings and I'm afraid she would be able to tell. I could care less what my parents say or think.Also, my sister and I are not very close anymore. I moved out after I turned 18 and our contact has been limited. I truly don't know how she would feel about me missing the ceremony.

I looked up and the kid had pulled the table skirt - which was zip-tied tightly to the table - away, stuck his arm through, grabbed the bottle of bleach, and started spraying it around.I quickly grabbed it from him as his mom laughed and reminded me he’s autistic and said he has a spray bottle of water at home that he likes to spray people with.This is where I might be TA. I told her that first off, she shouldn’t be encouraging him to spray people with ANYTHING without their consent, and second, that wasn’t water, it was bleach, and they were both lucky I was wearing sunglasses because I could’ve gone blind. She was really offended and again tried to tell me he was autistic. I said that may be an excuse for him to not realize, but she needs to be paying closer attention to her kid in public places if he’s going to do stuff like that.She hasn’t brought her kid in since. I feel bad because he was a nice kid and I don’t know how much help she has at home, but I still feel like what I said was true.AITA for telling off the mom of an autistic child and prompting her to stop bringing him back?edit Soooo my post got shared over on r/amitheangel and people think it’s fake so to clear some things up…This story is 100% real. I wish it weren’t. I wish I haven’t had several people tell me I shouldn’t have gone off on her. I wish she had had the forethought to bring a spray bottle. I really wish.She still comes in, she just comes in alone.Yes, I did inform management. My direct supervisor that day thought it was funny that I went off on her. My manager didn’t care about any of the situation. These are the same people who let a customer harass and grope me for an ENTIRE shift (yeah that happened) and literally just made me stand there and take it. No one spoke to him. No one offered to move me to another station. No one did anything except stand back and laugh.I’m quitting this summer after I graduate from university. Woo!",

	"title" : "AITA For not wanting to split my jackpot win with my husbands friend?",
	"body" : "I (F30) played the lottery for the first time last year when everyone was talking about the Powerball jackpot.  Since then I’ve played casually, only spending a few dollars a week. I occasionally won a few bucks and never really expected to win anything big but it was nice to dream as I had a ton of  debt and have been struggling a lot.Fast forward to a few months ago (won’t say the month for privacy) I checked the winning numbers one night against my ticket and it matched with my numbers perfectly. Initially I didn’t believe it and thought there had to be a mistake so I told my husband(M35) and we checked it like a dozen times and I was right, we won. It’s Life changing, multi generational, fuck you money.We instantly agreed to keep the news to ourselves and wait a few months before we did anything. The past few months have been an incredible high, filled with disbelief and though it’s been difficult, we have managed not to make any large purchases or change our lifestyle. We fantasized about what to do with our money but the time to claim is drawing near so we have begun having more practical discussions about how to claim it and what to do with it.While discussing, my husband “Adam” brought up that he thinks it’ll be a good idea to split the money with his best friend/ business partner “Tim”. Tim and Adam have been friends since they were in middle school and have done everything together ever since. Together they’ve started businesses, work together, invested money, moved to the same town and have often dreamed about our families making it big together. Since we have take risks together and are so close, Adam feels it’s fair to give them 1/3 of the cash prize so that 1) we are not going on this journey to a new life alone 2) it’s suspicious to make all this money suddenly and more easily explained if Tim “makes”money as well since we do everything together.I however feel it’s risky to share that we have come into this money with them because Tim’s family tends to be more flashy and like showing off and I don’t fully trust that they will keep it quiet or modest enough to not raise suspicion. This is important because I’ve seen community members harass and attack people with far less money just because they feel entitled. This could jeopardize our safety so I want to avoid it if at all possible. Also I’m not really comfortable with his plan to add Tim and his wife as members of our LLC to claim the prize (because I think it could have them feel entitled to a bigger chunk or take the money?)Adam thinks I’m being selfish and he wont enjoy our new found wealth if his friend isn’t living the same lifestyle but I think we could find a way to later give them some money after figuring out a way to explain how we came into money without telling them we won lottery (no idea how to do that yet).Anyway, AITA for not wanting to tell them we won the lottery and split the money? Am I selfish?Edit: Thank you all for your input. I think a few things are clear now to me. 1) absolutely a horrible idea to put Tim on the ticket. 2) Claim the money with only me as the beneficiary for now and change based on advice of lawyer. 3) Find a way to help Tim’s family without blowing our cover. Thanks again for all your input.",

	"title" : "AITA for not telling my wife to tone down her dancing at our wedding?",
	"body" : "Throwaway because my wife has Reddit.My wife (29F) and I (29M) got married last weekend. We’ve been together since first year of uni and got married on the 10 year anniversary of the day I asked her to be my girlfriend. We’ve grown up together, got through thick and thin and I know there is no one else I want to spend my life with.For context, my wife is half Spanish and we incorporated a lot of Spanish traditions into our wedding. It also meant that, with all her family there, the reception turned into quite the party.I was pretty tired after dancing for a while so I went to sit and talk with my family whilst my wife kept dancing with her cousins and friends. After a bit of chatting, my mum and aunt essentially told me that they weren’t too pleased with my wife’s dancing to songs like “Low” and “SexyBack,” saying that her slut drops and “wiggling her bottom like that” weren’t appropriate on her wedding day and were disrespectful to me. To be honest, I didn’t see anything wrong with the way she was dancing - it was nothing more than I think any person would dance to songs like that in the club when they were having fun and had a couple drinks - and I told them as such. They said I should tell her to tone it down, but she was having fun with her friends and I didn’t see anything gratuitous about it, nor was she super drunk, so I told her it wasn't my place. We ended up wrapping up the party soon afterwards anyway.The morning after, we had breakfast with my family and my aunt mentioned to my wife that she was pleased that I eventually got her to “tone down the fiesta.” My wife asked what she meant by that and my mum told her about the conversation from last night (my wife has told me about this, I was talking to my dad and uncle at the time and didn’t hear). My wife apologised but was then very quiet for the rest of the day, and when we left the hotel she was very upset with me, saying I should have told her that she had offended my family and that she was humiliated that I hadn’t told her anything about it on the night, like my aunt had assumed. I was sorry that she was humiliated but I was not sorry that I hadn’t told her to tone it down, because in my opinion she didn’t do anything wrong. She still thinks I should have just told her because now she won't have a good relationship with her in-laws (she doesn’t have a good one with her parents). I’m mad at my mum and aunt and want them to apologise to us, but she refuses to bring it up with them and wants to apologise again to them when they come over this weekend. I want to stand up for her because I think they're being incredibly rude, but she doesn't want that, she just wants to mend bridges. She's still upset with me because I don't see it her way and because I'm not sorry that I didn't tell her. So AITA?",

	"body" : "Me (M36) and my partner (M38) have 2 kids Luke (M18) and Jay (M15).Some background info : We took the boys under our care when they were 8 and 11. Before they came with us they had been in different families/ group homes for over a year. It was hard for luke to understand that they were with us for good and that he had his own bedroom and family. Me and my partner know that he stills sometimes has insecurities about it and a recent one was about him leaving for college.We explained to Luke that even if he was 18 and leaving the house he would still have a room and place at home, be it now or in 10/25 years. That he would still be our kid at 40 and we will always be here for him.Now the issue. My cousin (F42) recently broke up and needed a somewhere to live for her and her two boys (M16/M12).Me and my partner have a house big enough and we agreed to host them free of charge for 6 months until she gets her bearings back. For the house me and my partner have a kind of master bedroom with our bedroom, bathroom and office. Our boys have their own room and they share a bathroom and my cousin’s boys have the guest room with a bathroom. My cousin has a room on the ground floor, it’s not big but she has the space for a bed, a desk and a wardrobe.Last week we got the keys for Luke’s flat and we started the process of furnishing it, he will offically move in next week and will start uni the week after.This week end my cousin asked when Luke’s room will be empty. I told her that it will not be, that he will only take his clothes, books, decorative items… basically his room will stay the same and he will take only what he wanted. She then asked how she will be able to move in the room with all his stuff still here. I told her she won’t, that it will still be his bedroom. He will still come home on some week ends, holidays…She then complained about the fact that she was living in a « storage room », that she was the only one without her own bathroom and that it was unfair of us to have an empty bedroom in our house and not give it to her.Me and my partner were very firm in our decision but my mom and aunt called and told me that it was a bit unfair of us to not offer proper accomodation for my cousin and that Luke could do without a room for a few months now that he has his flat for the school year.I disagree, for me it’s more than a bedroom it’s what it represents. It’s his own place for him in our home and it’s something I want him to have for as long as possible.I’ve been called selfish and that I was coddling him too much over this so I would like an outsider percesptive.",

	"body" : "One of my friends found out she was pregnant a few months ago, and she's really excited to be a mother. I'm happy for her and think she'd make a good mom, but there's one problem; she wants her baby's name to be unique and special, but the way she's going about it is terrible. What I mean is, the name she plans on using is godawful. If it's a boy, she's going to name him \"Daynger\" (yes, spelled like that to be unique), and if it's a girl, she's going to name her \"Tinkerbelle\". I wish I was joking. I asked her if she was 100% sure, and suggested if she was dead set on those names to make them the kid's middle name. When she asked why, I told her flat out that the child would get bullied if she named them that. I know just how shitty kids can be; I got bullied for my name, and changed it when I was 19. She got really upset and told me I was being unsupportive and I was a shitty friend. She's been ignoring my texts ever since, and it's been more than a week. I'm starting to feel kind of guilty over what I said.AITA?Update: We had a conversation over call. I decided to tell her about my experience getting bullied for years because of my name (Shayleigh, called Gayleigh), and it turns out she's been going through a lot. Birth complications run in her family, and she's been really stressed out about it, along with finding out that her boyfriend (now ex) of 3 years has been exchanging dirty texts with a coworker of his. I had no idea about this, and she expressed regret for taking out her feelings on me. I carefully brought up some of your points, and suggested using the name \"Belle\" for a girl, with \"Tinkerbelle\" as a nickname; she thinks it's cute and liked the idea. I also mentioned maybe using \"Dayn\" as a first name with \"Danger\" as a nickname, which she wasn't quite as happy about. She did decide to use \"Daynger\" (still spelled like that) as a middle name, which isn't nearly as bad as using it for a first name. On the bright side, the kid can tell people \"Danger is my middle name\". Thank you for all your advice, everyone. I really appreciate your help and suggestions.",

	"body" : "I (50F) lost my husband 4 years ago. I also have a 16yo daughter.My late husband left me everything and told me to trust his lawyer. My husband had worked for 20 years as a doctor and did some minor investing so I inherited over 7 figures.A year later, I decided to list our home of 12 years and received an offer too good to refuse. With the inheritance as well as the influx of cash from selling the house, I decided to move my daughter and I to Malibu because we always dreamed of a home next to the beach but my husband was exceptionally tight fisted and called homes there money pits.We found a beautiful home by the sea. I never personally handled anything regarding buying a home before so I did not anticipate all the extra costs beyond the sticker price.But my daughter was so excited so I decided to go for it. My late husband's lawyer was furious at my decision so I decided stopped taking his calls. I ended up signing with a money manager who said that we'd be passively earning 90 percent of what surgeons earned per year.But the money manager ended up tanking a lot of our investments. I took the dwindling money out and made my own investments which made it worse and long story short, because of all that I only have around $35k available to me now., not to mention our debts.With the amount available to me, I am looking at only being able to pay 1 month of a mortgage/ upkeep and then I'm basically out of luck until my business gets clients. However, the place where we do have a significant amount of money is the fund my husband started for our daughter. With the money there, I could prevent our credit cards from being shut down, and not have to worry about the mortgage for many more months.So I ended up liquidating my daughter's college fund. I told her about it today and she was furious and said she cannot believe all her dad's work is gone. Shea slo said she won't be supporting me for retirement.

They call us stinky goblin man and gobbo.Also it's my sister not my sister on law.XxxxxxxxxxxI have two kids (a 2-year-old  and a 6-year-old girl), and my sister has a son who is 1.5 years old. She's a mommy blogger and embraces the  \"white, beige\" aesthetic. This preference reflects in every room of her apartment, including seasonal decorations, and she's quite intense about it.I've never said anything to her about it as it brings her joy.Some months ago, I stumbled upon a TikTok channel where a woman adopts a fake German accent to \"review\" fashion for what she calls \"sad beige babies.\" I think it is really funny. It has become an I side joke at our home.During our recent visit to her apartment with my parents and husband, my nephew was seated on my lap. We were playing. I was wobbling him on my lap and pretended to \"eat\" his little arms. As I was talking  gibberish, I unintentionally slipped into the \"sad beige baby\" persona. I genuinely didn't anticipate it becoming an issue.However, when I mentioned \"sad beige baby,\" my sister became furious. She expressed frustration, stating she's tired of people critiquing her decorating preferences. When my brother tried to explain that it was meant as a joke and that she is \"too anal\" about her anesthetic, she angrily spilled her red wine on the white tablecloth, exclaiming, \"Are you happy now?\" She then asked us to leave and has since inundated me with direct messages on Instagram, sending me  numerous mommy accounts sharing the same aesthetic.My mother believes I should apologize for my unintentionally rude comment. I'm utterly taken aback because, in truth, it wasn't even directed at my sister.

Me and my wife have since the birth of each one of our kids put in monthly payments in a college fund for them. The amount in the funds was enough to cover for all four kid’s college education.Our kids all choose different paths in life, wether it was their degree, place of education or what type of school, they all went with something different.When our oldest, Chloe graduated high school, she talked to us about how she was unsure what she wanted to do with her life and had been thinking about taking a gap year. We talked with her and told her it was her choice, that if that was what she wanted she should do it and not rush in to education. She did take 2 years, during these years she worked and in an agreement with me and my wife payed us 250$ in rent each month to continue living with us. She still ate our food, we cooked for her and still bought her necessities. The 250$ were put in a savings account that we gave her access to when she and her now husband was beginning to talk about buying a house.Even though the situation was not the same with each kid, they all knew about this and the plan for how the money would be used. Wendela lived with us for 3 years after college, Emily lived with us during college. They both took part in this. The issue is with my son, he like his oldest sister wanted to take a gap year. We encouraged him to do so, he asked if he could stay with us. We told him yes, but told him about the rent situation. He was not happy with this, saying that he was our son and we should want him to live with us for how long he would need to. We explained what the money would be used for, he said he did not give a shit. He was very angry with us for a long time and ended up staying with a friend of his.This all happened around 8 years ago. We have a good relationship now with both him and his wife whom are excepting our first grandchild. He recently brought up how all his sisters got money to buy a house, showed me pics of a house that he and his wife had been looking at. I said it looked nice, to which he responded with asking when I could give him the money. I told him that he made a choice when he was 18 and that he would not receive any money, he said that it was unfair and that he was young and dumb and should not be punished for it. I told him that I did not have that kind of money to just give him.He left the house after arguing a bit more, my wife and his sisters all are on my side. However his wife and my mom have said that I am in the wrong and I should want my grand baby to have a place to live and should not punish him for mistakes he did as a young boy.AITA for not giving him the money?Edit: When each kid got access to the rent money, it was in a savings account. However, before it was put in a fund so the money grew. Explained it really bad, sorry.Edit: Many people have asked about this so I add it here, he did go to college, I was at his graduation and he uses his degree today. What the four of them choose to do with their college fund was up to them, but from my understanding they all uses it for college. If they did not, then they did not. I have never asked any of them for proof of what the money was used for, so that is my I can’t say with a hundred percent certainty that it did go towards their education.3rd edit: I am very grateful for all the advice and opinions, I will sit down with my wife and ask her how we should go in about this. I may update, but that would be after I at least have talked with him.Also, almost all of your questions or doubts can be answered if you just took 1 extra minute and looked in the comments, about 90% of the questions I get I already have answered one to many times.

It started a month ago when I picked up the Mustang I had pre-ordered through a dealership.

When she kept pushing things I snapped and told her that her son is the last person I want near my car. I then went on to tell her all the reasons why he would never be allowed to ride in my car. These reasons are that he can't control his bladder/bowels and that his stimming may break things.When I told her of this it only made things worse as she only got more upset and pushy with me.

I tried to say this gently but really how gently can you tell someone their idea is stupid?I suggested that she goes back to the drawing board on that one and maybe look at names of lesser known anime characters if that's what she wants.Maisie got upset and said the name is cute and we're both just being closed minded. I told her she asked for my honest opinion and she got it. She kept trying to convince me that it was a good name and the conversation was becoming hysterical and I told her it's a stupid name, end of discussion. She started crying and left and since then she's been giving me the cold shoulder.Our parents told me to just tell Maisie that I'm sorry because my words really upset her and I should've been nicer about it.",

	"body" : "I (18f) am diabetic and I have an autistic niece (7f),yesterday my family went hiking and my brothers family came along, We were walking along the mountains and my niece suddenly wanted juice and my SIL gave her sugar free orange juice, my niece refused it and said she wanted apple juice and guess who had packed apple juice with them?me.I like having something sugary on me incase something happens because yk I am diabetic, my brother then asked me if we could switch the juices since I didn't even need it at the moment,i refused and said that their juice had no sugar and what if my sugar rate suddenly went low? Because mine suddenly goes down so I like to be prepared.My SIL said we were close to reaching the house and she was sure nothing will happen to me in the 10 minute walk left to reach house and that my niece was crying because her sensory issues couldn't handle the orange juice little chunks rn (Idk if autism does that but that's what she said) I refused again and we went home with my niece screaming her lungs out that she wanted my juice and it ruined the whole mood and made everyone annoyed.My brother and SIL are a little mad at me for not understanding my niece's sensory issues but shouldn't they have prepared a backup juice incase this happened to my niece?, nothing happened to my sugar rate on our way down like my SIL said she was sure of but I still wasn't comfortable but Idk how I feel rn.AITA for not giving her the drink?.Edit:alot of you are asking how there is sugar free orange juice and with chunks in it, the brand is al marai orange juice and the package it said 'low sugar' and yes it had chunks but they were very very tiny and not alot but I guess she couldn't handle them, and the reason they packed it is because she sometimes doesn't mind tiny chunks in her drink and that's why they didn't have backup juice with them.",

	"body" : "I posted about five months ago about an argument my wife and I had, and I was determined to be the asshole. Original post here. Recently someone commented on that post asking if my wife has left me yet, so I decided to update.A lot of people recognized that the way I spoke with my wife was full of frustration and anger, which was unproductive but even more than that, it was scary to my wife. u/willoxash had an excellent comment pointing out that I was just blowing off steam and that my priority should be my partnership.We covered a lot of topics in the weeks following that incident. We had a couples therapy session to talk about strategies and communication. I saw one of my coworkers react in anger and frustration instead of taking the time to become calm and realized from the outside looking in just how unproductive his behavior was.And then my wife showed me a section of one of our self-help books. It's called The Five Personality Patterns and my therapist had recommended it to me a while back. We had been reading it together, my wife and I, but then we got busy and we stopped. She picked it back up after our fight and read about the \"leaving\" pattern. She underlined a bunch of sections and read them to me. And I finally understood.I grew up in a house where my parents screamed and yelled at each other or picked fights in order to storm out of the house, and that's how I used to interpret my wife's silence. As a way to \"win\" the fight. In reality, when she became silent, she was terrified. She wasn't stonewalling me, or trying to win the fight by manipulating me, or trying to avoid taking responsibility. She was so scared in that moment that she wasn't even in her body. She couldn't even speak, she was totally dissociated. She told me that even though she knows that how I was acting wasn't objectively scary, that her threshold for shutting down is really low.Realizing how much I scared my wife broke my heart. The descriptions of dissociation in the book were terrifying to me. My wife is the sweetest person, I love her so much and I never want her to experience what she experienced that day ever again. It changed my perspective completely.Ever since my realization, our relationship is better than ever. We laugh and tease each other playfully. We have worked on projects together. We've talked about chores and money. We've even had a couple of fights and resolved them quickly and lovingly. Our communication is better because we trust each other. My wife told me that she has never felt safer or more loved now. I won't say I'm glad the fight happened, but what I realized because of it has been a turning point in our marriage for the better.",

	"title" : "AITA for pretending \"I didn’t know I was adopted\" to make my teacher embarrassed?",
	"body" : "Edit: TLDR at end.Posting on throwaway because there’s enough info you could figure out on my main if you know me.Ok so I’m in high school and this was in my english class. Our real teacher is on paternity leave and we have a long term substitute. So yesterday she was telling us she wants us to write personal memoirs about something very important in our lives, and she goes about listing various examples for different students. She told me I could write about being adopted and how I felt when my parents told me.Now I must have made a face then, because I’m not adopted. I have two dads but they had me through surrogacy. So technically there was a legal adoption for my non-bio dad, but one of my dads is my bio dad, and my bio “mom” is my other dads sister who donated her egg and carried me. I think it would be a stretch to call me adopted, also the sub has no basis to even know any of this because as much as I’ve written in class is just that I have two dads.Anyway, she’s kinda old school and doesn’t like when we talk too loud (which to her is talking at a normal indoor level on group assignments), make any normal faces, and whatever. She basically called me out on making a face and was like “OP if you don’t want to write about being adopted you can choose another important topic to your life, maybe how you help your dad at home?” (one of my dads has cerebral palsy and is mostly blind from optic neuropathy, I did write briefly about that in the intro assignment with our other teacher so he must have left them with her to get to know the class).I was confused so I said “I’m not adopted.”She just put her hand over her heart and goes “oh, honey.”So now my brain which was lagging caught up and I realize she’s only thinking I’m adopted because I have two dads. So at this point I’m like whatever, I’ll just play into it, so I look upset and I’m like “I didn’t know I was adopted!”She’s kind of panicking a bit and telling everyone to just start writing something. A lot of my friends are laughing under their breath because they know I’m not adopted so she’s telling everyone quiet down and it’s not funny and to get to work. I’m like “what do you mean I’m adopted?”She’s trying to tell me not to worry about it and just ask my dads when I get home. And I’m like “how can I be adopted?” So she just sends me to the school counselor, and I told her this story basically and she basically gave off the vibe that it was a shitty thing to mess with the sub that way and I could have just explained I’m not adopted because now I’ve made her worry unnecessarily and embarrassed her. I don’t think parts of my life are up to her to decide what I want to share or not, and I feel like its on her if she feels embarrassed for assumptions she made, maybe that makes me the asshole?TLDR. Teacher assumed I'm adopted because I have two dads. I pretended to be upset like I'm learning for the first time, from her, that I'm adopted. Btw I'm not adopted, dads had me though surrogacy.",

	"title" : "AITA For Not Sharing My Inheritance With My Sister Since Chose To Be Adopted?",
	"body" : "Throwaway AccountI (30m) lost my mom when I was 5. Despite being so young I had very vivid and treasured memories of my mom and did not take to my dad dating a year after her death well. My dad recognized that he knew this would be hard for me but said that as the parent/adult he knew what was best even if it didn't seem that way at first and that he'd thank me in the long run. Not long after that he married my stepmom \"Lucy\" and when I began to act out over it my dad said that parenting alone was hard and that my sister \"Jessica\" (28f) needed a mom. My dad even got my maternal grandparents to tell me that everything would be fine and how I needed to be a \"good boy.\"That was enough to get me to behave during the wedding but once Lucy moved in and started redecorating I started acting out again. My dad had had enough and just started punishing me whenever I acted out or made Lucy upset as well as used the \"Jessica isn't acting out like this\" and to be honest Jessica was easily pleased and wasn't alive long enough to have the same attachment to our mom as I did. It really upset me when Jessica started calling Lucy \"mom\" and it really ticked me off when Lucy started referring to me as her son. I always corrected it when she tried that around me.It got worse when I was 8 and Lucy had her own kids because then my dad and her started pushing for adoption. Jessica, obviously, had no problems with it but I refused. My dad had my maternal grandparents come in again and tell me that adoption wouldn't be that bad but I still refused. Lucy and my dad pushed for the adoption anyway but thankfully the judge listened to my feelings in a private room and denied it. After that therapy started but it didn’t last so they also tried the \"since you don't want to be a part of THIS family you don't get X or you can't come do Y\" but I was too stubborn for that method to work on me.The only one who I felt was on my side was my paternal aunt who kept sticking up for me whenever she'd see what Lucy and my dad were trying to do, so when I turned 18 I went straight to her. It was when I became a legal adult that my maternal grandparents confessed that they were never O.K. with the situation but my dad threatened to keep me and my sister away if they didn't show support. I was furious, so furious that I had my surname legally changed to my mom's maiden name as I wanted nothing to do with my dad and only ever really talked to my paternal aunt.Fast forward to now and my grandma has passed away (grandpa died in 2020) and according to their will only their legal grandchildren is to split a $250,000 inheritance and since Jessica is legally Lucy’s daughter all she got was a framed photo of my mom and a letter. Jessica doesn’t think it’s fair and thinks I should share but I told her to get money from her legal grandparents. My aunt thinks I’m being a bit harsh so AITA?ETA: Because someone asked.It had been two years since the last time she'd spoken to either of my grandparents while she frequently called and interacted with Lucy's parents. Jessica was never close to my mom's side of the family because she'd rather spend time with Lucy's family and/or didn't want to hurt their feelings.ETA 2: Again since someone asked.When Lucy moved in she and my dad took down all of my mom's pictures and got rid of her things. I wasn't allowed to keep any pictures in my room and I would catch heat if I tried to celebrate my mom's birthday, mourn on the anniversary of her death, and get punished if I didn't celebrate Mother's Day the way Lucy wanted me too. So yeah, she wasn't this saint of a woman who stepped in when my mom couldn't to me.ETA 3: Because I'm starting to see the same thingI don't blame Jessica for choosing to be adopted (now). I'm anger at her belief that she should get any money from my grandparents despite never showing an interest in having a relationship with them once she was 18+. They reached out numerous times but she never bothered yet has the belief that she's entitled to their money? That is what ticked me off.My mom had a sister who also had kids, I'm not getting the full $250,000.No I don't expect anyone from Lucy's side to leave me anything nor would I demand Jessica to share. It would be completely hypocritical.SMALL UPDATE: My maternal cousins and I had a meeting and we all agree that since Jessica couldn't be bothered to speak to or spend time with our grandparents once she was an adult she doesn't deserve the money. We had our grandma's estate lawyer spend out an official letter to Jessica. She said that she would challenge the will and I told her she's welcome to do so. I am fully prepared to never see or speak to her again over this.",

We are a healthful household and we teach moderation and controlling how much we take when we have treats. We are also very active and every day strive to get the boys moving.However, Gwen is only here two weekends a month, and her mother has the exact opposite attitude. In all honesty that woman's blood type is probably ketchup. Similarly, Gwen is about 20lb heavier than a 5 year old girl is supposed to be.It makes me sad for this child and her health so when we get her I try to teach Gwen about healthy eating and moving around. We have the boys play with her so she's getting active, and we make a distinction between foods that are healthy and ones that aren't. When I see one of the kids reaching for a \"treat\" food in the pantry I'll ask \"would you like to make a healthier choice?\" And Gwen is really getting it, she's always going for better choices now and is also asking for fruit at home which is really good.Gwen's birthday ended up falling on one of her weekends with us, and while we were talking about what kind of cake to have, I asked Gwen about the healthier choice. My reasoning is unfortunately she's still getting all that garbage at home, and it's just not good for a growing girl. She agreed and we decided to have some low fat ice cream so she can still have a sweet treat. It's a brand Gwen loves and asks for every time she's here, so she was happy with it.Until the next day after she went back to mom. Her mom called us furious, she said then when Gwen got home and she asked about her birthday with us and her cake, Gwen started crying because she really did want cake but didn't want to \"make a bad choice\". She accused me of fat shaming her and her daughter and that I owe her a cake and a big apology.I'm just looking out for the health of a child in my care, but I never said Gwen couldn't have cake and she could have had one if she said she wanted one.

I told her there was no need to and she looked at me as if I was playing a cruel joke, I reassured her that I was being serious and she began crying (due to happiness).I realized that I may have been favouring my sons due to their obedience to follow what I asked of them and was punishing Jane for being herself rather than fitting into whatever I decided to make of her.Jane will be attending Oxford Uni later in the year to take her degree and the relationship between us has never been better.I am highly appreciative of all the comments on my previous post, they helped me see how much I was prioritising financial gain over my daughter’s well-being, something which should have never been a question in the first place.",

During the process I was interviewed. This was in February of this year. I was asked questions about my relationship with \"my parents\" which I corrected and told them she was not my parent and he was only because of blood. Then asked how I would feel about a sibling and I told them I would have nothing to do with one and was planning to move and never speak to my father again once I turn 18.

	"body" : "I (23F) was supposed to go on a girls weekend trip to Spain with my long time friend of almost 10 years (24F) and her other female friend (28F) who I was excited to meet. We all live in Germany, but her and her friend live about 3.5 hours away from me and I live closer to Frankfurt. They decided that they wanted to drive through the night (about 10 hour) and arrive in the morning and said that if I could meet them in their town I could drive with them. I instead elected to just fly over and meet them there since I live so close to an airport.The day before the trip she texts me a link to book some tickets to a museum that her and her friend booked. She told me to book for 2pm, which is when they booked for. When I clicked the link, the only time slot available was 8:35am. I pretty much was like whatever I will do something else while they are doing that.The night before the trip I text her asking her how much I owed her for accommodations and whatever else that we are splitting. This is the second time I’ve asked her since her friend was the one doing the bookings and I just assumed I would send them my share when they told me how much it cost. She didn’t answer but I just assumed she was sleeping to prepare for the long drive. The morning of my flight (3 hours before my flight leaves) she tells me that I had to book my own hotel room because they’re having a guy friend come with them that they invited last minute. She sent me a link so I could book at the same hotel as them for that night, but all the rooms were fully booked. I searched around the area too and all rooms were booked or very expensive.I really wanted to go so I just kind of let it go and prepared myself to spend some extra money for a hotel room for myself in a different hotel, but on the way to the airport I had a gut feeling that I wasn’t going to enjoy myself. So I turned around and went home and sent her a text saying I was going to sit this one out because I was expecting a girls trip.She’s being short with me now and thinks I’m being unreasonable.

I live out of a backpack and a duffel bag.My brother Victor 30 is the opposite. All he ever ever wanted since he was a kid was to have a perfect family. Our dad did the same kind of work that I do and Victor hated it. He was always closer to our mom than our dad.He married the first girl he dated after college and they already have two kids. They are happy. And I love my brother and my nephews. I spend a bunch of my extra money on them because I have more than I need and I want them to have a great life. My brother chose to be a teacher so he could spend more time with his wife and kids. I respect that but he isn't well paid.His 30th birthday was coming up and I decided to do something nice for his family. I checked with him when he and his wife had a free week this summer and I got them a week away at Disney World. I also paid for my folks to go along so they could watch the kids and give him and his wife some alone time.His wife thinks I'm a scumbag because I refuse to get a girlfriend or have a serious relationship. I don't want that. I like meeting a woman at a resort or on a tour. Spending a week together and then saying goodbye. It works for me. They don't want anything more from me than I am willing to give.Because she thinks I'm a degenerate, womanizing, alcoholic, dirtbag she doesn't want me around her husband or children. So she made sure I knew I wasn't invited to his birthday party at their house.I am seriously tired of her bullshit so I cancelled everything. I took my mom and dad on a golf vacation instead. I sent my brother a card with $100 gift card to a restaurant he likes.My sister-in-law found out from my parents what his original gift was going to be and has been contacting me saying that I'm being a dick taking away an experience like that from her family over a party invitation.I told her that she was the one who decided I wasn't good enough to be around her family so my dirty money wasn't going to be around her either. I told her not to bother me any more.My folks are staying out of it and my brother is as well. He knows I don't owe him shit and that I just like to blow money on stupid gifts.",

She was rather rebellious as a teenager and essentially pissed her life down the drain so as a result, my parents are extra strict with me, despite the fact I've never even given them a reason to be.I'm grounded until Christmas with a review at Halloween because I was 20 minutes late home last month. The reason I was late home was because my friends mom was driving me and stopped to run into a shop, then refused to explain to my parents why I was late home ams accused me of being dramatic.Anyways, yesterday was my birthday. My parents asked two weeks beforehand what I wanted, and told me a week beforehand that they had gotten it for me. On Wednesday, I had forgotten to wash out a tin of heinz I had made myself before throwing it in the bin so clearly I'm the devil child. This led to my parents discarding the item they had bought me for my birthday and using that as punishment thecnect day by surprising me with nothing in front of Gillian.This was my breaking point and I lashed out, shouting at gillian because it realistically is her fault I can't do anything or go anywhere. She's why I'm always grounded and if she could have kept a fuckijg note out of her nose at 16 then I wouldn't in this position. I told my parents they're awful people who couldn't raise their first child right so now they're taking it out on me.Long story short, Gillian left crying and I'm now grounded until Easter. My parents are mad, and my dad is refusing to speak to or eat with me until I get my act sorted out, I made the situation worse by telling him he's a prick. AITA?Edit: I'm not my sisters child. I've literally seen the video of me being born and have a genetic disorder that's pretty rare so the idea of my patents and then my sister and some random dude all being carriers is highly unlikely",

I was annoyed by this alone as it’s a long drive and I wanted to get there before 2am.Hour 1 of the journey (with Jane in the car), she requested to stop to use the restroom.

Jane then spent the next hour complaining of ‘feeling sick and faint’.Hour 4, we stopped and Jane disappeared for half an hour and when my girlfriend found her she was just sat outside on FaceTime one of her friends.Hour 5, we stopped because Jane needed to use the restroom. At which point Jane purchased another meal.Hour 6, I pulled over so Jane could sit shotgun as she was ‘getting car sick’. At which point she wanted to debate why marriage is archaic and exists to limit women.Hour 7, stopped for restroom and more snacks at Janes requests.Hour 8, we are on the final stretch to my Moms house and Jane requests to stop again. I say no, we are nearly there. Jane then says that she is going to be sick and we have to stop. I refuse, and say I will pull over if she’s going to actually be sick but we are 30 minutes away.When we arrive at my moms house she announces to my step dad, that I refused to stop the car for her and she’s so ill etc. My mom then shouts at me ‘because I know Jane is sensitive’. Jane is 29, I am 28 so not children.Since then all weekend Jane has made reference to it and told my girlfriend that I ‘can be cruel and nasty and has been since a child’.

	"body" : "I grew up in a very abusive household. I graduated high school at 17 yo so I could move out the day I grabbed my diploma. I couch surfed for a couple of months until I turned 18 and got my first apparent at 18yo with my boyfriend. We worked minimum wage jobs, working 60+ hours a week so my bf and I could afford rent. When we moved in, we only had a bed, a small 30 in TV, my bfs xbox, and toiletries. Nothing else.Over the next two years, we began saving up money to get our first car. After getting a car we applied to a job that paid more for fewer hours. We get raises every few months and profit sharing every quarter. We slowly began to update our apartment. Now, the only thing we were missing was a couch.The couch was donated to us by our apartment. Someone got evicted from their unit and left everything in there. The office, knowing we don't have a couch yet, gave us the couch.After all of the upgrades we decided to start hosting D&D at our house, just me, my bf (the DM), my BIL, and my sister who weighs a whopping 375 lbs.My sister couldn't fit into any of our chairs, so she sat on our couch. We originally didn't have a problem with this until we noticed our couch began to divet in the middle, and the bar that held the futon together underneath started to bend.My bf and I agreed we'd buy her a chair that's built for her weight. The chair just came in, and we had D&D on Friday. We showed the chair to my sister, hoping she would be grateful, we paid over $100 for this. We're not rich, so we had to dip into our savings to pay for this.My sister got mad at us, accusing us of calling her fat. We tried to calm her down, but trying to calm her down just made her scream more.My BIL was telling us to look at what we started, I have to go home to this. You got this couch for free, just buy another one, etc.With my sister screaming in one ear and my BIL talking in the other, I lost it.I said (summarizing): \"Everyone, shut the f**k up! You are completely right! Your fat a*s is breaking our couch. You can lose weight easily but choose to stay a fat, slob. This is a problem you can literally run from, but you chose to be fat and collect taxpayers' money to stay home and eat more and gain more weight. Until you lose weight under 250 lbs. you're not allowed on our couch again.\"I admit it was a bit much, and I should have a better control on my feelings. I feel bad for saying what I said on Friday, but it felt good to finally say it. Last night, my BIL was texting me, saying my \"bullying\" caused her to have a mental breakdown, and I should apologize. I told him I'd apologize when she apologizes for bending our couch.AITA for calling my sister fat by buying her a chair that supports her weight?",

	"body" : "Update: After making the post, I thought a lot more about the situation. I realized after reading the comments that this indeed wasn't a one time situation. Things in our house like face creams, kitchen utensils and even household tools would go missing and I would just believe my wife's excuses. I feel like such an idiot for not realizing sooner, and honestly can't believe she took advantage of my trust like that.  I guess a part of me refused the believe the truth which was how she thought she could get away with it this time.When I brought up divorce she immediately threatened to call the police to arrest me for domestic violence (When I had never laid a hand on her like that) so that I couldn't ever find a job again, so needless to say my lawyer is being called and this marriage will be over very soon. I have also apologized to my parents for all this awful behavior and they have accepted.To be honest, this is probably the best ending and I'm kind of glad this situation happened before it went on any longer. I'm incredibly done with my (hopefully soon ex-) wife and her side of the family (Whose mother called me again yesterday entirely remorseless and called me a childish mommy's boy). Thank you everyone for all the help and comments.Also, to clarify a few things, from what I'm aware, MIL was aware of my wife's actions, especially since she had done this sort of thing before (Taking things from our house to give to them) and didn't see anything wrong with it since neither of them like my parents. And since it was going to be a short visit (Like two hours tops), she thought no one was going to notice the missing ginseng before we left.Background: My wife (28 F) and I (30 M), as well as my brother and his wife went to visit our parents as we haven't seen them in a while. My parents (57) had a box of $300 ginseng in the fridge to be given as a gift for their close friend's wedding anniversary tommorow — we know this because it came up in conversation during lunch. They also told us to help ourselves to anything in the fridge but to not touch the ginseng for obvious reasons.The problem came when a few hours later my parents called us in a panic saying that they couldn't find the ginseng and if anyone saw it. I didn't take it and at first I thought they just misplaced it somewhere. However, they insisted that they both agreed on not moving it out of the fridge drawer for that exact reason. All of us denied taking it and the conversation got more heated when my father started yelling that someone must have taken it since it only went missing when we came to visit.All of us continued to deny taking it, with my wife being really quiet, and my father said that if it doesn't turn up soon, he'd have to have everyone's belongings checked. That was when my wife admitted that she took it. Apparently it was some popular brand that my in-laws mentioned and she wanted to give it to them, and she thought that no one would notice since it was in an inconspicuous place in the fridge.My MIL later called and said my parents overreacted over \"such an inconsequential thing\" and screamed at me that I was an asshole for not defending my wife. The thing is, imo it wasn't a small thing, my wife literally stole hundreds of dollars from my parents and tried to lie her way out of it.While I agree that my parents shouldn't have started yelling and accusing us, I feel like my wife was in the wrong for taking the ginseng in the first place. This situation has caused a lot of friction and we haven't been speaking since coming home. AITA?",

	"body" : "I (38F) live alone in the house I grew up in.  It was left to me by my mother after she passed away 10 years ago.  About 4 years ago, a couple about my age moved in next door and we've pretty much been at odds since day one.  There have been numerous times and issues that we've disagreed on.I have 3 cats that I sometimes let out into my backyard.  My neighbors have a dog that would jump the 5-foot chain link fence separating our yards to chase my cats.  I told my neighbors if I caught their dog doing it again, I would call the cops.  They actually had the audacity to ask if I would be willing to split the cost of a taller privacy fence instead of, you know, training your dog not to jump the fence.  Obviously, I refused as I wasn't the one causing the problem and the fence is technically on their property anyway.  They ended up putting in a taller fence.Then, they asked me to split the cost of taking down an Ash tree that was on their property.  It had become infested with some bug that killed the tree and dead limbs were falling on their driveway.  They had the city come out and the survey guy said the tree was actually about 10% on my property.  I told them the tree was theirs and if they want it down, they'll have to pay for it because I don't have a problem with it.Needless to say, we're not friends.  They've also thrown some loud, late-night parties that included bonfires and loud music that I had to call the cops for as well.I am currently out of town visiting family for a couple weeks.  I have a friend who comes over to my house everyday to check on my cats and check for mail and packages.  I have medication for my cats that are delivered regularly.I got a notification the other day that some packages were delivered, so I texted my friend to let them know.  But before my friend could get there, I got a notification from my Ring doorbell.   I pulled up the live feed and saw my neighbor on my patio.  I asked him what he was doing and he said a package of theirs got delivered to my house by mistake so he was just grabbing it.I told him to leave and that my friend would bring over his package when she comes over.  He said he's not waiting for that and tried to leave.  I told him if he takes a package from my porch I'm calling the cops.  He shoved the package in front of the camera and said \"That's my name and address, OP.  I'm taking my package.\"  Then he walked away.  So, I called the police and told them that he stole a package from me and I have video proof.  They said they would investigate.When my friend got there a little later, the police were talking to my neighbors.  The police must have left while she was checking on my cats, because when she went to leave it was just my neighbors outside.The husband yelled at her to tell me that I'm a huge asshole and that I need to take the police off speed-dial and let them deal with more important sh!t instead of using them as my own personal problem-solving service.",

I was kinda annoyed he didn’t asked me first but whatever, I said okay, next time,ask me if I’m okay with it first.After coming home from work the same day, he tells me that he invited two of his colleagues and that they’ll come with their wives and kids. They have one kid each so that’ll make 2 more children.I got upset when he told me this because 1. He invited 6 more people without asking me first, again, and 2. He told me that I needed to make a different dish for his colleagues’s kids because they won’t like what I’m planning to cook.I told my boyfriend that he needed to be the one cooking because I didn’t want to anymore. He asks me why as I initially agreed to cook.I said I initially agreed to cook for 4 people not 15. I added that it’ll be easier for him to cook for 15 people anyways because he has his whole afternoon free while I’d be working until 4pm.My boyfriend doesn’t agree tho and thinks it’s unfair of me to have agreed to cook just to take it back last minute.I said I’d be okay to help with the kids’ food once I come back from work but he needed to do the rest.He doesn’t want to and even threatened to cancel the whole thing if I wasn’t cooking.Am I the AH there? Should I be the one cooking still as I was supposed to cook from the beginning? Or is it only fair that he cooks for the additional 11 people he invited?",

We rented a van and went to a few breweries/wineries.When we got back, we stopped at a pub to hang a bit before going home. There were about 12 of us so they seated us at a table. People ordered food and drinks. When the check came, one of the guys quickly gave his card and after signing, looked around and said okay everyone venmo me $45.This threw me off because many people had ordered meals, sides, drinks and shots. I had ordered a diet coke (I had to drive 1.5 hours home) and shared an appetizer with my husband. I asked if we could each venmo him for what we ordered and he seemed annoyed. He sent everyone a pic of the receipt and had everyone venmo him for what they got.For context, I'm fine splitting the bill evenly when everyone orders roughly the same thing. But also if I ever put my card down, I always ASK everyone if they want to split it evenly or not, not just assume.My husband thinks I'm being cheap and should've just split the bill evenly with everyone. I know I'm more money conscious than others so I'm wondering am I the a-hole?ETA: we were expected to pay $90 (including tax and tip) for me and my husband, since my husband did have a drink and a shot in addition to what I had, our actual total we ended up paying came out to $53 (including tax and tip)",

	"body" : "Hi everyone, This is a doozie and I think I might be the AH, but I wanted some opinions. I'm a (48m) who inherited a beach house from my grandfather. The house has been in my family for generations, and it has a lot of sentimental value to me. I am now with my long-term girlfriend for seven years after a divorce from my first wife which ended on good terms. She has a daughter from a previous marriage, and I have a daughter from my marriage as well. Our daughters are each 17 with mine being basically three months younger. Kara, the oldest will be 18 in May.Kara has been in my life for seven years and we have a good relationship however she has an active father in her life so I did not fill that role. I was in her life 50% of the time so I have no doubt I played a large role in her life, but I wouldn’t say father, but others do say a nonlegal step-father.  I have my daughter, Emmy, half time as well aside from Summers where I had her more due to my and my ex’s lifestyle. With that said, my ex and I have a good relationship as does our daughter with all of us. Kara and Emmy have gotten along, and they are friendly. They have made plans independent of myself and my GF but they don’t consider themselves sisters or best friends.Now to the issue. Kara will be going to school near the beach house and has asked if she can live in it to save the money which would be significant. Emmy approached me and has said she wanted to live there after the Summer but wanted to live alone while also in school. The home is more than big enough for two, but she pointed out that they have very different lifestyles and would be far more comfortable alone or with a friend if I insisted she live with someone. It was a frank conversation and she brought up the fact that the home will be hers one day, so it made sense, and she’s right, the home will be hers by law in a few years as I will pass it to her.My GF and Kara are very upset and calling it favoritism and pointing out that she will already be set for life between having a free ride to school via scholarships and housing while Kara will be using loans. And may have to take a gap year or attend another school altogether. They are asking me to reconsider, and I think I’ve damaged my relationship.AITA for this decision? I agree that it’s favoritism, but Emmy is my daughter… Of course I’m going to favour her, right?",

He’s been with his fiancée (DIL) since they were 20 and he wants to marry her.I’d always liked her before now, she’s a smart girl, she fits in well with the family, she’s driven, and she makes my son happy. Everything was all roses until they got engaged.Now since I was little I was fascinated with jewellery. When I was older and married and had my own income I started to collect rings.I would “design” them myself, used to ask friends and family to give me cash I could put towards them, and save up my disposable income towards whatever ring I wanted.Edit 2: Okay apparently this above paragraph is controversial. It is the custom of my family since always to give cash in celebrations. It’s also very normal in my community to ask your friends to give cash - I have done this myself for my friends.HOWEVER THE MAJORITY OF THE COST OF EACH PIECE OF JEWELLERY WAS ALWAYS BORNE BY ME. Whatever I got from birthdays was a bonus top up - not something I relied on to be able to afford it.It would be less than 10% of each piece definitely not the bulk. 10% being the highest but mostly it was around the 3-4% mark if any.Sorry but quite a few comments are being derailed by thisI wasn’t buying one every year but over time I have a nice collection of rings. My favourite are a sapphire with a halo of diamonds, an emerald in a trilogy with 1ct diamonds either side, and a Ruby set in a pavé band.After son got engaged and we invited him and DIL to dinner at home, DIL asked to speak to me. She said she’s been seeing my emerald ring over the years and she has always wanted one.She pointed out that I wear it least often, which is true, and demanded that I gift it to her as an heirloom engagement ring. This is in addition to other wedding gifts and expenses we had discussed as a family during dinner. This includes gold to the value of approximately £6000 which is honestly more than my entire wedding cost, and which I still think is a significant amount.This rubbed me the wrong way and I admit I accused her of trying to pick through my estate before I’m even dead. I told her the ring is mine and I can even sell it on my deathbed if I want to; she has no right to expect it and she’s being a rude brat by demanding it.She yelled at me that something like this can’t just be sold, it should be an heirloom and it’s normal for heirlooms to Be passed on while the wearer is still alive.I told her to leave if she was just in my home to demand my property and she stormed out, taking my son with her.She’s mad at me and son says I should’ve just passed the ring to her since I have others and it would Be a nice gesture to welcome her to the family! He says it’s no different than his sister occasionally borrowing some of my pieces.My husband and my daughter are on my side but this is the first time my son has shut me out like this so AITA?(Edit: DIL has an engagement ring already. It’s beautiful and I would call it expensive. This is not a case of her being proposed to without a ring.)",

As we were leaving, my aunt (who was visibly upset) pulled me aside, “I need to talk to you, can you call me in a few days? ”I asked if she was ok, she said “yes, I just need to ask you something, but not now.”When I called to ask what was going on. My aunt said “I heard something that seems very out of character for you and I want to see if it’s true. Evidently, a few days before thanksgiving, my parents told her an untrue story about how my current husband and I met. To note, I was separated at the time from my now ex-husband when we met.She explained, according to my parents: I met (H) while online soliciting for a proposed threesome with my ex-husband as a last-ditch effort to salvage my then failing marriage. However during this tryst, (H) and I supposedly realize we had a connection which lead us to be together while choosing to dissolve my previous marriage. (My parents shared more gross details, but I’ll spare you).I was shocked as NONE of this was true. We met at work through mutual friends and our romantic relationship developed slowly over a period of time. I had repeatedly told my parents how we met, and even introuduced our mutual friends to my parents at our wedding as “the ones who got us together”.So, I FaceTime my parents and ask them why they’re lying about us behind our backs? They look me dead in the eyes and say “because that’s what you told us.” EXCUSE ME?! When I refuted this, my dad proceeds to get angry at ME saying that I must have amnesia as my mom stormed off refusing to discuss the issue. The rest of the call is me sitting in silence, while he attempted to gaslight me. I’m dumbfounded.A few days later, I get a call from my cousin. She explains that my dad had told her husband the same story almost 8 YEARS AGO! Which they had believed until now. My cousin apologized for not saying anything sooner but the story made them so uncomfortable they didn’t know what to do.H and I wrote my parents an email explaining what we had discovered and asked them some simple questions like: Why did you make this up? Who else have you told? etc. We’ve been emailing back and forth for almost year and gotten nowhere. Their story keeps changing, the blame keeps shifting, and they have continuously tried to diminish the seriousness of this issue even saying “no one thinks any less of you because of it”. WHAT? It never happened. Period. The only apology we’ve gotten is “we’re sorry for upsetting you”. You mean you’re not sorry for lying about your daughter for 10 years?Most recently, they have almost demanded that we forgive them and “move on”. Since we haven’t forgiven them yet, we’re “responsible” for my mother crying all the time, and essentially breaking the family apart.So, AITA for wanting to continue to avoid my parents even though I'm tearing the family apart?",

I've always thought that was bs, so I made sure my wife and I were on the same page about not letting that happen.Last night there was a family gathering. My son had just had his therapy session, so we picked him up and drove there. While we there, my son was telling me about something they talked about, and my bil must have overheard, because he started on a tangent about boys not needing therapy and calling him a girl.

We’ve babysat for my sis and BIL before and had no issues until recently.On April 7th, Good Friday; BIL got a call that his sister (28F) was in a near fatal car accident along with two of her friends. She had to be airlifted to the hospital. They weren’t sure if she was going to make it so family members were being called in to say goodbye and support the rest of the family. This happened across the state we live in. Sis texted me around 10:40ish that night, asking if I was awake then called to explain the situation. She then asked if I would babysit the kids over Easter weekend while they travelled across state to be with BIL’s family.I told her no, I couldn’t. I work in a steel manufacturing plant (she knows this) on a rotary shift and after Easter, on Monday; I would be starting the overnight shifts. I told her that I was going to sleep during the day on Saturday and Sunday to get accustomed to being on third shift. When she asked if my wife would be willing, I again told her no; since she’s going to be doing Easter stuff with her side of the family. When she asked why I couldn’t just sleep in on Sunday or why couldn’t my wife take the kids with her to the Easter stuff; I snapped back at her that I gave her three reasons why. That one, I wanted the weekend to adjust my shift in sleeping schedules and couldn’t do that in one day. Two, my wife wanted to spend Easter with her side of the family. And finally, that no is a complete sentence and that’s final.She got pissed. Said we’ll talk later and hung up. They took the kids and on the way, sis texted me that I’m an asshole for not taking their tragedy to heart. For not helping them in their time of need. That “it wouldn’t have killed me or my wife to miss a day of sleep or take the kids with her. And BIL is pissed at us. He prays we don’t have an emergency and need him cause he’ll say “no” and he’ll want “to sleep in.” I haven’t responded and we’re currently not speaking to each other.Going to add: when sis called, my wife was asleep to get up early in the morning to do her family things.

	"body" : "EDIT:  I apologise for the use of the term \"Down's Syndrome person\" in the title.  Several people have quite rightly pointed out that this is not an acceptable term and the correct use is \"person with Down's (or Down) Syndrome\".  This was a careless mistake on my part as I did not intend to be disrespectful and I'm sorry for the offence it has caused.I was on holiday with my husband and our two young boys and we had sat down outside at our favourite cafe ready to order lunch.  A man sat down at our table next to the boys and casually started a conversation with them, largely ignoring the adults, his focus entirely on our children.At first I was confused, especially since he inserted himself into our table with such easy familiarity that I spent several moments trying to remember who he was and where we knew him from.  Then, realising that the man was actually a complete random stranger, I sat dumbfounded a while longer at the serious breach of social etiquette.  Finally, I grew alarmed at his obvious keen interest towards my children.  I could think of no innocent reason why a strange adult would do this.  My protective maternal instincts started kicking into overdrive.  I was expecting my husband to step in and handle the situation, but he didn't.  So the man sat uninvited at our table and carried on his conversation with my kids while I got silently angrier.The possibility of Down's syndrome never crossed my mind.  Any characteristic features on his face were too subtle to notice.  Even my husband, who had grown up knowing a distant relation with Down’s, didn’t spot it in this man.Finally my patience snapped and I asked the man rather sharply to please leave us alone to enjoy our lunch in peace.  The man immediately apologised very politely and left.I should add that I am not a friendly person by nature.  Social interactions can make me anxious and stressed and I have often struggled to regulate my emotions.  Thus I was extremely wound up from the encounter and still trying to simmer down some minutes later.An irate older woman came storming up to me at our table and started making a scene.  She accused me of upsetting her son, who had Down's Syndrome.  She was loud and angry and drew attention from all the other tables.  She, like us, was on holiday with family and felt their holiday had been spoiled.  For my part, I had no interest in engaging with her or discussing my encounter with her son and only wanted her to go away.  She thrust a card in front of my face, demanding that I should read the information about Down's Syndrome so that I might educate myself and be more understanding next time.  I was in no mood for this and threw the card away, then very firmly told her to \"leave me and my family alone\".  She stared a moment, probably realising that I was as angry as she was, then left.  That was the end of it.I'm not proud of my angry reactions and I regret upsetting the man with Down's, who in hindsight was simply a lovely, harmless man who wanted to make young friends.  I maintain that I couldn't tell he had Down's or I would not have spoken to him so sharply.  I still would not have allowed a stranger to sit at our table and engage with my kids but I would have spoken to him much more kindly.  I still think the mother was in the wrong to confront me and my family like she did.",

On top of that several of the older kids that didn't want to go to the reception stayed there as well to keep an eye on everything. As well as two ladies from my church.

Anyone with infants obviously wouldn't leave them there.Boy was I wrong. People were mad that it was so far away. About a five minute drive. They were mad that the kids didn't get the same food as the people at the reception. No, they got pizza, nachos, and fried chicken. They were mad I didn't have someone to watch nursing babies.

He just prefers fries. (Same, kid).Anyway, I took my daughter to my parents house about a week ago. My mom is also vegan so we were eating our tofu and rice. My daughter has just started solids so she was also going ham on my plate. My parents dog ate more than I did.My younger sister (15) had her friends over. They were having burgers or something and watching me with my daughter. After I ate I nursed her and one asked if I was vegan. I said yes, she got this weird kinda look, and asked if my baby was going to be vegan.I just kinda shrugged because, you know, she could be a dairy hating fry fiend like her brother or a cheese-aholic like her daddy. Maybe, maybe not. My sisters friend nodded and spoke to me a little more before leaving.I thought it was a little odd but shrugged it off.

Like yours truly.I thought all was well - my sister sent me a link on the importance of a balanced diet for kids among a few other bits and eventually I called her. I was like, what the hell? And she started going on about how I was a bad mom.I told her to watch her mouth and she blew up and said I was the one with a \"crunchy vegan baby\".So, turns out, her friends are all convinced my children are terribly abused by my veganism, and because she'd never seen my toddler eat meat it was clearly true.I told her to calm the fuck down, explained my parenting, yada yada.She them got mad because all her friends think I'm a terrible mom and I should have been clearer and not just shrugged her friends question off because I should have known what they would have assumed I meant.I think she's being dramatic. They were worried, wires got crossed, all is well. She's still acting like its the worst thing in the world.So, basically, aita for making a mistake and having my sisters friends think I've got a crunchy vegan baby?As a side note, my husband was feeling petty so he went and got ribs for lunch. Filmed little lady eating her first rib. I can now firmly say she will not be a vegan, vegetarian or anything of the sort. Happier than a kid on Christmas.",

	"body" : "I (24F) make a delicious lasagna from scratch that takes hours and lots of money to make. It's so good that friends and family ask me to make it for them for birthdays instead of getting them a gift. Last month I decided to make it for my girlfriend (23F); I spent a lot of money on the ingredients and then more than half of the day making the herb infused fresh pasta dough, the ragu, etc... When she came over, she took a couple of bites and said that she didn't understand why I spent so much time and money on it because it tasted EXACTLY like the lasagna she would make with canned Panzani bolognese sauce and boxed pasta sheets (not similar, not kinda like, but EXACTLY like it). My feelings were a lil hurt ngl, but I understand that to each their tastes and I just told her I'm sorry she didn't like it that much and then kept it pushing and suggested we watch a movie.Flashforward to yesterday, she was coming over for dinner and I asked her what she wanted to eat and she said \"lasagna\". So I popped over to the store and got panzani sauce and pasta sheets to make it because A)- She said my lasagna and the quick made one tasted the exact same, so no need to spend a lot on ingredients and B)- Because even if I had wanted to make my recipe, I wouldn't have the time since it takes me an entire afternoon, which is why it's a special occasions thing. So she showed up at my house, took one bite of the lasagna and then spat it out and said that it tastes different. When I told her I made it how she did, she got really upset at me and said that I wasn't putting in effort and that she was expecting to have a real meal and not something cheap. I pointed out the comments she made last time, and she rolled her eyes and said she was clearly exagerating. So then I got upset because wth?The situation got brought up to our mutual friends, most have stayed out of it but two of them think I'm the asshole because my gf clearly meant she wanted my \"special\" lasagna which is why she asked for it as dinner, and that I should have let her known before hand that I was going to make one using premade sauce etc... I think it was clear that that's what I was gonna do cause she literally asked for lasagna 2 hours before coming over, which is not enough time to make the \"special\" one even if I wanted to. AITA ?To clarify, the \"cheap\" lasagna tasted just fine, pretty tasty even! Just not at all comparable to the original one, in my opinion.EDIT: Just wanted to say I've posted the lasagna recipe in the comments for those interested.",

I do blame myself for that, after the divorce I went into a sort of mid life crisis (although I was only in my early 30s). Over the last few years I've dated quite a few women but I wouldn't class any of those relationships as \"serious\". Six months ago I started dating my current girlfriend.About six weeks ago I invited most of my family out to dinner (my daughter, my siblings and their partners, my parents), I felt like our relationship was at a point that I wanted to introduce her as my girlfriend to the family. And everyone seemed to like her, we had a fun dinner. But then after a few glasses of wine me and my daughter got into this small argument, I honestly don't even remember what it was about and during that argument she called my girlfriend a gold digger and left shortly after. She generally just ruined the whole dinner.I'm not delusional, I know one of the reasons that my girlfriend is with me is money and I assume everyone else in the family knows that too, same way one of the reasons I'm with my girlfriend are her looks. Last weekend I threw a small indoor BBQ dinner at my house and I again invited most of my family and a few friends and some of my girlfriends friends. But I didn't invite my daughter. She very obviously doesn't like my girlfriend and I didn't want a repeat of the last situation. However when my daughter found out she wasn't invited afterwards she sent me some angry messages calling me a \"selfish narcissistic prick\".

I took two keepers with me - let's call them Seth (who's been around as a swing keeper for a few years, has a bit of cat experience) and Megan (fairly new to the industry, brought her partially for the experience and partially because she was the only other one who wanted some extra hours working late).We arrive at 6pm and get to see these two beautiful cheetahs, and Seth helps me get them loaded into our crates.He does ask \"shouldn't we wait for them to go potty before driving back with them,\" which I know is a common practice sometimes, but I said nah, it could be hours, and the van smells of animals already - we'll be getting back late enough as it is. So they agreed and we headed back.It was a bit cramped but we made it work. Megan sat up front with me and Seth sat in the back with the cheetah crates (had to keep them in the passenger compartment to observe them / make sure they're ok).The drive back went fine until right before the 3 hour mark, predictably, one of the cheetahs relieved itself. Seth said \"oh, oh no it went,\" and a few seconds later the smell hit us up front. Honestly to me it just smelled like healthy cheetah poo - I was mostly just happy to know the cheetah we got was healthy! It sprayed too (intact male cheetah) which did make it worse.When the smell hit Megan though she started gagging saying \"oh my god it's atrocious.\" I agreed, but kept driving. Less than a minute later she said \"Please can we pull over, I'm going to be sick,\" I said that it'll be hard to clean this, it's only another hour and a half tops, but she said \"I don't know if I can make it an hour in this.\"I really hoped we could make it back, but when even Seth lost his composure and started retching I knew this wasn't good, and Megan was practically crying, so I relented and pulled off at the next exit and pulled up behind a gas station to clean the crate, but not before Megan threw up. Seth had to help me transfer the cheetah and then we cleaned the crate and Megan's vomit.Then we got back in, but Megan recoiled and gagged, saying the van still reeked of vomit, cheetah poo and spray, which was true. She asked if we could let it air out for another hour, but I said no, sorry, it'd barely help and we need to be getting back.She looked ill and miserable the whole drive back and has been a bit standoffish to me since. I'm not her regular direct manager so it's not really my place to intervene.

I have food allergies and it’s hard to go out so this has been a good alternative.About 2 months ago, an old high school friend Layla moved to my city with her fiancé Lucas and I started inviting them to our dinners.Lucas is insufferable. He will never try again his food before adding additional seasoning which is a pet peeve of mine but I could get over it if he ate it but it ends up directly in the trash. He’ll add a bunch of salt to an already salted dish, take one bite and then say “ew, it’s too salty”. Or dump a ton of red pepper on and then complain that it’s too spicy. And etc. it’s like he deliberately ruins his plate so he can complain about it. It’s probably petty but it really got under my skin. And it bugs my boyfriend too to toss food that would’ve been perfectly good without his tampering.I put up with this for 5 dinners and the. stopped inviting them. I’ve still texted and met with Layla for coffee but I haven’t extended another dinner invite.They showed up this Monday without an invite right as we were starting dinner. Lucas sat down and started filling a plate before my boyfriend stopped him and told him he wasn’t welcome to waste more of our food.It turned into an argument where Lucas insisted he “shouldn’t be forced to eat things he doesn’t like” and I got angry and told him how could he be forced when he wasn’t even invited? Voices got raised and eventually Layla and Lucas left but the mood was ruined for the night.Everyone who was present agreed with me but I guess Layla either told our old friend group or posted about it because I’ve gotten an odd amount of texts from people I haven’t talked to in years calling me an asshole for kicking them out over “my shitty cooking” (it’s not shitty!) so maybe I am.A small update - I received a very enlightening text from an old friend that Layla has kept close with. Apparently Lucas did not want to move at all but Layla was offered an amazing opportunity here so he agreed. According to this friend, Lucas has also sabotaged happy hour with her new coworkers and always “coincidentally” needs her at home whenever she wants to go out with new friends. It seems like he is maybe trying to make her unhappy socially here so she’ll be willing to move back home.

	"body" : "My sister (40f) and I (34m) recently lost our last remaining parent. We are both devastated, but regardless, the logistics all need to be worked out. Our parents were very clear in their will that our inheritance and all property are split evenly between the two of us. It’s to the tune of around $1 million.Here’s where the problems start. I’m gay, I live with my partner who I’m not married to across the country from the rest of my family. My sister and her husband have 3 small kids under 11. My sister said that since it’s highly unlikely I’ll ever have kids (which still remains to be seen, I haven’t decided that yet) and because I live a comfortable life currently, that I should take at least a quarter of my inheritance money and open bank accounts for her kids.Instead of using her own money to do that, she wants to buy a McMansion to get out of their smaller cramped house. Basically implying that her and her family need the money more than I do since they’re married with kids and I’m not. She thinks my parents were unfair when they created the will and that I should “do the right thing” to make up for their mistake.Our entire family is split on the issue. My BIL is obviously on my sister’s side and says I’m being greedy and don’t care about my niblings’ future. Our aunts and uncles and cousins all have differing opinions, with the more homophobic side of the family saying I’m being a greedy asshole. This is causing a major rift and I’m worried that eventually she’ll cut me off and wont let me have a relationship with the kids anymore. Part of me thinks maybe they do need the money more than me. Maybe I should just let the money go. AITA?Update: I talked to my sister and told her that giving her kids a quarter of my inheritance is off the table. No ifs ands or buts about it. I told her that the most I’m willing to do is leave her children as the heirs to my estate if I don’t end up having kids of my own, but if she wants to set up accounts for them right now it’s going to have to come out of her own money. She was salty about it but begrudgingly agreed, I think showing her this thread also helped. She’s not going to cut me off from her kids, and she said I was crazy to think she would ever do that.

We get along wonderfully, that is - except one weird thing.For context, I am taller, and have always been naturally slim, while she is short, was naturally thick and gradually became obese during our twenties.Coming back to the weird thing: she has a habit of forcing food on me when SHE is hungry or wants a snack. For example, when we hang out, she will keep filling my plate even though I tell her that I am full. She will keep opening snacks and than telling me to 'take some' repeatedly. She will fill me a glass of soda when I clearly say I don't want it. But - SHE wants more food, snacks or drinks, so she will take some for her and 'force' some on me as well.  In the past 25 years of friendship I have said nothing of this, and I generally manage to go around it. I don't know why she does this, but I have always thought she feels better if she is not eating alone. Strange habit.Fast forward this weekend, we hung out at her house for a few hours (just the two of us). The whole time she was commenting how 'I am drinking slowly' (one glass of wine in the time period she drank three) and 'not eating anything' (there was only potato chips and similar snacks). In the end, she took out large ice-creams, and while I said I didn't want ice-cream, she opened both and passed one to me. I then said 'girl you don't seem to understand that I physically cannot eat as much as you, thank you but I am really full from my lunch, the glass of wine is enough for me'. She got mad, she said I insulted her, and that she is offering out of politeness.She is still passive aggressive towards me. Both her husband and mine think I was harsh on her, and 'throwing my thin body' in her face. That was not my intention at all, and I would never intentionally hurt her. I apologized for hurting her feelings.AITA? How could I have communicated this better?ETA:Thank you all for your replies and insights! I appreciate your kind advices, suggestions, and different points of view.We are from the Balkans. Yes - feeding is very much treated as a love language here. Also, we usually don't 'therapy-speak' - some of the suggested alternatives for my comment would never come naturally or comfortably.Many seem to assume this is a core issue or main point in our friendship. We have been through so much together, we have a great relation that can't be described in a post. We have never had a direct dedicated conversation about this habit of hers because I have always managed to go around it (example: change the topic with some joke) and I don't want to start a conversation she clearly doesn't want to have (she never speaks about her eating habits, weight gain, or potential insecurities).

Our parents said it was because he's younger and would eventually, but to this day I have never received a gift from him personally. Now that we're adults, I call and text him occasionally to check in, and though he's nice when he responds, he doesn't initiate. I figured that was just how he is. I always put more work in, but he's my brother and I love him.I'm graduating from graduate school soon, and I invited my whole family out to celebrate. Everyone got a plane ticket and hotel room I'm paying for and it's been planned out for months.

I asked if it really had to be that day, if he couldn't postpone it for a week or something, but he said no dice and to cancel his reservations. I said okay and hung up. I decided I was done being in a one-way relationship with him, even though I always thought of him as my best friend.Later, I was talking to our mom and she was saying how excited she is to see us, and I told her, \"Oh, brother's not coming. He chose a dog over me.\" She asked what I was talking about, and I explained. She said she was disappointed but not surprised. Word got out and my brother called me, really hushed and sad and said what I said wasn't cool. I said I just told the truth. He called me an AH and we haven't spoken since. I said what I said in anger and bitterness, but now I'm feeling really guilty because I've always forgiven my brother and I've never heard him sound the way he did on the phone.

My brother has a social life outside of me which I was not invited to, nor forced myself into. I did not insert myself into his friend groups, just that when there were group functions I would hover near them as opposed to being in a corner. When we were alone we acted very friendly with each other and we would hang out regularly, like playing video games together.

I knew about it well in advance and was fine with it. I figured it was a one-every-few-years sort of thing.A month or so after that trip, he tells me they’re planning another overseas trip for this Spring.  This time, it’s a place I’ve always wanted to go; we had previously started to plan a trip there ourselves, but decided it would have to wait until the kids were older. I told him I wasn’t happy but somewhat grudgingly gave my blessing to what was supposed to be a 7-10 day trip.   Same goes for another 5-7 day trip abroad they decided to plan for this Summer, again to a place we had previously talked about going together when kids are older.And then I found out that first the Spring trip and then the Summer trip had ballooned into 3 weeks each.  I got upset. I cried and told him I felt betrayed and abandoned, like he was leaving me here to raise the kids (both trips will now cause him to miss significant kid-related events he knew about before planning) while he just goes on doing what he wants and living his life without me.  He found my response really hurtful, that I would act like he’s abandoning me and the kids, and said that he deserves to have meaningful friendships and see beautiful things.Am I being unreasonable about this? I feel like I might be, because I haven’t done a good job balancing parenthood and my own social life (I basically don’t have one anymore) and worry I might be speaking from a place of envy than fairness.  And we do also take other trips together as a family.  But two months of international travel in the span of a year seems like a lot.  And when you also add on the bi-monthly hanging out, that’s about 4 months out of town with his friend. (I can count on one hand the number of solo days out I’ve had in the last 3 years with any of my friends, and so again I’m not sure how much this is envy vs unfairness?)Note: I haven’t yet insisted he cancel any of his trips, but want to ask he at least scale the summer trip back to 1 week instead of 3. So bonus: WIBTA if I insisted he scale back the summer trip to 1 week?",

One of them is our bio-parents and one of them is between my bio mom's brother(55) and my bio dad's sister(54). My bio mom Linda and bio dad Chris actually have met in my uncle's and aunt's engagement dinner when both of them were 16.Linda and Chris are still complete wrecks. My bio dad was the troubled one of the family whom would have problems with school or the work and my bio-mom has addiction issues since she is 14.When they have met and started to have a relationship ,both sides of the family tried to break them up,they even sent them to different countries but they stole 50k USD from their families,managed to come together and ran away when they were 19. They got married in a 3rd world country and they had me(25M) and my twin brother when they were 21 years old. They thought we were deadweights so they left us in the hospital and went into another country. Luckily they have checked into the hospital with their passports so the hospital have reached into the embassy ,than they found my grandparents and they brought us back home and we have been raised by our uncle and aunt since(we call them mom and dad). My parents were charged with child abandonment but after 10 years of being MIA,the charges were dropped and our families also didn't try to look for them.2 years ago,they showed up at my dad's parents house in a completely renovated look. Turns out they have finished their education,had stable jobs in the country,started to get mental health treatments and they were sober for 9 years and they have basically put themselves together.At first 6 months,they have only seen their parents in public places,than they were accepted into the houses. A year later,they have met with us when we were 24. Me and my twin brother started to have a relationship with them and we are somewhat cordial right now.Last week,our abandonment topic was opened and  Linda told it was the hardest choice they have made. I started to laugh uncontrollably after that and when they asked told them they had multiple choices to come back and they didn't and our families were right not to trust them and they would always have the eyes on them and they should accept this at this stage. Linda started to cry and they left shortly. All of the family except my brother think I am being too cruel and I should apologize but I think they had to hear the unfiltered truth. AITA?",

On Thursday (yesterday), she brought in a homemade stir fry and used our shared microwave in the break room to do it. I was in the room when she took it out of the microwave, and it smelled heavenly. I asked her about the recipe and she told me it was just a bunch of ingredients and spices thrown together as to not waste any veggies that might go bad soon.When I was telling her how good it smelled, I also mentioned that some other people at the office might think it would be too smelly or ethnic (as in, racist people tend to look down on \"ethnic\" things). I have read those kind of stories on here about microagressions when it comes to people of color and the food they bring in, and I wanted to warn her that she might not want to bring it in anymore so it doesn't happen to her. I emphasized that it smelled good to me personally, though.I guess a couple of the other co-workers in the room overheard our conversation, because after Anna left the room, some of them sort of quietly told me how it was inappropriate for me to have said that. I told them that it's true, that ethnic food gets ridiculed for smelling too strong and that I disagreed with that senitment, but I also think she would face less harassment if she didn't bring in that food anymore. One of my other coworkers then said that \"I was the only one harassing her\" and making insinuations that her food is problematic, plus the fact that she hasn't even been bringing in her own food that often since she just started last week, so there couldn't have been an opportunity to have had this hypothetical harassment happen to her. I just wanted people, yes, even the assholes, at the office to make her feel welcomed.I left work that day not thinking anything of it, until the following morning where I hear from a different coworker that Anna talked to our HR department about the conversation and how she was \"hurt\". I'm a bit frustrated as to why she didn't talk to me about it first since it was just a misunderstanding and that I'm looking out for her. I did notice that today she was trying to dodge me, which is unusual and a bit heartbreaking. I just want to work things out. I wanted to be a friend to her and help her out since this is one of her first jobs out of undergrad, but this has been blown of out proportion. Now my coworkers think I'm racist, but I really try my best to be an ally, but then again what do I know?So, am I the asshole for telling her that her food might be a bit too much for other potentitally racist people in the office to handle?EDIT: Some people have said to edit this post to add this: yes, I get it, I'm the asshole. What I said was really stupid. If it means anything to you guys, I remember entering the workforce as a young man shadowing assholes and I didn't know how to express how shitty I was treated since I thought it was normal to be treated a certain way or overhear certain things. I just thought she was a sweet girl who didn't deserve to see the nasty side of corporate life so quick, but I guess I ended up being like the guys that made my earlier career so god awful.Anyway I want to apologize to her in the most HR-friendly way this Tuesday. Hopefully she doesn't quit, but I also don't want to be the one that gets fired. Fingers crossed. Thank you for opening my eyes and I hope to do my due diligence to be a real ally.",

	"body" : "Hi reddit.I (20f) had my friend (21f), let's call her Alice, over at my place the other day, we had just come home from a bar for a lil’ nightcap since everything had closed by that point. When we got to my apartment I quickly went to the bathroom and told Alice to make herself at home. Suddenly, maybe 10 min later, she started acting really weird. Like, she was slurring her words in an excessive way and seemed to be completely spaced out. I was incredibly confused because she had barely drank when we were out, and now she was out of it.My first thought was that she could have been drugged at the bar we just were at. Whilst trying to figure out WTF I'm supposed to do - she asked me what flavor my vape was, which confused me because I do not vape, nor do I smoke. I asked her what she meant, and she pointed at a vape on my bookshelf. That's when everything clicked.For my 20th birthday a friend (20m) had bought me a THC vape. My gift would be tickets to watch the new Spider-Man movie high. I am not a stoner, but I maybe once or twice a year smoke with friends just for fun. Anyway, I hadn’t smoked it since then, so it was just lying on the top of my bookshelf. I am short, so I never see it - hence me suppressing its existence. Alice, however, is very tall. She must have been looking around whilst I was in the bathroom, seen the vape (which looks very unassuming, like any vape) and taken some puffs. Mind you, I do not know what the fuck type of vape this is because I remember taking max two puffs and I had a complete out-of-body experience, and I don't even know how many puffs she took - she is an avid vaper.I asked her if she had smoked that vape, and she said yes. Now, Alice is extremely anti drugs. Her father was a heroin addict, so she never did anything except drink alcohol. I always had a total understanding and full respect to her disposition to drugs - so i NEVER, EVER did drugs in front of her (I have only ever smoked weed & did the occasional molly festivals, as you do lol)She completely (understandably) freaked out and started crying. I tried calming her as much as I could, I tried giving her food and water or ANYTHING to sober her up, but she screamed at me that I had drugged her. She said she couldn't believe I had done this to her etc. I had to call her boyfriend and explain the situation, and he picked her up.I feel fucking awful. My stomach drops even thinking about it. If I had remembered the vape of course I would have stashed it away more safely! But, I hadn’t planned on her coming over until we went to my place and by the point we were home I was tipsy, and the thought didn't even cross my mind, just as it hadn’t since I had put it on the shelf! As soon as she left I sent a huge apology text to her, but she left me to read. I get it.She has since blocked me everywhere and shunned me to all our mutual friends, who are all torn on the issue. I have barely slept since, I can't eat, I feel so bad.AITA?",

My wife had already helped move in the day before, and we had to help finish up the process.  Upon arrival, we moved the boxes into her apartment.  After we took all of her things in, I figured we were done.  My wife informed me that she was going to help our daughter unpack and get settled in.  I asked how long it would take, and she told me about an hour.I waited in the living room as my wife and daughter unpacked.  After an hour, I went in to see how much longer they would be, and my wife was busy helping our daughter decorate.  I politely said that our daughter didn't need help with decorating, and that she had plenty of time to decorate the next day before classes started.  My wife told me that she was going to help, and that since we didn't have any other plans, time shouldn't matter.My wife does a lot for our kids, and I think that because they are young adults, they can do things for themselves.

But now that she's older she is more decided on going there. Sam keeps saying no, he's worried she might become distant from him living so far away, and that she might fall into bad company.I disagree I think at 16 she's more than responsible enough, and it will only be for two years. He still kept saying no and Laura was pressuring me to convince him. I kept being stuck between them.The deadline kept coming nearer and Laura kept crying to me about it begging me so I decided to go ahead and apply (she needed me to pay the application fee) even though Sam was against it (he knew I was applying). She got in and I went ahead and paid the tuition. Sam is now very mad at me, he says I had no right and the mood around our house is intense. Kate's parents agree with me as do my in-laws but my SIL says I had no right. AITA? I don't know what to do.  How do I convince him?Edit: I am Lauras' legal guardian so I can legally send her. Even though Laura doesn't call me mom. she and I have a very close relationship. The reason we are close is partly because I always respected Kate and her memory and never tried to take over. Kate is mom and will always be, but I'm important to Laura too. Please stop undermining my role in her life just because we're not related by blood.One reason I applied is that if I didn't she would never get to apply again. The school doesn't accept students for older grades. So it was now or never. Sam still has till August to change his mind but if he doesn't Laura knows she has to stay.The other reason is that if I didn't it would damage our relationship with Laura. She has wanted this since she could remember, she grew up watching videos Kate took when she was there. It's her dream to go where her mom went, to be close to her. It's where Kate spent the best years of her life, and the last years of her life as she died only 4 months after moving to our current country and giving birth.If this ends up breaking Sam and me up...it's a cost I'm willing to take as long as Laura gets to live her dream.Edit 2: She hasn't gone yet, she doesn't go till Sept. I just applied because it was the last call for applications.Edit 3: Judgment is I'm the AH and fine. I accept it. I still would have done the same. This school was a massive part of Kate's life and identity. Kate spent 7 years of school there, went to a university close by, and worked at the school part-time. Then worked there full time till she had to move to our country to give birth to Laura and after 4 months she died.Kate's death traumatized Sam and despite my insistence, he hasn't gone to therapy for it. Sam's reasons for not letting Laura go have all to do with his paranoia toward losing her like he lost Kate. I believe I have done the best decision for Laura and these comments have only reinforced that.Most of the AH votes have more to do with hatred of step-parents and slut shaming me for our age difference than what was best for Laura.Edit 4: Logging off now. I will talk to Sam about him getting therapy. His paranoia has been an issue with him and Laura before. He even wanted to get the 360 app one time but I said no. I have to do what's best for her. If I have to pick between her happiness and him I will pick her every time.",

They are both great kids that are successful, accomplished and I couldn't be more proud, but lead very different lives.  We all still live in the same area, the area I raised them at.  One (F25) travels extensively for work and has an on again off again boyfriend and the other (F28) is married and has a 3 month old son.My daughter with the 3 month old works full time and is going back to work as her maternity leave is ending.  I work part time but offered to watch my grandson at my house while they are at work.  I'd quit my job, which I'm okay doing. We recently had a sit down about watching him and my daughter and husband gave me a list of rules, one they stressed was no animals around the baby.  That one was a bit of a surprise and conflicts with the needs of my other daughter. I asked why, they cited safety.  I accepted them, because I want to watch my grandson and be involved in his life.My other daughter that travels for work has a pair of dogs. When she is out of town, she drops the dogs off with me.  The dogs can be a bit rambunctious but otherwise behaved.  She is usually gone 3 days at a time, usually midweek.  So the time that I watch the dogs would conflict with my grandson.  I've been watching her dogs for 3 years.  I've informed her that I want to watch my Grandson and because of that I can't watch the dogs as much anymore.  Well she did not take that news well and flipped out.  Says it isn't fair that she now has to find other means to take care of the dogs and it is financially affecting her. I told her I can stop by and check on them in the evenings, but I won't have the time to properly take care of her dogs if they were left at her place. She hasn't spoken to me or her sister in the past week.    So was i the asshole here?",

Ever since I was a teenage my siblings have always asked me for favors, mostly to babysit. I did it for a while when I was around 16, but quickly realized they didn’t appreciate anything and there was nothing in it for me so I stopped. For the past 6 years I’ve had the “don’t ask me for anything” stance, since my siblings are the type to ask for favors but never offer to help you need it. They always borrow money from our parents but never pay it back.My oldest brother is getting evicted, and asked if him and his girlfriend and their four kids could stay with me and my husband. My husband and I own a 4 bed 2 bath home. I told them no because they have a habit of settling in somewhere and not paying rent and refusing to leave. They also let their four kids absolutely destroy every rental they live in, coloring on the walls, holes in the walls, etc.My brother and his girlfriend are pissed at me, and they blew up at us at my mothers birthday party last week. They’re going to have to stay at a shelter and they’re saying it’s my fault, but I think it’s their own lack of responsibility. My other two siblings chimed in agreeing with my brother, and they think I’m a sucky asshole. I think that my siblings suck and I don’t want my house getting torn up by their heathens. I know that if I let them move in I’d end up having the evict them, and they wouldn’t pay for anything at all.I think it’s not fair that they always ask me for money because I make more money than they do, and they treat my husband and I like we’re some kind of upper class snobs because we worked hard and made good choices in life to be able to buy a house early.AITA for not helping my siblings?

As Emma’s only living paternal relative, I have set aside money to take care of her. This is mostly in the form of paying for Emma’s violin and language lessons, something Leo started.

	"body" : "(Throwaway for obvious reasons)My ex-wife Kate and I have two kids (Mike, 16 and Abby, 14). We had a turbulent marriage and split for many reasons. It wasn’t amicable and I had to fight for custody.Kate and I both remarried. She didn’t have children with her new husband. I have three (9F, 7F, 5M) kids with my wife and also gained a stepdaughter (19). My stepdaughter’s father left after he found out my wife was pregnant, so she never knew her father. When I came into their lives I took on the role of a father figure. As far as blended families go, I am really lucky that we are all happy. My stepdaughter and I have good relationship and Mike and Abby love their siblings from my wife.The only person that is against my family is my Kate. My wife is black and this has been a point of contention since the beginning. Especially the fact that my wife is a very dark-skinned black woman is problematic to her. Kate, her husband and I are very white. Kate hates my wife and, especially, my stepdaughter (her bio-dad is also black). Kate’s racism was one of many factors of our divorce. She has been mostly silent on my biracial kids even though they present as black. Thankfully Mike and Abby haven’t taken over her racism.Because of this, Kate has been on a crusade, trying to make my families life as difficult as possible. It came to a head last week. We were planning to go on a vacation abroad with the entire family. Including Mike and Abby. Everyone was looking forward to it. Especially, my stepdaughter was looking forward to it. But Kate wouldn’t sign the documents that would allow Mike and Abby to travel abroad (because they are minors). Everyone was really disappointed. It would be the first vacation abroad for my three bio-kids with my wife.I then decided to go and book the vacation anyway but without Mike and Abby. Understandably, they were not happy. Normal I don’t badmouth Kate in front of them, but I told them its because of her that they can’t go.This caused Kate to become really angry, saying I was prioritising my new family, and abandoning Mike and Abby. She somehow placed the blame for all this on my stepdaughter. Saying my stepdaughter was taking their father away. Also calling me a “race traitor”, which didn’t make sense.This unleashed a shitstorm with everyone of our friends weighing in, with some saying I am an asshole. Mike and Abby are pissed at me for not going on vacation, and place the blame on me, after I deflected blame away from my stepdaughter.Kate calls me an asshole for going on vacation. I am beginning to think booking the vacation was a mistake, AITA?Edit: I talked with my wife about the situation after reading through many replies posted here. My wife doesn’t want to cancel or rebook the vacation because she doesn’t want to give Kate more power over our family. I agree.I sat down with Mike and Abby and, again, explained the situation. They are really angry with their mother and apologised to my stepdaughter for initially blaming her. They really aren’t happy with us going on this vacation without them.I told them we could take a separate trip with only them domestically. They liked that idea. Another option was that I could still figure out to make them go with us, if Kate would still sign the documents. Maybe they could convince her. I told them to be careful to not overly antagonise her though. Kate can be nasty to them too and I don’t want them punished when they are at their mother’s.We are planning to go international next year too, and I learned my lesson.

Leslie does not have a working vehicle at the moment and is working two jobs so Emily took it upon herself to help Leslie out as much as she can. Emily had started asking me to help as well in driving Leslie and her kids around, taking them to school/appointments, taking Leslie to the grocery store, etc, whenever Emily or someone else couldn't.I agreed since it made my wife happy and I understand the kind of situation Leslie is in. Helping has turned into Emily inviting Leslie and her kids over often, or organizing trips that they would like, such as camping or fishing. A few times my wife was unable to attend these get-togethers she organized due to work and insisted they still take place leaving me to entertain Leslie and her kids on my own. Since I've known of Leslie my entire relationship with my wife I didn't think too much about this. The times that it has been me left with her, or sent in Emily's stead to shuttle Leslie around, I've made normal small talk with her and her kids.Recently, Leslie's kids were going to be away for a weekend so Emily wanted to have Leslie over for dinner and some movies. She asked me to text Leslie to ask her over and when I did, Leslie replied with \"Just as friends right? I'm not interested in being anyone's girlfriend\". I thought that response was out of left field so I asked her why she'd even say that and her response was pretty much \"No guy would be asking me and my kids how we're doing or helping me out unless he wanted something in return\". I told Leslie it wasn’t anything like that and then showed my wife the conversation and informed her I would be stepping back from helping her with anything involving Leslie and to leave me out of any future plans. I also offered to show her the rest of my phone and anything else. Emily believed me but she still talked to Leslie about it to see what had given her that impression and accordingly, she gave Emily the same answer. A few days later Leslie apologized to Emily and told her that her emotions and mind were just all over because of a down day. That’s fine but I’m still not willing to help her or my wife out anymore as I had been because I don’t want any repeats or accusations hurled at me when I was helping as my wife asked. Emily thinks I’m overreacting and should just brush it off because it was just a ‘silly miscommunication’ she had on a bad day. AITA?Additional info: The text I sent Leslie about the night was \"Emily wants to know if you'd like to come over for dinner and some movies on Saturday\". That's why her response was so out of left field. I sent the text because Emily was busy on her phone and wanted to know asap so we could make our weekend plans.Edit: Thanks for all the comments and different perspectives. I'll talk to Emily tonight when we get home about the overhelping and what to do going forward. We are not swingers, Leslie knows my wife is completely monogamous, and while I will be bringing up concerns she's helping too much, this level of help between the two of them has been present for as long as I've known my wife.",

I picked this one because it has a circuit area, and I’ve only ever done circuit workouts before, so while I’m learning the ropes, I wanted something familiar.The circuit area is different from the rest of the gym. The workout is 1 minute per machine and the area is designated for people doing that workout. There are signs posted clearly, there is a timer on a screen on the wall. The rules are there for all to see. Limit: 1 minute per machine.The machines aren’t different from the ones in the rest of the gym, so many of the gym goers use the circuit machines when the matching one is occupied. When no one is using the circuit area, this doesn’t matter and no one tells them not to. But when someone is, they are expected to move off a machine that someone needs to complete their workout. I’ve had to ask people to move a few times, for some I even had to point out the rules, and people typically move without incident.Until the other day… I was doing my workout and a man was using a machine in the middle of the circuit area. I skipped over the machine he was on, hoping he would be done by the time I was done with the other 5-6 machines I would be using. When I was done, he wasn’t, and after glancing over to see if the matching machine was free (it wasn’t) I asked him if he could move for just one minute so I could finish up. He said no. I tried to explain that the area he was in wasn’t for regular workouts, and that I just needed that one machine to complete my workout. He said no again. I pointed out the rule sign and timer, and he started yelling at me, saying he’d been a member however many years and no newbie was going to come in and tell him what he can and can’t use, and called me some names I won’t repeat.I got a staff member who told him he had to move, and eventually he did, and I used the machine for exactly one minute. I was quite shaken at being screamed at by a grown man in a public place though.I went home and emailed the gym owner complaining about the man.

I did not tell her I was getting the cat, I had an incredible two weeks with the cat. Before she came back, I gave the cat to a friend to watch over so there wouldn’t be extra dander in the apartment. Mind you I kept my roommates door closed so the cat would not go in. She comes back and if you’ve ever had a cat, you know there’s always a slight smell and slight dander. She immediately starts asking questions as her eyes get puffy.

When she was graduating high school she was upset about not having anything to wear or so it appeared and she asked if she could borrow a bracelet mom left me. I was like sure, just give it back after. But my sister gave it to Jane after and it took months for me to get it back. I told Jane I would escalate the situation if I didn't. Everyone, meaning dad, my sister, Jane and Norah, thought I was shitty for that.Now the necklace has become an issue. It was mom's favored piece of jewelry and I have always worn it. I wore it on my wedding day. My sister is aware that it was mom's favorite and she has seen photos of her wearing it. She wanted to borrow it to wear on her wedding day. I was like no fucking way. I told her I had made it clear after the graduation incident that she was never borrowing another piece off me again and I told her that if she wants something of mom's to wear, she should take back the stuff she gave away.My sister lost it with me and started yelling that I have always held it against her that she didn't hold mom on a pedestal and reject everyone who came into our lives after. She said I had no right to throw that stuff in her face (I didn't) and that she showed be allowed to wear something of mom's to her wedding just like I did when I got married. She broke down and told me I was selfish and awful and I took pleasure in doing this to her and I sucked and had ruined her wedding.AITA?",

She got on mum’s arse for ‘enabling an entitled brat’.Another example was when my mum supported Mark’s decision to get the tattoo he had been saving up for, for years. Jane proceeded to call mum up to complain that he made the deposit (with his hard earned, saved money) and had an appointment set. She told mum that was wasn’t going to allow this ‘emotional incest’ anymore and that she’s happy to make an appointment for all of us for family therapy as this ‘enmeshment’ is making her uncomfortable.She has continued to make comments like these, specifically to mum and it’s disgusting how little respect she has for pretty much everyone but herself. She’s not been invited to Christmas this year but Mark is. It’s unclear what they’re planning to do yet.A few days ago, Jane called me as mum had blocked her. She said she was 3 months pregnant and went on a long rant about the family dynamic. She then asked ‘why don’t you all like me?’ I laughed out of pure shock and asked if she was serious. She didn't even respond, just said 'I'll call you when you're in the mood to be more mature.' and hung up.I told mum about the situation and she's on my side but Mark is fuming at me for laughing at Jane's question and angry at mum for being on my side. Mum just told him that he needs to talk to Jane about her constant comments and insults and she's expecting an apology.Mark won't talk to me and Jane blocked my number.AITA?EDIT: The tattoo has got nothing to do with our mum.

However, when she pulled it out and saw the chain attached, she accused me of trying to prank her, and wouldn't hear a word in edgewise. She was yelling at me and crying, and I felt horrible.

	"title" : "AITA for enforcing a no-kids-talk rule and not offering to plan a baby shower?",
	"body" : "really are ~we~ the assholesOur friend group (F, 30s) gets together about once a month. A few years ago, certain group members began trying to conceive. One of the first ones to start trying was “Katie.” Unfortunately, Katie and her husband had difficulty conceiving. This was understandably very difficult for them. Once other members of the group started having kids Katie asked us to not talk about kids at our monthly get-togethers because it was difficult for her to hear. She also made it clear that she would not attend any baby showers. The rest of our group had mixed feelings about this. We understood that Katie was very upset about her difficulties conceiving but it was disappointing to not be able to share important parts of our lives. We generally go around and everyone talks about what’s new in their lives (work, promotions, hobbies, etc.) but whenever one of us was on maternity leave we could basically only say “everything is good” because we couldn’t talk about the main thing happening in our life. That said, now that our kids are older and we are all back to work/have time for hobbies we have started to enjoy having a dedicated time for “no kids talk.” It is something that we have even come to look forward to.Fast forward to now and  Katie and her husband are pregnant, which is very exciting. She is nearing her due date and planning to take at least a year off to stay home with the baby.That’s enough background so now to the point.. Last night me and two other members of our group got a text from Katie’s husband saying that she is really upset that we barely ask her about her pregnancy when we see her and that no one has offered to throw her a baby shower. At first we were surprised to hear this. We do text Katie at least weekly to check in on her, we just don’t talk about it at our monthly hang-outs (she has been talking about it in her updates but no one has asked any follow-up Qs about the pregnancy and we more focus on her other updates). We talked to the rest of the group (except for Katie) and the general vibe is that we want to keep the no-kid-talk rule in place and it feels a little rude that Katie expects us to when she is the one who made the rule in the first placeWould we be the asshole if we keep our traditions? We also don’t feel like we have time to plan a shower with the holidays happening. It sounds like no one wants to go through the stress of planning a shower when Katie didn’t even go to theirs.tldr: Are we the assholes for sticking to our tradition even though the original reason no longer applies?Update/additional information:I just want to address some common comments..We were all still pretty young when Katie first started trying/experiencing fertility issues. For most if not all of us she was the first person we knew to share that she was experiencing that. When she asked we not talk about babies/kids at the monthly get together we agreed because we didn’t know if that was a reasonable ask or not and really just wanted to be supportive of our friend. I understand many of you would not have agreed to that and if it happened again, idk, maybe we wouldn’t but at the time we went along with it.I know Katie distancing herself from such a big part of our lives over the past few years has been a source of hurt for most of us BUT aside from this issue she is a lovely person. No one has any plans of excluding her from our friend group. We’ve just always understood it as a coping mechanism for her and no one in the group thinks that’s worth ending a friendship over.I am fairly confident that no one is acting out of retaliation or in a “tit-for-tat” manner. Since Katie asked for the no-kid-talk rule we have always still talked about our pregnancies/parenthood, we just did it when Katie wasn’t around. Although we can only coordinate the big no-kid-talk group get together about once a month, friends who live closer to each other or work together or who have kids the same age often meet up at other times and we would normally talk about kid stuff then if Katie wasn’t in attendance. Once Katie got pregnant we started being able to talk kid stuff when she was around and have definitely talked about her pregnancy in those settings, just not at the monthly get-together. This wasn’t done in retaliation, it’s just how it’s always been so we didn’t really think to do anything different.The reason most of us want to keep the No-kid-talk rule in place is because as our kids have gotten older we’ve come to appreciate having a time to take a break from being moms-first and just enjoy our friendship and the other aspects of who we are as people. We are often in work-mode or mom-mode so having this dedicated space has been really nice. I understand that Katie is not where we are today but rather where we were back then when we really wanted to gush about babies and kid stuff so I sympathize with that but I also think it’s a bit unfair to expect us all to accommodate her again. We are more than happy to text about her pregnancy or talk about it on other occasions. The rest of us just want to have this one get-together remain kid-talk-free. To be fair I she does live the farthest from the rest of us so she usually only sees people in the group about one other time a month but we are still available by text.",

I am sure if I was planning to bake something and bought yeast, I would come home to find him completely distended and surrounded in empty yeast packets. I usually stick to the same grocery list every week, and I feel like if I buy something out of the ordinary that is clearly an ingredient for a larger meal, he could at least ask before devouring it. Last night, I bought two baguettes, which I have only every purchased to make French bread pizza for him and our kids. I bought these at 11pm, and they were not even here twelve hours when I saw them on the counter, with the first six inches ripped off of each loaf, scanned the house, and saw my husband chewing. If it had been one loaf, okay. If he had used a knife, maybe. But the fact that he didn’t ask if they were going to be for dinner and then ripped the top off of both of them like that final boss bloater in The Last of Us that lumbers out of the hole and rips the guy’s head off, this is unforgivable. He insists I should tell him when I buy things if they are for a specific purpose. I say I am already taking on the burden of grocery shopping and cooking and the least he can do is ask. Am I the asshole here?Edit: Some pertinent information:We have two snack cabinets that he is free to snack from, not to mention whatever’s in the fridge.The bread was in a cabinet that is mostly ingredients.There was regular sandwich bread for the taking that was unharmed.For those who have stated that this is raccoon-like behavior, it really does feel like I am running a wildlife rehab operation, but the only patient is a 37 year-old software programmer.To the dude who said that my husband is going to “leave me for another woman who will give him peace,” tell me you’re still bitter about how things ended with Sheila without telling me you’re still bitter about how things ended with Sheila.Update: Wow, I was not expecting this to blow up, or for so many people to have such strong feelings about bread. Thank you for all of your input, especially my sister who unexpectedly chimed in. This may be the most validating experience of 7 years of living together. I shared this with my husband, and he accepts his AH status and apologized. We are going to work on communicating better, and he is going to work on his weaponized incompetence. He wants you to know he occasionally cooks rice and beans, and lately has been making us late-night quesadillas when the kids are asleep. But most of all: “I was just hungry.” -my husband",

He spent my entire childhood controlling everything I did, watched, and even ate. At Christmas he pissed me off. I was quite proud of myself for buying my first vehicle all on my own. He called my truck a POS. Then said to our parents, “Insurance companies statistically have higher rates for female drivers than males.” He was absolutely insinuating they shouldn’t put me on their policy. Simply because he’s been on their policy since he turned 16 and has never paid for insurance. He knew damn well he was getting bumped off when I was added.First of the year, our mom told him to get his own policy. He was pretty salty about that. Fast forward to this past weekend, it was our dad’s birthday. Honestly, I didn’t even want to go and sit through my brother’s usual bullshit about how great he is. But I went, and as usual pretty much remained quiet. My brother asks, so when are you moving out? I was like excuse me? He says, “You’re 18 now, you need to get out on your own now.” Literally no one said anything, so I told him it’s none of his business. He says, “Well I moved out at 19.”Here’s where things spiraled. I said to him, “Your’e not even on your own yet since you haven’t bothered paying a single penny of rent in 7 years.” He was fuming and tried changing the topic. My mom made a comment about that soon changing. Brother’s girlfriend was like what? So I told her, he moved out at 19 and hasn’t paid our parents a penny of rent all these years. She was livid, unbeknownst to anyone at that table, she had been paying my brother rent for two years because he led her to believe he was paying rent.The topic went off somewhere else. Then right back to me. My brother trying to give me fatherly advice by saying I should focus on my current job and forget wasting time with college. This was absolutely unsolicited advice. It pisses me off when he does this because he always does it, and acts like because of our age gap he has SO much more knowledge than stupid ass me. He again comments about me moving out, says to our dad…”I can’t believe you haven’t kicked her out after she brought all those animals in your house.” They both laugh. I had enough, I got up from the table and yelled JUST LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE.My mom understood, but she doesn’t want the family to fight. My dad said I was extremely rude by lashing out, caused a scene, made undue stress and embarrassed everyone. Apparently after I walked out, my brother says…”Well she obviously has something wrong in her head.” I felt bad because I’m sure a few kids dining with their families heard me, and I shouldn’t have cussed in front of them.

So yeah, apparently J is a bigger asshole then I thought but my brother is keeping an eye him and C (and before anyone says it, my brother has no interest in C, his exact words 'I love her like a friend, but have more attraction to a wall socket then C')Oh, and also, my brother plays space wolves, and well, I know E plays space orcs(ive heard so many bad cockney accents). I don't think that's his main team, I'm not sure of much beyond that!",

	"title" : "AITA for letting my family stay at our house but refuse to let my fiancé’s family do the same?",
	"body" : "My fiancés and I live together near the ocean with many tourist attractions. My family from all over the world regularly visit and stay with us. In return, we stay with them when we visit their cities for various reasons (work, vacation, etc).Last year I had to travel to the city where her brother lives and she decided to come to visit him and his family. She asked if we could stay with them and he declined because he’s still protective of his family due to the world event. I understood at first and we stayed at a hotel but later got annoyed because they had no problem going to dinner and out with us in public. Earlier this year I had to go back to his city and again she came along to visit them. He again declined her request to stay at their house so we stayed at a hotel. I understand some people just don’t like to have overnight guests. The visit went smoothly and everyone had a good time.Last week he called to ask if he and his family could stay at our place when they come here in a couple of weeks for their vacation. I got really annoyed at this because he didn’t let us stay at his house but wants to stay at ours. I told my fiancé they can stay at a hotel but she argued that they would need 3 rooms for 7 days due to their family size. She then pointed out we always let my family stay with us at which point I countered that is because we’re always invited to stay with my family whenever we visit their cities. She argued family do things for each other without expecting anything in return. We went back and forth until bed last night.I’m sitting here having coffee while she’s sleeping and I’m unsure if I’m wrong. On one hand, I know I can be stubborn and petty. On the other hand, he doesn’t invite us to stay with him while expecting us to house him and his family.What do you think?Update to answer questions:We have a 4 bedroom house along with many air mattresses. Once we hosted 10 of her college friends when they had a get together. People slept in the living room and dining room. They also have a 4 BR house and we would have been happy to sleep in the living room. We’ve slept on an air mattress many times at my family homes.All of his kids are over 10 and his wife is bringing her sister along and she needs a BR of her own. No one in his family have any disability or condition.Our house is near many of the attractions they want to go to. Due to the popularity of the attractions they want to go to, hotels and house rentals close to those attractions are more expensive than normal. Also, our house is close to shopping and restaurants.My fiancé just told me whether they stay with us or not, she’s letting her brother borrow her car for the week so that they’ll only have to rent 1 car. That means we’ll have to carpool that week. This is even more annoying as that would add about an hour to my daily commute.My fiancé is a better person than I am. I can be very petty when I’m annoyed which is why I usually take cues from her and go with her decisions in certain situations. In this case, I’m very annoyed which is why we’re in an argument.When it was just me traveling to her brother’s city, my company was paying for a hotel room. When my fiancé decided to tag along to visit her brother, she asked him to stay so she could spend more time with her nieces and nephews.",

This past weekend he completely disregarded me and I cant get it out of my head so I have to know if I was in the wrong. For some context, I was the sober driver to our group of siblings and friends and we had been out at a bar drinking. We all had a great time and headed home. At this point I was the only sober person by a long shot. My husband suggested to go join the neighbors that was a group of middle aged women partying. We don't know them. I went out and told him that it was rude to  invite ourselves to someone else's house without their permission and to leave the idea alone. Not even ten minutes later our other brother who is single came in and told us that my husband was making him feel uncomfortable trying to get him and everyone else to go over there to join the neighbors. So I went back outside and told him to cut it out. I told him he was making our brother and now me, uncomfortable (I was inside cooking food to help everyone sober up and everyone else was outside on the deck). Once I finished, I was slightly annoyed but went outside to join everyone. The next thing I know my husband and his friend (M25) stand up and start walking toward the dock. I asked them what they were doing and he said they were hot so they decided to go jump in the lake. It is pitch black out and they had both had over 7 shots that I counted in addition to many drinks. I told him absolutely not. That is not safe. He rolled his eyes at me and turned to continue walking to the dock. At this point I was pissed. I yelled out to him that was fine. I just wont be the one to tell our kids why their dad died and went back inside to get ready for bed. He ignored me the rest of the night and when I made him come in to have a conversation with me, he kept rolling his eyes. I told him I felt like he disrespected me and owed me an apology for crossing the line. He insisted that he did nothing wrong. I tried to have a conversation to explain why his actions were inappropriate but he didn't see it and instead countered that they didn't even jump in. They just put their feet in. I ended up going to bed and we haven't talked about it since. He thinks things are back to normal but knows that I am being short with him. This was an adults only weekend and no children were present at any point. So AITA for taking things too far with what I said?**Edit since it's been asked so often: brother is not blood related and is family by choice on my husbands side. All other family mentioned are my husband's and my in laws...**Final Edit: We had a great conversation and set healthy boundaries for the future. Thank you to everyone for weighing in.

	"body" : "Throwaway because. This is very Personal. And embarrassing for my sister.This happened a while ago and I’m still getting shit for it, so I think I know your answer, but maybe some explanation will help?So around 6 months ago, my fiancé (we were together for around 7 years, but were friends before that.) left me, because she “realized” she never loved me and that I was “holding her back”.She was not interested in therapy, and I am not in the habit of begging someone to stay, so I helped her pack and dropped her off at a hotel, which is what she wanted, and where she asked to be left.About a month ago she called me crying in the middle of the night to say that she had made a mistake and wanted to come “home”.I had promptly hung up on her, because I also firmly believe in the rule “don’t let them tell you they don’t want you more than once. “Apparently my family didn’t get the memo because for a while after that my family (particularly the older women) had been pressuring me to hear her out and even going so far as to tell me her “side” of the story, and how she had a breakdown and it didn’t have anything to do with me. Blah blah blah, don’t buy it.My sister recently called me out of the blue and started talking to me about how I don’t wanna be the reason for “anything bad”, so I should call and talk to my ex. I tried to brush it off, but she kept saying things like. “Well, you don’t want it to be your fault is all I’m saying…” and shit like that.I didn’t like what she was implying so I admit I snapped, and said something not so nice.  Something kinda like: “Maybe you should worry about your own relationship, I mean, god knows it takes all of your mental fortitude to keep your pants on.”Which is bad because her first two marriages ended due to cheating on her end. After a moment, She started crying on the phone and kept saying “I can’t believe you would say that” and “That’s so cruel, you don’t know what I went through!”I replied something like, “And that’s why I usually stay out of it, you know? Try to mind my business?”Apparently that “isn’t even close” to the same thing, and since then I’ve been getting yelled at by all the women in the family, but at least the ex talk has quit.AITA?",

	"body" : "Edit: commenter pointed out I didn't link the original here it isI posted last year, trying to help my 'golden child' sister Maya, at the expense of my other sister Tia. I didn't expect so many responses or the hate I got, though I now realise how badly I fucked up. While I still think how people wrote about Maya was disgusting and unfair, how I treated Tia was cruel and ignorant. I was trying to help everyone and be practical, but I neglected to properly consider the emotional side. While unintentional I was just ignoring Tia's pain and trauma.The responses were a wake-up call and I realised I was just going to ruin everything. While it wasn't meant that way, it would just hurt Tia and ruin our relationship. I managed to convince some friends to let Maya stay with them and looked for a place. Currently, Tia still lives with me, while I found a cheap one-bedroom for Maya. It's been rough financially but I managed to get everything my sisters need, a few sacrifices don't matter compared to them. Maya needed help adjusting and learning to be independent so I did have to focus on her initially, and Tia absolutely hated me giving her any attention so it was extremely difficult at first. But it got a lot better as Maya adjusted and grew more independent and I could balance my time better. It's not perfect but we've gotten into a rhythm the best we can.Maya has grown a lot, and can mostly live by herself now, though I obviously still help. Therapy has really helped her and she's made a lot of friends at university. While she still wants Tia's forgiveness, she's accepted it's not in her control and to focus on living her life and improving herself. I'm really happy she's free of our parents' influence, she's nothing like she used to be. Though I do wish I had tried harder when she was younger, rather than giving up.Tia isn't completely happy, I don't think she'll ever forgive Maya. I've done my best to make it clear I love her, and Maya isn't my favourite but it's been hard. We get joint therapy that helps a lot, but she still wishes it was just us. Still she's finally able to understand that helping Maya isn't rejecting her. I'm so thankful and lucky Tia could forgive me, she means the world to me. I never intended to hurt her, though I clearly completely fucked up my approach. We basically just avoid the Maya situation, and have managed to get back to normal. She's such a strong woman, I'm honestly so proud of her and so ashamed of how short-sighted I was.As selfish as it is, a part of me will always wish Tia could forgive her. But I know that's impossible and selfish. I don't think Tia will ever fully accept that Maya is a part of my life. The most I'll get is Tia and Maya being in one building for my wedding, but honestly that's enough for me. They're both victims of our parents, so I'm just glad they can both be happy and free. While it's not a fairy-tale ending, everything is going well. I'm glad I posted and was able to fix my horrible mistake.",

	"body" : "I (F26) have two cousins (F33 and F28). My oldest cousin, “Jane” is married. My other cousin, “Amy,” just got married. (I am single.) Right before she got engaged last summer, our grandma gave Amy’s fiancé “John” a diamond ring to propose with.This ring is a gorgeous white gold and diamond ring that our grandpa gave her. He died when our dads were teens. My grandma has since remarried and always said that she’d pass on the ring. I won’t lie, I’ve always loved that ring and hoped it would be me but I’m also the youngest cousin so I tried to temper my expectations. Mostly I was happy for Amy and glad the ring was staying in the family and Jane agreed.Fast forward to this weekend, which was Amy’s wedding. Neither Jane nor I were in the wedding but we both went to the hotel room where Amy was getting ready. She asked if we wanted to see the rings. We were both confused, but said sure. And what she showed us was a gargantuan, tacky engagement ring and wedding band  set. I sputtered something like, “But I thought you were getting married with grandma’s ring?”Amy just smiled and said, “Yeah, it is grandma’s ring!” She explained that for her wedding gift, she asked John to “upgrade” the ring into this monstrosity since he didn’t have to pay for an engagement ring in the first place. One of the diamonds was grandma’s and then the white gold melted down to make one of her wedding bands but the rest was all new stuff.I burst into tears, I was so shocked and hurt. I told her she destroyed our grandparents’ heirloom. If she wanted a giant diamond to wear every day that’s her choice but the ring was important to our family. Amy got huffy and said she had to finish getting ready so Jane and I left. Jane was also upset but had the attitude of “it’s Amy’s ring, nothing we can do now.” I told her I didn’t think grandma would have given it to John and Amy if she knew she was going to take it apart. I found Grandma and asked her if she knew what Amy had done. Amy’s mom had told her that Amy had to have it resized and have the setting fixed but Grandma had NO IDEA that it was made into an entirely new ring. She didn’t say anything but I could tell she was upset.The wedding went on but everyone could tell that there was some awkwardness between me and Amy and Jane and Grandma is refusing to talk about the matter. Amy is saying I owe her an apology. But I don’t think I’m in the wrong for saying she destroyed a family heirloom. Plus the fact that she didn’t tell anyone what she was doing and misled Grandma says to me she knew she was wrong or at least it wouldn’t have been condoned. I feel like she saw it not as an heirloom but a way to subsidize what she really wanted.I know the mature thing to do is just get over it and accept that it was given to Amy and she made her choice but I’m finding it really hard to get over what she did.

It kind of died a bit for a while but has recently started to get popular again. I have been playing for years. My account is 18 years old and it has the stats to reflect that (pets/avatars/stamps/gallery/trophies etc.). If you don't play it may not mean alot and not to brag but I have a rather impressive account due to the fact I have been playing so long.I 34F have no kids (not childfree, just don't have any). My sister 32F and BIL 34M have a daughter 11F who has been very sickly all her life. I'll not go into exactly what is wrong with her but she's been in and out of hospitals alot in her young life and recently had to go back in again for a few weeks. :(I recently learned that she's been playing on Neopets.com for a few months to help pass the time when she's not feeling well. She's really gotten into it and from what my sister says talks about it alot. She was excited to learn I also play and we talked about it when I visited her. I looked up her account and gifted her a bunch of stuff, expensive stuff that would be hard for a newer account to get. (In-game stuff using In-game money which can be kind of hard to earn in large amounts).Anyway, long story short she asked how I can afford the stuff I sent her (it was worth millions of NP) and how I have all the stuff my account has. I explained I had been playing for 18 years, did every plot/event etc. Well, apparently she got upset at the huge difference between our two accounts and asked for more stuff. When I told her no she started crying to my sister and BIL about it. My BIL came over and asked if I could gift my account to niece for her upcoming birthday (which she has to spend in the hospital). Said it would mean to world to her. I said no. I've had this account since before she was born, before we even met my BIL. I don't want to get rid of it. I still play on it literally everyday.Well he got mad and tried guilt-tripping me. I'm an adult and she's a child and it would make her happy in a rough time in her life. I'm happy to help her learn the tricks and trades of the game but I'm not giving away my account. He tried to buy it off me but I still said no. Now he is super pissed and got my sister and parents on their side. I'm being hounded everyday for this and being called an asshole because it's all my niece will talk about and she really really wants it. I feel bad because she's just a little girl in the hospital and guilty for not giving it. I offered to send a bunch of stuff to her account again but she wants my stats so she's not treated like such a newbie who doesn't know anything by other players too.I feel guilty for this but I want to keep my account.

He stomped up to the bedroom and slammed the door.I felt pretty upset and guilty, especially when I checked my period tracker and realised I was due to start today, and I should have been more wary that I was close to starting my period.Today he's apologised for shouting, but says he still upset about the jeans. He thinks I should have been more careful knowing that I was due to start my period today. I've tried to wash the jeans but they're still stained. I feel guilty but also upset that he got so angry with me.So, am I the asshole?",

It killed me when she used to tell the entire family she got a 100 on her test in a class that we were taking together even though she knew I only got a C- or D+ and they would ask me how I did after her announcement. She was always the golden child and I (26f) was the screwup.We're both pregnant right now, both of our first kids. She's married with a great job and a house and I'm on my own in a studio right now. A couple weeks ago I got an invitation to her gender reveal barbecue/pool party. I didn't want to deal with her showing off to the entire family in front of me so I told her I won't be coming. She asked why so I told her that I didn't want to deal with her friends and our family. She insisted it would be fun so I told her that gender reveal parties are tacky and I don't want to deal with it.She, again, insisted that it would be fun and just to think of it as a barbecue with colored cookies. I snapped at her that I didn't want to go to a stupid party to watch her show off to our family just like she did when we were younger.

	"body" : "So my wife and I have two kids. One who is a bit over 2 years old and another that is 5 months old. I work Monday to Friday 9-5 from home, occasionally go in to the office. My wife is on maternity leave and taking care of the 5 month old. I take care of the baby for over night wakings and feedings.The 2 year old is in daycare. Whether I send my kid to daycare 1 day or 5 days a week for 1 hour or 8 it costs the same. My wife likes to pick up our toddler from daycare around 3:15 everyday instead of letting me go when I finish work because she doesn't want our kid to be there so much during the day. The problem is I am left watching the baby for the 45 minutes while she is gone and then for the hour that she is taking care of both of them she gets overwhelmed, stressed, very annoyed at me and our kids, it's just not great overall.Every day my wife tells me that she is exhausted, she has no time to herself she doesn't get things done that she needs to, she's overwhelmed, just wants to relax when the baby naps etc... I try to help out with the baby during the day when I can, like feeding and putting him down during my lunch break. I just try to be available throughout the day if my wife needs me.Anyways, on to the main point of this post. Last night my wife tells me she wants to keep the toddler home from daycare today. I told her that I didn't think it was a good idea. How was she going to feed and put the baby down for a nap while taking care of toddler? She already gets stressed and overwhelmed just looking after the baby. Why put herself through more stress? I told her that I could not take the day off of work and she would be alone taking care of both kids. She said she really wanted to spend time with both kids and felt like she doesn't see our toddler enough. Fine, no problem, if she wants to do this it is up to her, I reiterated that I would not be around to help.Cut to this morning, I got up at midnight and 4 am to take care of the baby. I get both kids ready and made breakfast for everyone.I start work and sure enough, 20 minutes after I started, I hear my wife trying to tell our toddler that she just needs to go in the other room to put the baby down for a nap. Of course the toddler doesn't want to leave her side, toddler starts crying. I can hear my wife getting frustrated. Wife finally leaves to put baby down and comes back. She now has to juggle going back and forth trying to settle the baby by putting the pacifier back in (we are starting some sleep training) and the toddler who wants all of her attention.Finally baby gets settled, wife is obviously stressed and tired and it is 9:45am... She comes in to my office where I am working and asks did I not hear her struggling? Why did I not come and help.AITA for telling my wife I told you so, that I said I would not be around to help and this is what you get? That she should have let me bring our toddler to daycare?",

	"body" : "My wife’s sister (SIL) is getting married on a Saturday this summer. I have a shaky relationship with SIL, as she “jokes” about me during family events. Humor is one thing, but these tend to always be negative jokes about my character. Because of this, I have always thought that she doesn’t like me. I was waiting for her to possibly ask me to play some role in the wedding, since my wife is maid of honor and our only son is ring bearer.The couple did not ask me to play a role in any way. I asked what time I had to be at the wedding and I was told noon. I work a 12 hour shift on the wedding day so I decided to just take 6 hours off so I could be there around noon but I’ll still have to be up at 0400 the next day for work. I found out from my wife that SIL and future BIL are extremely upset and have been  intentionally ignoring me since they found out. They told my wife they expected me to take the entire day off (I work 12 hours every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) because they think of me as a brother and assumed I would just want to be there for the rehearsal, dinner, morning of wedding, and wedding/reception.Them not asking me to play a role, especially with my wife and our son having roles, confirmed for me that they don’t like me, so I felt no obligation to take the morning of the wedding off of which I have no part. I work 12 hour shifts, and taking one day off really cuts into my available PTO so this played a factor in my decision as well.I’m in no way upset for not having a role and my decision was in no way retaliatory. It’s not my wedding so I don’t make the calls, so it doesn’t bother me. My wife defended me and told SIL how they have always made me feel in this conversation they had when all this came up, but neither SIL or future BIL have tried to talk to me. AITA?Edit: Our son will be with my mother the morning of the wedding and I am bringing our son to the wedding, getting him in his tux, etc. My decision did not leave my wife responsible for our son and maid of honor duties that would be horrible.Edit 2: I’m adding this because it’s coming up frequently. When I said I was “waiting” for a possible role, this was not me hoping for a role. I was simply waiting to hear a yes or no so I could schedule PTO accordingly. I do not feel entitled to a role in the wedding whatsoever and any undertones in the post are most likely just difficulty conveying the story.",

	"body" : "ThrowawayMy fiancee(29) and I(31M) just found out that we’re pregnant. My fiancée mentioned that she wanted to wait to announce it at her cousin’s wedding which will be taking place on Sunday. Her cousin and her husband has been struggling getting pregnant even with IVF or the tons of others. Recently they just got some news that their insurance has stopped funding IVF and not to mention the heartbreak of a recent miscarriage on Mothers Day. They almost understandably held off on the wedding.So when my fiancée brought it up to me, I told her it’s not at all a good idea. This just seemed so wrong, especially it being at their wedding. I asked, if she was gonna at least ask her cousin for permission and she said, no because she wanted it to be a surprise for everyone. I told her it’s not the time nor the place for that and it would take the spotlight off the couple(in her family there hasn’t been a baby in 3 years so we’d be the first in that time).Fiancée feels that’s the perfect time because it’s such a joy and it’s not like she can keep it away forever and their problems shouldn’t keep her from telling something so positive, so it's on them if they turn it negative. I told her that’s not the point, she knows what they’ve been through and she’s being selfish if she actually goes through with that. She cried and claimed I wasn’t being supportive and I shouldn’t be calling my pregnant fiancee selfish. She doesn’t want me to come with her to the wedding anymore either, feeling as if I would ‘kill the mood’. She hasn’t been talking to me eitherEdit: So about my fiancée and her cousins relationship. My fiancée always saw competition in her cousin because her cus would be better at some things than her. (Grades, Dancing, Cosmetics, etc.) since they were kids and she hates that. Last year they had an argument about it because fiancée felt her cus bragged too much, where as my fiancée also mentioned “there was one thing her cus wasn’t good at” but never said what it was. So in shorter terms the relationship is in between good and bad, but her cus wanted to invite her to the wedding, I’m guessing to rekindle that.Edit: If anyone is reading this, Update coming soon!

	"body" : "I am 48 years old, married but child free by choice. It’s something my wife and I agreed on early in our relationship. We both have pretty good jobs and are able to afford many expensive items and activities. I attribute this to our jobs obviously, but also the fact that we are child free and live in a one bedroom apartment. I own a manufacturing plant that was given to me from my father. On that property, I store 4 classic cars that I have bought/restored. I have always been a car guy. I plan to buy another car in the next year too.I have one sister who is younger than me and never made the best decisions in life. She has a boyfriend who she lives with after getting divorced twice. She’s also in her early 40s. She has 2 kids who already seem smarter than their mom. She makes an okay living but she’s the breadwinner. Her bf that she lives with spends most of his time stoned and playing Xbox. He’s always “looking for a new job”. Or blaming “the capitalist system” for him not having a job.Her daughter (10) is a very good singer. I don’t have an ear for talent but to me She is very good. My sister has wanted to enroll her in lessons with a private coach but cannot afford it. She has asked me to help her out since she is embarrassed to ask our parents. She also does not speak to the father of her daughter. I declined politely until she made a comment about my money and cars, just another “must be nice” comment I’m all too sick of hearing. Here is where I made my asshole comment.I said “Maybe if your boyfriend can put down the dope for all of 10 minutes he can help you out” and “I have 5 cars I’ll buy another 5 before I give you a dime”. I said her daughter isn’t my responsibility. She’s got a mother and a father and if they can’t figure it out it doesn’t fall on my shoulders.My sister called my wife and told her “how mean” I was to her. My wife now wants us to give the money, but I don’t want to. Sure we can afford it but I’m not my sisters welfare. Last bit, I’m sure some of you will make a comment about how I refer to her daughter or my niece. They live in another state and have for the entirety of her life. I don’t see my sister or her kids much at all. I don’t really know her kids too well. I send them birthday and Christmas gifts but I’m not close with them.Edit: this is coming up a lot in comments. My sister could have had a stake in the business but she didn’t want to work there. I’ve worked for my dad all my life and learned the business. She never did. She knew she wouldn’t be getting anything with it and she was okay with that.Edit: I have given financial support to her before and I’ve decided to pay for nieces lessons directly",

After a few drinks, this guy I didn't know came up to me at the bar which was pretty loud and crowded, and said something to me that I only half-caught, but I could tell the vibe of it was that someone had a problem with me being gay, and he'd suggest I don't go saying that I'm gay around work.I figured he was doing me a solid, I am a lesbian in a state that's not too friendly to that, and often at a new job someone will pull me aside and warn me who the bigots are at the office. I always appreciate it because honestly that whisper network has saved my ass a few times.But I didn't really hear the name he said, so I went \"Who?\" He seemed surprised like the guy was someone I should obviously know, and I was like \"Who did you say?\" And he said a name I still didn't catch. I was feeling kinda embarrassed, I honestly am sorta insecure about my hearing, so I didn't want to ask him to repeat himself a fourth time. So I was like hey man I'm sorry but I'm blanking on the name, could he point him out? I was still assuming he meant some coworker at the bar.He was going like... What the fuck, no I can't?

You're tryna tell me to look out for someone and you can't even tell me which guy you're warning me about?At that point he raised his voice at me, and yelled that it was Jesus Christ.

Sam and my ex ended up marrying seven months later. Emily has always adored Sam. I, however, hate the guy. For years he would work on getting under my skin, saying I wasn't a good enough dad to my daughter because I wasn't enough and she considered him her dad too. He'd tell me every single time she had called him Daddy Sam or Dad Sam. When I told him he was being childish he'd tell me in return that he knew it cut me up inside to have to share her affection as dad. He told me one day he would be walking her down the aisle and maybe she'd even want him to do it alone and would not want me anywhere near them for that.Despite all this Sam was never able to come between me and Emily and we have always been very close. Sam never cared for Hayes as much. I think Hayes being gay has a large part to play in Sam not caring for him as much as he does Emily.There are times I had to restrain myself from exploding in front of the kids when Sam would taunt me. I knew he'd love a chance to get me out of my kids lives.Last year Sam was diagnosed with motor neuron disease. He's now in a wheelchair and has lost his mobility and his speech has suffered greatly.Emily is getting married in a few months and wanted us both to bring her down the aisle.A week ago she came to my house and told me she wanted to pay a special tribute to Sam and she wanted my help to do it (both finance and planning). I told her I would not help her with that. She was upset. Said Hayes refused to help her as well. She told me Sam means a lot to her and she would have thought I would be glad that she had two amazing father figures. I told her Sam and I did not have a positive relationship and there is no way I would ever spend my money or time doing something nice for the man. I told her he had treated me poorly over the years and I accepted she loved him. But he was not worthy of my money or that effort in my eyes. She asked me if I would do it for her. I told her I could not. She said okay.Emily's fiance called me up after this and said whatever petty issues between Sam and I, could I not do something for my daughter when she's going to lose one of her most special people.

I also want to earn money to give my girlfriend, she deserves the world. Because I have so many side hustles going on to earn money, I admittedly don't spend a lot of time with my girlfriend, but I've always been open with her that I am not able to give her a lot of attention right now even though I love her more than anything.My girlfriend lost her job last month, and as a result has been at the house more often. We live in a one bedroom and split the rent evenly. She understands that I'm busy all day/night, but I don't like when she's sitting in the same room as me. Even her presence is distracting to me, she will try to start conversations and she's not the cleanest, so I would ask her to go to the bedroom for the day while I worked in the living room at my desktop. She was ok with that for a few weeks, but began to complain that she was stuck in the bedroom. She says that since she's paying half the rent, she has every right to be where she wants to be in the house. I agree. So, after a few big fights, we agreed she would leave the house during the day and I would leave the house at night. Well, now she's upset that she's spending all day out of the house.

The bill eventually comes up and I ask for it to be split. She says in such a grating voice “what do you mean split bill???! I thought you were paying for us?” That’s when it clicked… she only came for the free fuc**ng food. I immediately glared at my dad, who started blaming me saying “ why would you offer to pay? and then not follow through?” Maybe because I wasn’t expecting to pay for another 6 people??!?.I ended up asking the waitress how much it would be because I didn’t  want to ruin the mood and my little sister’s accomplishment.The bill came out to be about $557.87…Excluding what me and my family (My dad, my two sisters and my grandpa) ate, it would be about $243.68.I outright refused to pay for her and her kids’ meals I felt as because two of them are still kids but I never invited her myself, let alone agreed to pay for her bill.Now my dad is calling me an asshole because he had to pay for it with his credit card. I don’t believe I did anything wrong but that’s the reason I’m here.AITA?——————Edit 1: I know I will definitely sound just like any other user saying “I was not expecting this to blow up” but I truly mean it. Also, sorry for all of the grammar and spelling mistakes if there is any, English doesn’t happen to be my first language.I’d like to thank all of you who gave me truly helpful advice and even gave me some words of encouragement. There is quite a few comments but I’ll make sure to go over each and every one of them.There seems to be some confusion so I will clarify here, although if y’all need context on something else let me know in the comments..I am 18 years old. I currently don’t attend college because I’m trying to save up and just taking a gap year.My dad and my aunt have always been close, they were both addicts together, and they both made my mom’s life a living nightmare, some of you suggested that there may be a “sweet home alabama” type thing going on between them and I will tell you now that it is nothing if the sort.I may said a few very specific things about my aunt like how she has a grating voice, but most of my hatred towards her comes from how my mom would tell me stories on how my aunt and my dad would literally bully my mom and how one time they left her homeless with me and my two sister being >3 years old, my little sister being just a few months old.Some of you also said that I was seeking validation to a “very obvious” dilemma, but everyone around me has turned it on me, even my grandpa thinks I was wrong for not paying. Some of my friends are even saying I humiliated them because I should’ve been clear from the start, that’s why I decided to ask Reddit. ( note that I’m not mad about being told how “obvious” this may seem, it’s just that some people don’t know the full extent of the circumstances)I’m already looking for an apartment I can rent out for me and my sisters, I hate that it’s come to this, but I am done with my dad’s shenanigans.I’ll try to update if anything else happens, but for now, this is goodbye.",

	"title" : "AITA for deleting my cousin's wedding pictures that I wasn't paid for?",
	"body" : "My younger cousin's wedding was last December and she asked me to be the photographer for the wedding (I'm a semi-professional photographer). She told me what types of photos she wanted and I gave her a quote of just under 1k. Wedding happens, I take the pictures, I edit them, then wait for payment which we agreed I'd get in full after the wedding before sending any pictures. However suddenly she didn't have money and wanted to set up a payment plan to pay it off in 8 months AND still get the pictures now. It's not that I don't trust her but once you start opening such doors you'll find it hard to close them so I told her we could do the payment plan but the photos will only be released when the full amount is paid (didn't even add interest). She didn't respond. February rolls in and she asks to at least see 'samples' to confirm that they were worth the price. I sent 4 pictures and she says she'll show them to her husband and get back to me. Cue silence for a week or two until I asked for an update and she responded saying she's still discussing it with him. I told her this was getting long and she must just start paying now and she ignored me again.So I'd saved the photos on my roommate's flash drive temporarily while I was waiting on an actual hard drive. June came around and he texted me while I was at work saying he needed to use it and took it from my room but saw that there were still files on it. He couldn't move it to his laptop because it didn't have space (thus him needing the flash) so he was 'asking' if he could delete the files. I saw fine and he deleted them. I still had about 20 of the photos saved on my phone from when I was choosing/sending the samples so I just explained the situation in a message to her and sent the existing photos free of charge.That was last month and I'm still getting flamed for this. She's been slandering me online and it's quite literally created a division between our families and to the point that our mums don't talk now. I obviously feel bad but also feel like given the circumstances, I wasn't really in the wrong though still acknowledge that it's obviously very shitty for her that I would've wished to avoid. What do you guys think? AITA?",

	"title" : "AITA for refusing to adhere to my SIL’s Christmas gift list?",
	"body" : "For Christmas, my (30f) husband (30m) and I are hosting my parents, my brother Chris (34m), his wife Amy (33f), their two sons (6&4), my sister Lucia (27m), and her boyfriend Alex (30m).The background to all this is that Amy complains about every gift she is given by any of us. Every Christmas she makes faces and snide remarks about the things she’s gifted. For example, last year we (me and my husband) gifted Amy and Chris a joint present of an expensive coffee maker, which is the same one we have at home that Chris loved when they visited. Amy’s only remark - not even a thank you - was “oh well this isn’t really for me is it”, and then to make a great show of being annoyed that she didn’t get a separate gift.A few days ago, Amy included the whole family on a group email with a Christmas list for her and the kids, saying that she would only accept gifts from this list. On her list was expensive perfumes, links to expensive clothing items, and designer handbags. I was livid. My parents were offended as well but didn’t want to say anything to Amy but I wasn’t going to hold back in the face of what I felt was grossly entitled behaviour.I replied to Amy’s email saying I wouldn’t be purchasing anything on that list and that if she wanted to shop for a Louis Vuitton wallet I was happy to put her in touch with my saleswoman. I also said that if she didn’t like what she received for Christmas she was welcome to just leave it at my house.Chris blew up at me saying Amy was just trying to make everything easier for everyone by giving suggestions. I disagree and told him I think Amy was just trying to find a sneaky way to get a few things she normally can’t afford for free, which in my opinion is not in the spirit of Christmas and I think she’s being extremely childish.My parents think I shouldn’t have said anything but Lucia says I absolutely should have because she wasn’t going to be spending hundreds on Amy’s Christmas list either.Was I the AH for not going along with it?EDIT: 1. For everyone asking, yes Amy drinks coffee and uses the coffee machine.2. No, she and Chris do not gift anyone anything of them value of the items on her list. Chris does the Christmas shopping and our family is it big on adult gifting, we buy big things for the kids but we tend to get each other things like Christmas hampers (for couples), jumpers, I bought my mum a teapot one year, things like that. Certainly nothing in the price range Amy put on her list.",

	"title" : "AITA For following through with my word and reporting my disabled brother to adult services as abandoned after my parents tried to leave him with me?",
	"body" : "My brother Terry is non-verbal and, according to his specialist, has the intellectual/mental capacity of a very young child. Terry can still be very difficult to look after. He will experience meltdowns if something makes him uncomfortable (such as a food texture he does not like) or will throw fits if he cannot have his way. Terry has broken holes in the walls during his meltdowns/fits and I am honestly afraid of him whenever he becomes destructive that way because he is larger/stronger than me.I had been parentified by the time I was about thirteen because my parents expected me to handle Terry’s needs whenever they were busy or needed a break (which was often.) I have been upfront with my parents that I still hold resentment towards them because of this, and that Terry should not have been my responsibility to the extent they made him. My parents insist their parenting was perfect and are unwilling to alter their viewpoint. I have told them that I am not going to be Terry’s caregiver and to not leave him with me.Unfortunately, my parents know where I live. Recently, my parents have begun ringing my doorbell, telling me to watch Terry, and then leaving before I can say anything back. Then I’d have to cancel my plans and wait on the porch with Terry until they came back. When they came back, I told them all four times to stop doing this, but was ignored every time. I was forced to call out of work for the most recent “drop-off” incident. I lost my temper with my mother when she came to pick Terry up and told her that if she or my father try to leave Terry with me even one more time, I will call Adult Protective Services and report Terry as abandoned.A few days later, my mother again dropped Terry off on my porch and took off. So I followed through with my word and called to report Terry as an abandoned disabled adult. I waited with him on the porch until a social worker came. My parents exploded on me, calling me a horrible daughter and sister. They said they were barely able to get Terry back and accused me of only caring about myself and wanting Terry to be neglected in a public group home. I snapped at them that Terry would probably be better off in a public group home because they’re the ones neglecting him for their own convenience. And that I’m not going to keep putting my life on pause for their own personal comfort anymore.Now people (mostly friends of my parents) who I barely even knew or remembered before, are bombarding me with messages calling me selfish. A few have approached me in public to tell me that I don’t give a shit about my brother and I’m ungrateful for all the sacrifices that my parents made for me and Terry. I’ve already changed my phone number. But it’s getting so bad that I am considering applying for a job transfer and moving. AITA and are their words toward me deserved?Update: Hello, everyone. I am not sure if anyone is still reading this post. But I wanted to give a brief update in case anyone is still interested. I applied for the job transfer and was approved. I will be completely moved to my new city in a few weeks. I have only told a few close friends, so they could help me move discretely. I have not told my parents that I am moving or my new address. And my friends know to either not tell them or give them an imaginary address. I wanted to thank everyone for your kind words and support. :)",

	"title" : "AITA for snapping back when my friend’s boyfriend commented on my bikini?",
	"body" : "I (F29) am in a group holiday with my fiancé and three other couples. We are renting a big villa. This story concerns my friend Casey (30) and her boyfriend Josh (30).For context, I don’t hate Josh, but he requires a firm approach. He will try his “brutal honesty” stuff on you to see if you’ll let him get away with it, but once you show him you won’t put up with it, he calms down. That said, he’s prone to some stupid remarks.So, yesterday we were all having a relaxed day by the pool. I came out of the house in my bikini and Josh wolf whistled and said “damn I really chose the wrong friend” loud enough for everyone to hear. Without missing a beat I turned to him and said “why are you acting like you had your pick of the litter? I would never have looked at you twice and you know it”.Josh laughed off the comment and and went back to reading his book, but Casey pulled me inside and yelled at me for embarrassing her and Josh. She said what I said was demeaning and I basically called Josh ugly. I was pretty stunned because actually I think what happened was Josh called me a piece of meat. We argued and I basically said that I wasn’t responsible for her boyfriend’s crass behaviour and went back outside.Casey is still giving me the cold shoulder, as well as the three people who told her she was overreacting. It’s making everything awkward. I don’t think I’m in the wrong here but some of the group have said I was overly cutting with what I said, considering Josh was already out of line. Basically they said I joined him in the gutter. My fiancé says both Casey and Josh are nut jobs.Am I the one who took it too far?",
